years now three years on staff uh coming this June and we love what we get to do uh in youth ministry investing in the Next Generation and every time I get the microphone I've got pastor's blessing uh to talk about uh our amazing youth ministry I am 1,000% biased in case you are wondering uh but we've got a pretty great youth ministry and just even love some of the stuff that God is stirring uh through our young people in fact this past Wednesday uh we preached a message about overcoming uh the fear of failure and I had the wonderful uh privilege to uh lead our high school guys group and one of the questions I asked them I said if uh what more would you do for God if you didn't let the fear of failure hold you back and one of them raised their hand and said pastor Andrew I'd answer the call to preach just like you I'd grab a microphone and I'd preach the gospel I was like ooo that's a good start I was like good luck topping that answer and another young man raised his hand and said Well if I knew I wouldn't fail I'd go into every hospital I could find I'd lay hands on cancer patients and I would pray they'd get healed I was like boy quit playing you getting in my car right now we about to drive to every hospital that we can and then the third one raised his hand and I was like man they keep setting the bar good luck and he goes Pastor Andrew I would answer the call to be a missionary and I'd go to places like Germany and Kenya and I would preach the gospel I was like y'all come on somebody God is just stirring up some incredible things in our teenagers and we want every

our lives to open the door to allow to God to allow God to come in and work in us so that he can work through us and today I just for the next few moments want to talk to you uh with today's message being titled own your serve own your serve so if you got your Bible turn it on and go to Matthew chapter 20 yeah I know what generation we're living in for crying out loud turn it on go to Matthew chapter 20 and cut to set the stage for uh this text we're about to read and the message I I really feel like God has called me to preach uh to our church today I want to take you back to my high school days which I used to say was not that long ago and then I keep having these birthdays and I'm like it keeps getting further and further and further away so it would have been wow almost like N9 or 10 years ago I played on our junior varsity uh basketball team okay don't let my height fool you okay I was a Hooper believe it or not in Indiana okay but it was a small Christian School yo we had Le it was K through 12 we had less than 300 enrolled so they were like are you abled bodied you can be on the basketball team so that's how I got on the basketball team but uh I made junior varsity I think it was my it was my uh my freshman or sophomore year and our school hosted this tournament with other schools kind of like in our conference or in our uh in our city if you will and so I remember uh going through that tournament on a Saturday and uh we did not win every game we played I know that surprises some of you but we didn't uh we weren't great and so we get to the last game of the tournament and we find out the team we're playing is undefeated in this tournament and if they beat us they get the championship trophy for the tournament on our home court so we were kind of like we don't want another team to hold this team to hold up a trophy on our home court where you're like well Pastor Andrew somebody's going to have to hold up a trophy that's not you because you're not playing for first place but this school they were our Rivals so we did not like them they did not like us so we made it our mission you know what we're going to make sure they don't win on our home court so we play this game against our bitter rival and Y I promise you I was ready to get football pads and a helmet on because it did not feel like a basketball game like we were just beating the mess out of each other stuff was getting called stuff wasn't getting called physical I mean brutal lows scoring like how many you remember like back in the 80s and 90s when you could like truck somebody and a foul wasn't going to get called like yes we're in Indiana for crying out loud like this is the kind of game it was and so there's like less than 10 seconds to go it's a one possession game they're winning by two or three points and I remember a shot goes up and I go for a rebound and I end up getting in a jump ball situation now for those of you who don't know basketball a jump ball is when uh two players from two different teams get possession of the ball and they're tied up so the ref calls jump ball and he gives possession to whoever the possession arrow is pointing to okay so I didn't even know who the possession arrow belonged to I was just like I'm going to make it my mission to get this ball okay like 5 foot five and all at the time 100 pound soak and wet did not kill so the guy who uh I get in the jump ball situation with is a lot bigger than me and some of you are like well Pastor Andrew he didn't have to be very big to be bigger than you but he I'm talking he was probably 61 like he was skinny but he was taller so he had leverage okay but I'm in this jump ball situation the ref calls a jump ball I'm like sweet let's go baby so I go to let go of the ball because the ref called jump ball but instead of letting go of the ball my opponent decides to pick me up and body slam me on the court so I'm thinking like he's getting teed up he's getting ejected he's never playing basketball again his career is done get him out of here get him on the bus wait till the game is over right so I look over at the officials I'm like lying on the ground like my arm is hurting like it's actually going numb and I'm like freaking out and the ref's like okay ball goes to the red team inbound let's go while I'm lying there on the court like screaming my head off and I'm like is homeboy really going to keep this game going like I know there's 10 seconds left but I'm like I'm dying here on the court about to see Jesus come and take me home and you just like yeah play on brother like come on so my coach runs out on the court he is like screaming face all red at the referee my dad comes down to make sure I'm okay the ref is telling them to get off my court now how many of you know like when your parents concerned for the well-being of a kid and you have the nerve to go tell him like sir I need you to get off the court um I didn't go over well now my dad is talking to the ref of their parents are talking to the ref like it's starting to get a little ugly now what ends up happening the guy that body slammed me he was like he was close enough to where I could hear him but far away enough to where like he wasn't going to get in trouble if you know what I'm saying and he's like chirping at me like talking smack like yeah you want some more and our Center on the basketball team 6'4 250 pounds I mean built like a Mac Truck walks over there it's like hey boy you need to shut your mouth like you just body Slamm my dude over here and then our power forward he comes over 6'2 220 y'all he doesn't say anything he throat punches the guy that body Slammy and from there it is like y'all remember Pacers Pistons brawl from 2004 mass chaos ensues and I'm lying there holding my arm like what is going on coaches are fighting players are fighting referees are fighting fans are fighting bleachers cleared benches cleared I'm like what is going on now the part I left out of the story was I may or may not have played for a Christian School and the team we played may or may not have been another Christian school so I'm lying there and I'm like you have got to be kidding me this is getting nuts and so finally how all of this ends the head referee he goes to the center of the court and he calls the game that did not deescalate anything because the other team they were up on us with 10 seconds left we had the ball for one final shot they get the trophy it wasn't much of a trophy celebration if you know what I mean because they to say they were getting booed uh by our fans after everything that happened is an understatement but I remember they're like taking me into the locker room they're ready to like take me to the hospital to get me checked out and everything I remember like getting in that locker room so one number one I'm like what just happened number two I was so disappointed because our primary objective was we showed up to play a basketball game to hopefully win it but to finish it at the end of the day and because we got distracted doing something completely unrelated to what we came to do we missed out on an opportunity to finish to gain Victory and instead we watched the enemy hold up a trophy on our home gym and that I tell you that story because I believe it sets up this text perfectly we know that Jesus had many followers but he specifically selected 12 of them to do life with him to walk closely with him and to do ministry in the trenches with him if you will however two of them got distracted and forgot to keep the main thing the main thing they forgot why Jesus called them and they got distracted with things that didn't matter and it began to spread with the other 12 and so when we pick up in our text we learn about two of these disciples they Brothers their names are James and John they're called the son they're nickname the sons of thunder and in this story we're about to read they make a pretty big request if you read in Matthew chapter 20 it says that their mother brought both of them to Jesus we can go ahead and read it together then the mother of zebede sons came to Jesus with her sons James and John kneeling down and asked the favor of Jesus what is it you want he asked she said grant that one of these two sons sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom now how many of you know that's a bold audacious thing to ask Jesus like hey I'm a mama I want what's best for my boys I know you got a lot of disciples but I need you to play favorites and pick my two I don't care who's who one of them's got to sit on your right one of them's got to sit on your left now how do you think the other 10 felt when they heard this the Bible tells us how they felt verse 24 says when the other 10 heard about this they were indignant with the two brothers now I don't have time to go in and explain how the New Testament of the Bible is originally written in Greek and what that Greek word specifically means but this word indignant in the Greek does not mean that they were just upset or they were frustrated or that they were bothered or offended they were heated their emotions got involved they were they were infuriated by this request and there's an there's a parallel account of the story in Mark's gospel that gives us more insight on how Jesus specifically handled this situation let's read in Mark chapter 9 uh let's go verse 33 it says when Jesus was in the house he asked them what were you arguing about on the road now how many you know when God asks a question he doesn't really need information he knows the answer but he's he's going to get it out of them verse 34 it says they kept quiet because on the way they argued about who was the greatest now in my opinion that's really silly to argue amongst yourself about who's the greatest when you're walking with Jesus you're talking about grown men fighting like children grown men doing the whole I can run faster than you my Daddy can beat up your daddy kind of routine or like you're ugly your mama dresses you funny like what are we doing but it's actually much deeper than two men arguing over their fantasy football team it's much deeper than two people arguing if MJ is better than LeBron or if LeBron is better than MJ which the Bible clearly tells I'm just kidding it doesn't say anything about that you're like false teacher heretic we're gonna avoid that on a serious level though Jesus he addresses this he actually called them together in verse 25 of Matthew 20 he says you know that the rulers of the Gentiles they Lord it over them he's talking about Authority he says and their High officials exercise authority over them but not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many so Jesus said that according to their world greatness was defined by power power and position and I believe our society defines greatness the same way today thousands of years later that the more Authority somebody has the more money somebody has the more success and Prestige somebody has the more popularity the more influence the more experience somebody has that's what the world says it means to be great that's what was going on with James and John and not much has changed thousands of years later and part of me honestly wonders if the disciples were so upset with James and John only because they hadn't thought of it to ask the question first themselves but Jesus was teaching his followers back then and is teaching you and me now we have to think differently than the world thinks remember in verse 26 Jesus said this is how the Gentiles Define greatness but not so with you you're called to think differently it reminds me of what the Apostle Paul wrote in Romans 12:2 he says don't conform don't fit in don't give into the pattern of this world what they think how they operate what they value and what they believe he says instead you need to be transformed by the renewing of your mind he says you're called to think differently you're called to behave differently you're called to serve and to make a difference family God is not looking for a kingdom buil built with superstars he's looking for a kingdom who that's built with servants later on in Matthew Jesus would give a parable to teach his disciples a point about serving and about greatness and he shows us a picture that a servant is actually a steward In this passage Matthew 25 it gives us great insight to what God is looking for today in a true servant so in this text sometimes what's helpful is when you can Define what something isn't it will help you better understand what it actually actually is and that's what Jesus does in this story for the sake of time today I'm not going to read the whole entire passage to you I would encourage you to make time today or this week and read it for yourself and allow God to speak to you but I want to unpack it for you in this story it's actually a parable Jesus tells and I like to tell our teenagers the parable is literally a madeup story Jesus did um to teach a point but it's actually it's a very well put together story that Jesus would use to teach Prince IES to his followers in this Parable he tells it's about a successful businessman in three uh specific employees of his he's going on a journey far away and he grabs these three employees and he says I'm going to entrust some of my talents to you I need you to be stewards I need you to be responsible I need you to take care of this I'm entrusting it to you while I'm gone and when I return you will give me an account for what you did with what I gave you that rightfully belongs to me okay I hope you're listening with your spiritual ears this morning so he gives the Bible says he gave each of them talents according to his own ability so one of his employees he gave five talents another he gave two and then the last employee he gave one talent and the Bible says he goes on his journey and when he returns ready to for his employees to give an account of what they did with the talents the first one comes the one he gave the five talents and he said Master while you were gone I took what you gave me and I doubled it so now you don't just have five talents you've got 10 talents and he says well done my good and faithful servant he goes to the next employee who had two talents and he says Master while you were away I took what you gave me and I doubled it as well you don't just have two talents now but you have four and he looks at the second employee and he says well done my good and faithful servant he gets to the last employee with the one talent and then we'll begin reading let's read Matthew 25: 24 it says he also who had received the one Talent came forward saying master I knew you to be a hard man reaping where you did not seow and Gathering where you Gathering sorry I lost my place pray for the youth pastor it's my second time preaching I got one more to go too Gathering where you scattered no seed so I was afraid and I went and hid your talent in the ground here you have what is yours is verse 26 his master answered him well done my good and faithful servant I'm just playing y'all that's not what he said he says you Wicked and slothful servant you knew that I reap where I have not sown and you gather where I scattered no seed then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest so take the talent from him and give it to him who has the 10 talents for to everyone who has will more be given and he will have an abundance but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away and cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness in that place there will be weeping and nashing of teeth now some of you all like this story started great and it went dark fast but I believe it is a such a powerful picture of what God is not looking for in us as his servants and what he's also looking for in us as his servants and there's a lot I want to unpack in this text today to help you answer the call as a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ the first thing we gather from this story number one God is looking for servants who are Kingdom Minded not self-centered kingd Dem minded not self centered so there was one servant he had had five talents what did he do he doubled it and produced 10 there was another he had two what did he do he doubled it and he produced four but the last one when he received it he dug into the ground and hid it and did nothing so we see two of them put the work in but one of them took the easy way out one of them settled for shortcuts why because it was personally more comfortable and convenient for him two of them were focused on serving their master and his work but the other one was more focused on himself being a servant is not about focusing on what benefits you it's about what benefits who you serve Jesus used himself as an example when he said for the son of man did not come to be served but he came to serve he says I literally gave my life to serve people and now how many of you know if anybody deserves to be served it's the King of Kings the Lord of lords and the master of all Jesus knew his time was limited on the earth 33 34 years a three-year Ministry and yet his heart was I did not come to be served I came to give my life away to serve my father's business he mo mod what was important in the kingdom of God it wasn't about the people that had the seats of prominence or power or who were focused on themselves and today People's Church I want you to understand God is looking for servants who are Kingdom Minded like Jesus and not self centered now I don't know about you but I have to work really really hard at this because when I'm self-centered it's all about what's convenient for me what's comfortable for me my preferences my needs my desires my expectations it's about everybody else catering to what's best for me what's easiest for me what's convenient for me but when I'm focused on myself I lose sight of my responsibility as a follower of Jesus to Steward my life in God's kingdom but God is Not Looking for servants who are self-c centered he's looking for servants that are Kingdom centered and Kingdom Minded number two God is looking for servants who are faithful not fickle faithful not fickle now this is like the middle school boy coming out of me but I think fickle is a funny word like I don't hear it every day in my conversation so I was like what does the word fickle mean it starts with the letter F so I thought it sounded good but you see fickle means this something or someone being volatile unreliable flaky and unpredictable and when I read that I was like oo I can be fickle sometimes I like to serve when I feel like it but it's harder to serve when I don't feel like it it's harder to serve my wife when I don't feel like it it's hard to serve our youth ministry and our church when I don't feel like it it's hard to serve my family my boss my my co-workers when I don't feel like it how many of you know I like being considered a servant until people start treating me like I'm one it's like God use me I'm yours I'm your servant I'll make room for you right and then it's like wait God I'm just I feel like I'm being used like what did you pray for right no but seriously when it's all about me I lose sight of what I'm called to do when I give into my flesh I can be fickle I can be inconsistent I can be lazy but God's not looking for a Fickle servant he's looking for a faithful one look at again in Matthew 25:21 this is how he commended the servant he honored his master said to him well done good and faithful servant he was faithful he was trustworthy and God honored that because a true servant understands they serving the lord no matter what they're doing Colossians 3:23 Paul said whatever you do you are cardly as for the Lord and not for men you're not just working a job to get a paycheck you're not just working for a man or a woman you're not just serving or volunteering at an organization you are serving and working for the Lord Jesus he needs somebody faithful not fickle and we have so many Faithful Servants here in our church showing up and serving week after week they're responsible they're reliable they're hardworking they serving in the parking lot when it's cold when it's rainy and when it's windy they're serving in pey kids on Sundays and epic youth on Wednesday nights they're coming straight from work to start loving and investing in teenagers they're showing up early on Sunday morning to pray over all three services and to lead us into God's presence on the worship team I'm thankful for our Dream Team because serving and making a difference is what it's all about God is looking for somebody who is faithful and not fickle see God is Not only looking for somebody faithful and not fickle but he's also looking for servants who are fruitful and not fruitless you see I I praise God I celebrate faithfulness I believe faithfulness should be honored but I also believe that there's a difference between faithfulness and fruitfulness and I'm not speaking about anybody or any group of people specific to this church I'm talking about the body of Christ universally around the world when I say this but I believe there are people being celebrated for sitting in the same Pew every single Sunday 25 years calling that faithfulness but there's no fruit in their life they're not serving they're not investing in people they're not discipling others this is not listen this is not condemnation this is not rebuke you see I want you to understand this today there is no fruitfulness without faithfulness but you can be faithful and not be fruitful God has called you and me to both be faithful and fruitful not one or the other look in verse 21 again Jesus said well done you did something you accomplished something there's fruit on your tree you produced results you see true faithfulness is fruitfulness we cannot be content Church listen to me we cannot be content to be on the sidelines and wear a Jersey no we have to learn how to get in the game and put points on the board for the kingdom of God we have people who step up and serve on First Impressions so that every guest comes in feeling loved and welcomed and they have a great experience in God's presence we have people in growth tracks so that others can discover their purpose and make a difference we have people leading small groups so that people can grow in their relationship with God and experience Community there is a purpose behind every Ministry there's a purpose behind every serve there is a purpose behind every opportunity and if it's not fruitful then it's truly not faithful God wants us to serve not to sit not to sour he called us to produce fruit in John 158 Jesus said this this is to my father's Glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples God wants his servants to use their god-given talents to fulfill their God given purpose friend we're called to produce fruit you see the master he had a he had a reason for giving those talents to his servants God has a reason for giving you the gifts that you possess the resources you possess the opportunities you possess the abilities that you possess we have a responsibility to do something with that and we need to own it Ephesians 2:10 Paul said we are God's handiwork we're created in his son Christ Jesus to do good works that God prepared in advance for us to do 1 Peter 4:10 each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms Paul in Romans 12 I won't read this whole passage to you but he basically says this he says look if God's given you a gift you need to use it to bless the body of Christ he says if he's given you the ability to prophesy then prophesy if he's given you the gift of serving then serve if he's given you the gift of teaching then teach if he's given you the gift to encourage then be an encourager if he's given you the gift of leadership then take the responsibility seriously and Lead if he's given you the gift to show kindness do it gladly then verse n he says don't pretend to love others really love them hates what hate what is wrong hold tightly to what is good love each other with genuine affection take Delight in honoring each other and in verse 11 don't be lazy come on look over at somebody said don't you dare be lazy he says work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically this is a different way of thinking church as Servants of God we understand God has blessed us so that we can be a blessing we're gifted for his glory and not our own he's called us to build his church God's given you all so many different abilities to play instruments or to sing he some of you are gifted in production or graphic design photography what some of you are Craftsmen you're great with your hands some of you are people people you can interact you're extroverted you have strong people skills whatever gift you have use it to build his church see no one can do everything but all of us can do something God has a purpose and a plan for your life but you're responsible to own it to Steward it well God is looking for servants who are Kingdom Minded not self-centered he's looking for servants who are faithful not fickle he's looking for servants who are fruitful and not fruitless and then lastly number four God is looking for servants he can reward not rebuke in the parable the servants he called the one who hid his talent Wicked and lazy and worthless he was thrown into judgment some like Pastor Andrew that's really harsh I don't want you to miss the the big picture that Jesus is holding his disciples accountable says you love me said you follow me said you're going to serve me why haven't you done what you said you're going to do how many you know we like it when other people get held accountable but when it comes to us being held accountable sometimes it's uncomfortable but in First Corinthians 3 this is really convicting Paul says anyone who builds on that Foundation may use a variety of materials he's talking about our lives gold silver jewels wood hay or straw but on the Judgment Day fire will re feel what kind of work each Builder has done the fire will show if a person's work has any value if the work survives the Builder will receive a reward but if the work is burned up the Builder will suffer great loss the Builder will be saved but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames I don't know about you but when I stand before God in eternity on Judgment Day I give him everything back he ever gave me I say God here's what I did with the marriage you gave me here's what I did with the ministry you gave me here's what I did with the family the finances the gifts God everything here it is and the Bible says it will be tested by fire and when it goes through the refiner fire you'll figure out if it was built on something that will last or if it was built on something that will fade away and be burned up I don't want to build my marriage on wood hay and stubble I don't want to build my Ministry on something that will burn up in ref Fire's fire I want to build it on something that will last for eternity and have eternal value and impact in the kingdom of God that when I say Lord I wasn't perfect and I didn't always get it right with everything you gave me but God everything you gave me that I'm giving back to you on this day I want it to be produced as gold as silver as precious medals that are valuable to the Lord because everything I did for you God it was for eternity and it was not my own listen I want you to understand God's heart is to reward you not rebuke you he Jesus confronted his disciples you can be sure you will give an account for your life before God someday the great thing is that we don't serve to try to re avoid rebuke or correction we serve because there's a reward and I know there's different Church backgrounds represented here maybe you came from a church background that thinks it's wrong to want to be rewarded by God but when I read this book cover to cover I can't help but see God is the one who set the system in place for us to serve and to be rewarded friend the reward the Eternal reward was God's idea it was not man's some people may think it's wrong to be excited that we look forward to a reward from serving God someday but he's the one that set it up like this he rewards faithfulness and fruitfulness Colossians 3:24 says known from the Lord you'll receive an inheritance as your reward in Matthew 16 and verse 27 Jesus says for the son of man's going to come in his father's Glory with his angels then he will reward each person according to what they have done Revelation 22:12 says look I'm coming soon bringing my reward with me come on anybody thankful Jesus is going to come back soon and fix this mess and he's bringing a reward with me to pay all the people according to their own Deeds what an amazing thought church I'm excited and I cannot wait but friend we need to be responsible with what God has entrusted into us today I believe all of us have a next step your most important step the best step you can take is always your next one today I believe there are some who are not actively serving here at People's Church and there are some who are this is not a message of judgment but it very much is a it is a call it is a challenge and an encouragement to get in the game God didn't give you a Jersey to sit there and look pretty he wants you to get in a game he wants you to get dirty he wants you to make a difference today we're a church that's we serve because that's we want to model the heart of God as best as possible Jesus came to serve we're here in Indianapolis and in Oklahoma City to serve our community and to serve people and to make a difference that's what Jesus has called us to do we're going to be obedient to every single word from Genesis to Revelation so today I want to because we're a church that's committed to serving we're committed to next steps we're going to give everybody an opportunity today just to pray and invite the Holy Spirit to search us and just have a moment of accountability between us and God our team is going to put a QR code here on the screens in a moment and if you scan that QR code it'll actually show you the serving opportunities we have on our Dream Team here at people's church we would love for you to be a part of our first impressions team to help us have 52 Unforgettable Sundays for more families to come and be a part of our church for lost hurting dying broken people to come in and never be the same because they had an encounter with God and part of it was because you serve we need more men and women of God who love love children and want to invest in teenagers to serve in PC kids on Sundays and to serve at Epic youth on

the day who knows where to work the rabbit ears to get that channel on you know but but i thank god when i got some cable television i remember when i got texting i didn't know anything about texting

this past week and there he goes with his christmas hat on how many know children if you have children it changed your world it changed everything in your world having children changed our world but church nothing has changed my life more than when jesus appeared when jesus appeared it didn't just change my life it changed the course of the entire human history and i want to talk to you about our theme verse today when jesus appeared isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 4 says for to us a child is born to us a son is given to us a child appeared to us the son of god appeared and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace and he's not just a wonderful counselor or mighty god or everlasting father or prince of peace he's my wonderful counselor he's my mighty god he's my everlasting father he's my prince of peace because jesus appeared over the next four weeks myself and pastor chris we want to help you know jesus as your wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace and we don't want it just to be head knowledge can i tell you that you could have a relationship with jesus christ when he appeared he came to have relationship that you could know him personally and today we're going to look at how jesus is a mighty god everybody's almighty god yeah yeah prophesied this particular verse prophesied about 700 years before jesus was born and he said these things about jesus he's going to be a wonderful counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father about 700 years before he was ever born he said jesus would be a mighty god in the hebrew if you kind of dive into the word study here in the hebrew this this whole mighty god means that jesus is a warrior he's a fighter he's a conqueror i remember growing up in wica oklahoma and some of you have never heard me preach before and you go where in the world is we woke up i always want people to know it's right near walika with tomka sasakwa holdenville and bow legs now everybody knows where that is and so that's where i grew up and i i can remember i had my little younger sister was about 11 months younger than me had an older brother four years older than me and i was in junior high and i was talking trash anybody remember back in the day when you would have you know about daddy will whoop your daddy who knows what i'm talking about my daddy will whoop your daddy remember your mama jokes your mama is soul and i was telling your mama jokes and and one one boy said to me i'm gonna beat you up talking about my mama you don't want none you don't want none you don't wanna meet me after school okay meet me after school you don't want none you don't wanna meet me you have to go meet me in the aisle of me i'll meet you and i'll meet me in the alley i mean you don't want none after school was over i didn't want none i went and got my older brother you know what i'm saying four years older i walked up to the alley come on i walked in that alley like what you want you back there yeah my older brother was about six inches taller than me he was in high school that boy he looked at me you know what he did when he saw my mighty brother he left because between me and my older brother we was going to wear him out and can i tell you that jesus is our mighty god i mean he's like a superhero of all super heroes superman batman wonder woman black panther the incredible hulk don't have anything on jesus jesus is a mighty god there are some people that view jesus as this nice loving wimp like he's a pushover he's a powerless fuzzy teddy bear church no no no you serve a mighty god he's a defeat he's defeated death hell and the grave he's a warrior he's an undefeated king he's a conquering king i've come here to ask you here indeed is there anybody that needs a mighty god in your corner today maybe you find yourself going through a challenging season in life maybe today you look back over thanksgiving a week ago and it was horrible so much family dissension so much drama maybe during this holiday season you find yourself lonely you find yourself hurting in your heart maybe you just received a bad doctor's report perhaps you're struggling at your job or maybe you even found out recently that you're getting laid off from your job maybe you've made a bad decision that's causing so much pain in your life maybe it's somebody else who made the bad decision but it's impacting your life in a negative way and you're looking at your life you're looking at your situation and you're thinking what do i do i don't see any way out of this maybe you're thinking to yourself there's no way this situation could ever change it's horrible and i've come here to tell somebody what you need today is you need a mighty god to show up on the scene you need jesus to show up in your situation he's a miracle-working god he's a devil defeating god he's a circumstance changing god he's an overcoming god and you need him to display his power in your situation i've come here to tell somebody no matter what you're facing our god is able church i said our god is able no matter what you're facing today nothing is impossible with the lord matthew 19 verse 26 says jesus looked at them and said with man this is impossible but with god all get your situation in your mind you think it's impossible i'm telling you with god all things are possible because we serve a mighty god jot this down jot this down number one he's mighty jesus is mighty to save he's mighty to save god can save the worst of sinners nobody is too far away from god that he can't reach them and save them the apostle paul said in first timothy chapter 1 and verse 15 and 16 this is a trustworthy saying and everyone should accept it christ jesus came into the world to save sinners and i am the worst of them all but god had mercy on me so that christ jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners then others will realize that they too can believe in him and receive eternal life god has saved the worst of sinners and i want somebody to hear this today and he's still saving the worst of sinners is there anybody else that felt like me when i did not know the lord jesus i felt like i was the worst of sinners i was out there i was i was out there i was sexually abused at the age of 13 and my lady and i spiraled into sexual promiscuity and sexual addiction and pornography and i was angry never told my parents my parents ended up getting a divorce and i was already dealing with all the pain and the anger of abuse and confused and mine not right and my parents divorcing and i just found myself angry and hostile found myself in a bad place the worst of sinners lying and cheating and it was one day at football practice our coach said we were having a fellowship a christian athletes meeting after football practice and i wasn't planning on going i was actually being recruited to play college football a recruiter was coming down that night to talk to me and my dad from a university to recruit me to their university and he called me up and said herbert i'm not going to be able to make it down tonight i'm stuck in oklahoma city but i'll be there tomorrow to meet with you and your dad so i was bombed but i remember that there was something happening in about an hour the fellowship of christian athletes meeting but i wasn't interested in that but i did hear they were having free pizza and so that night i went to the football locker room in my nissan datsun pickup with speakers all lined in the back and i based my way there who knows what i'm talking about boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and i got to the football locker room and i walked in there some of you remember george jefferson that's how i walked in just mad swag cool walked in got me some pizza set on the football locker and that night tom taught todd thompson the former kicker for the oklahoma sooners he shared about jesus that he died on the cross that he rose again if i would trust jesus with my life he would forgive me of all of my sins and change my life the locker room was packed full of football players i was a senior on the team i was a captain on the team being recruited to play college football but at that moment i didn't care what anybody else thought tears started streaming down my face and that night i gave my life to jesus i walked in the worst of sinners and i walked out changed and forgiven by the power of jesus christ because jesus is mighty to save and i'm here to tell somebody no matter what you've done no matter how far away you may feel from god he's mighty to save you i don't care what your child has done how far your child is away from god how far your spouse or your family member is away from god god can still reach them with his power because our god is mighty to save i want you to know a second thing and that is this jesus is mighty to heal he's mighty to heal isaiah said in chapter 53 and verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of for our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed this past wednesday night i was at church and a lady walked up to me we were having a prayer service at 6 30 p.m and she said pastor can i share something with you i said absolutely and amy said well a few weeks ago i was went to the doctor and got a bad doctor's report and i shared with pastor shelby and pastor shelby prayed for me and i went back to the doctor and it's documented that god healed my body i said pastor shelby why don't you call amy on the stage this past wednesday night and let her share her testimony with the church and i want you to hear this testimony from this past wednesday night check this out i mean our god is mighty to heal he's still healing bodies today he can heal your body today he's mighty to heal and i want somebody to know god heals everybody whether you receive your healing in on earth or whether you receive your healing in heaven our god is going to ultimately heal heal everybody's body but can i tell you he does still he'll heal right here on earth and he doesn't just heal our bodies he heals our minds he heals our emotions psalms chapter 147 verse 3 says he heals the brokenhearted and he binds up their wounds and i want somebody to know that struggling with emotional you're struggling with just this weight of pain i know what it's like i believe my greatest healing that has come in my life has been the healing over emotional pain and sexual abuse and got married and keeping tiffany out and didn't trust and you know what why are you doing that suspicious of everything not letting anybody in i'm never going to be in one of those small groups i don't need people i'm keeping people away from me but i'm a living witness because jesus is mighty to heal he's healed my broken heart my marriage is stronger than it's ever been i trust people more than i've ever trusted people because our god is mighty to heal and somebody needs to know your heart is hurting it's been broken in a million pieces our god can heal your broken heart he can bring healing to your life because jesus is mighty to heal i want you to know a third thing about our jesus and that is jesus is mighty to set you free mighty to set you free john chapter 8 and verse 36 says so if the son sets you free you will be free in deed i'm wondering if there are a handful of people today that you were bound in some addiction that you found yourself just addicted to something and jesus has set you free is there anybody bold enough just to throw up a hand and say you're talking to me god set me free from some stuff come on everybody that's been set free by jesus come on let's take five seconds and just give jesus some praise around this place today come on come on you ought to just give god some praise for setting you free you ought to give god some thanks right now for setting you free come on your life is changed come on i gotta take about five seconds and give god some praise that he set me free from pornography that that he set me free from lying and he set me free from cheating he set me free from cussing that but he set herbert cooper free and when the sun sets you free you're free in deed while jesus is mighty to set free shelby who you just saw on the video he was addicted to cocaine for years addicted strung out selling it and 30 years ago he surrendered his life to jesus and jesus christ set shelby free from a horrific cocaine drug addiction and now today he's on staff at people's church a former drug addict and now he's a pastor on our staff because i want somebody to know that jesus is mighty to speak to set people free he's been clean of drugs for 30 years mighty to set free number four is this number four is this jesus is mighty to provide mighty to provide when tiffany and i were engaged i decided i really want to bless her with a wonderful wonderful honeymoon that i did not have the money for but i had that credit card back from arkansas come on somebody so i i charged that thing up and we were gonna go we went to a cruise to the bahamas on credit and then got back from the bahamas and moved to missouri and we're living in an apartment and in our little apartment we had no furniture and so we went to hank's fine furniture store and we bought us living room set and dining room said we bought all the furniture we needed on credit because we didn't have any money we had student loan debt now credit card debt we had car debt and i was a traveling evangelist my first year out of college i had no idea that i was supposed to pay quarterly taxes i was considered self-employed i didn't know that so after the first year of traveling in january uh somebody recommended a a tax preparer so i went to him and he was preparing my taxes and said mr cooper did you pay your quarterly taxes i said what you're talking about he said yeah you got to pay your taxes quarterly i didn't know that he goes yeah you owe the government 500 say what i owe 500 what yeah you owe the government 500 we have all this debt we're newly married got married at 22 and 20 and this was overwhelming i went to go preach at a church and while i was in the city preaching another pastor that i was not preaching for me and him went to lunch and we went to lunch that day and we had a great time and we talked and we laughed i shared nothing with him about what i was going through at the end of that lunch he handed me an envelope and guess what was in the envelope a check for 500 and my wife and i paid our taxes and i'm here just to tell somebody years ago i can testify god is a mighty god and god will meet our needs it's biblical that god meets our needs philippians chapter 4 and verse 19 says that my god will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in christ jesus and god has met our needs time and time again i can remember living in in springfield missouri and after all of that debt after that tax bill something happened we paid that tax bill we said we're getting ourselves out of debt and we just went crazy to get out of debt in her early 20s tiffany was a part-time she was a full-time student and worked part-time at kohl's i was a traveling evangelist and i substitute talk from time to time especially when we first launched herbert cooper ministries a traveling ministry and we just said we're going to live on nothing we're going to eat ramen noodles and we're going to get out of debt and so we just went crazy and paid off car debt and paid off all of our student loan debt and paid off all the credit card debt and tiffany graduated from college we're debt-free and we bought our very first home for like 89 000 and man we're so fired up and god speaks to us man here we are debt-free and you know we have money in the bank we bought our first house and life's going well my traveling schedule is full god is blessing and god says i'm calling you all to go start a multicultural church awesome god who's going to give the money you are ha i mean god we just got ourselves out of debt we just but we were obedient to god and we sold our home in missouri and we moved to oklahoma and we bought all the equipment thousands of dollars we just took the savings that we had and we bought the equipment and we started people's church in a movie theater with 65 people on may 12th 2002 and can i tell you i look back and god provided all of our needs and we didn't miss a meal that first year of the church plant we didn't take a salary from the church tiffany worked as a school teacher and we wondered how this is going to happen how are we going to eat but can i tell you we never missed a meal it wasn't steak and fri steak and potatoes but we ate some good hamburger helper come on somebody some ramen noodles but god come on god provided for all of our needs the second year of the church we were very part-time i mean nobody's going to say you're going to start a church and not be able to take a salary for two years and you're going to survive but i'm telling you i look back i wouldn't advise it for anybody else but i'm telling you the lord met all of our needs according to his riches in glory in christ jesus and then here we are in our late 20s the church is growing in the movie theater we're running for 500 people we we're a church is buying our very first piece of property getting ready to build a building and tiffany and i we have just always said we're going to always we've always been tithers we always give above our tithe we said we're going to make a sacrificial gift that's crazy we don't know how we're going to do it and we committed over two-year period in our late 20s 20 000 over and above our tithe didn't know how we would do it but can i tell you i look back at that first campaign that we did and we bought that building i bought that land built that building and god used us over two years in our twenties to give twenty thousand and we never missed a meal and we moved into that new location over a thousand people showed up and the church never felt under a thousand after that day and just reached so many people with the gospel of jesus christ with the love of god because we sacrificed and we gave can i tell you god will supply all of your needs according to his riches in glory in christ jesus you say well pastor pastor pastor i'm not experiencing that i've never experienced god supplying all of my needs why am i not experiencing that in my personal life well so many people don't understand that this verse verse 19 is a conditional verse that in in other words if you do this god says then i'll do this if you do this then i'll do this well pastor what is the thing that we have to do let me show this to you somebody's going to get a secret to understand how god will meet all of your needs according to his riches in glory philippians chapter number four and verse 15 says this more more moreover as you philippians know in the earlier days we're looking at the content you've got to get the context of verse 19 so we're going up to verse 15. in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel when i set out from macedonia not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only it's so interesting that paul didn't just say you were the only church that shared with me in the matter of giving he said something interesting you shared with me in giving and receiving whenever you give to god he always gives back to you it's giving and receiving it's seedtime and harvest verse 16 says for when i was in thessalonica you sent me aid more than once when i was in need and the church at philippi they blessed paul's ministry they they provided the finances he needed to help carry on the ministry and the preaching of the gospel and as a church today as you and i are tithers and we're giving in the miracle offering i want you to know we're positioning our indianapolis church that we can be in a position when god opens the door for a building or land to get that building or land in a prime location for one sole purpose to see more change lives we're going to be giving today and we're going to help missionaries around the world and the children in haiti that are orphans with an education and we're helping the broken and the hurting we're starting other churches around america and the world that's what our generosity does it sees more change lives in verse 17 it says not that i desire your gifts i love this church i want this to sink into your heart what i desire paul says is that more be credited to your account i think sometimes we live so much for earth that we forget that we store treasures in heaven and that as we give to advance god's kingdom that more is being credited to our account as we see lives changed and give generously more has been credited to our account in heaven in verse 18 says i have received full payment and have more than enough i am amply supplied now that i have received from epidides the gifts you sent they are a favorite offering an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to god now we're getting to verse 19. after all he said that then he says and my god will meet all your needs according to his riches of his glory in christ jesus church to philippi because you gave generously to help the gospel be priests and lives to be changed god is going to bless you and meet all of your needs according to his riches and glory in christ jesus why why why because you can never out give god never ever ever ever ever will you out give the lord an indie family today as we prepare all of our hearts to give generously to the lord and if you're a guest you please feel no obligation to give at all we're just so glad that you're here but i do want you to know that we're church of vision where church that's about reaching the hurting and the broken and the loss we're not just sitting still but we want to do all that god's called us to do to see many people not go to hell because we believe there's a real hell and it's been eternity in heaven and we're going to pray and we're going to serve and we're going to give and we're going to invite we're going to share our faith we're going to be the light of the world because people's eternities hang in the balance and my wife and i we're giving our largest offering ever above our tithe to the miracle offering and here's why we deeply believe that more people need to experience the hope of jesus christ and we because we've given so much to the lord we trust him that not only is he going to meet all of our needs according to his riches and glories he's going to meet all of his churches needs according to his riches and glory so more lives can be changed can we welcome our lead pastor to the stage i'm going to allow pastor chris to come and pastor all of our hearts as we prepare to give to the lord today amen come on can we thank pastor herbert for that word he's a mighty god he's a mighty god and he's mighty to provide and i'm believing through this miracle offering god's to provide as you give he's going to provide for your life and as you give he's going to provide for our church we currently lease this building we look forward to the land and building god's going to give us next year to see more changed lives we do have new giving envelopes want to make you aware of that if you haven't got a chance to look at it yet you can open it up and see on the top flap there's just a way there if you want to set up reoccurring giving this is purely to serve you if you want to take advantage of that but on the bottom half there's a spot for miracle offering and so if you came prepared today to give by cash or check or you can still give with your card as well through this envelope but you can mark what you're giving to the miracle offering right there and so i just want to make you aware of this new offering just to hopefully that it will be a new offering envelope that hopefully it will better serve you as you give today and jamie and i we're just we're so thankful for pastor herbert and tiffany i know that we've always tithed and we've always given above the tithe but god has just used them to speak into our hearts about just being more generous than we've ever been before and this morning we gave to the miracle offering we gave the largest offering we've ever given before in our lives it's one that we've prayed and dreamed about and we're trusting god and he's faithful and we gave as well on the people's church app that is the easiest and best way to give and so if you want to give through the people's church app you can or there's a qr code if you want to scan the code or you can do it online or again you can use the envelope if you didn't come prepared to give today you can even take the envelope home and give and you can stick it in the mail and you can give that way as well but we're just going to go ahead right now and we're just going to pray over this miracle offering the ushers to go ahead and make their way forward and let's just go ahead and let's bow our eyes and would you just pray with me today over this offering father god we come before you right now with this miracle offering god asking you to do a miracle we thank you that you're a mighty god father god that you can do more than we could ever ask or imagine father god and as people step out in faith and as they give to the miracle offering father god lord i pray that you would bless their life and that their faith would be strengthened father god lord i thank you that you're going to use this miracle offering to see more changed lives to get us a new building or land to continue to support all of our missionaries to continue to support orphans in haiti and continue to support all of our strategic partners father god that are ministering to the hurting and the lost and the broken both here locally and nationally and internationally father god and so we give to you today we give to see more changed lives father god we give so that more people would come to know you and your love and we just thank you for all that you're going to do through the miracle offering and bless all those that give to it today in jesus name we pray amen

win the battle against the devil and demons and today I want to I want to educate you can can I take you a little deeper to today is that okay can I take you a little deeper I I I want to lay a theological Foundation about the devil and demons that the next three weeks are going to be a lot more practical but today I want to answer some of the most frequently asked questions about the devil and demons I want you to be informed not fearful equipped not unprepared and so here's the first question where did the devil come from the devil was once a Heavenly Angel created by God before creation along with all the other Angels Colossians 1:16 the Bible says all things were created things in heaven and on Earth visible and invisible whether throne or powers or rulers or authorities all things have be have been created through him and for him God created all things in heaven on Earth the visible and the invisible world when it says Thrones Powers rulers and authorities that's frequently used to describe Spiritual Beings so God created Angels God created the Unseen World and in Genesis 131 it says that all that God made was very good so we know that the devil was created good because everything that God made was good but like you and I the devil and the angels had free will they could choose to worship God or not to worship God Lucifer Who We Now call Satan chose not to worship God here's the second question what role did the devil have In Heaven There are some Scholars who believe Satan was created as a cherubim Angel and some who believe he was a seraphim Angel we talked about these two types of angels in week two of the the series if you missed it you can go on our you YouTube page People's Church Indianapolis and you you can find that message but here's why some scholars believe Satan was a cherubim angel in Ezekiel 28 the prophet began to pronounce judgment on a human ruler called The Prince of Ty a Phoenician ruler in the city of Ty now scholars believe Ezekiel was looking past the prince of Ty to the power behind the power Satan was the power behind that King's power he's the power behind the throne and whenever we see people leaders Nations doing evil and wickedness we always know that there's a power behind the power and that's Satan and so Ezekiel was pointing to the power behind the power I want to give you five insights of why Scholars believed Satan was a cherub angel in heaven first is this the phrase you were created instead of conceived look at Ezekiel 28:1 12-13 son of man take up layment concerning the king of Ty and say to him this is what the Sovereign Lord says you were the Seal of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty you were in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone adorned you Carnelian chrysite and emerald topaz onx and Jasper lapis lazuli turquoise and Barrel your settings and mountings were made of gold on the day you were cre ated they were prepared so scholars believe since it says you were created it's referring to when God created Satan because if it was a man it would have said the day you were conceived or the day that you were born here's a second insight and it's the phrase you were in Eden the Garden of God we know that there's no way that King was in the Garden of Eden but we know that Satan was there and he tempted Eve thirdly the reference to Satan having musical ability in verse 13 it gives a description of settings and mountings made of pure gold some versions of the Bible translate it as tabrets and pipes a tabret is a is a tambourine type instrument scholars believe this refers to Satan being very gifted musically he had pure gold pipes some even say he was the main worship leader in heaven the fourth Insight is the phrase you were the anointed cherub Ezekiel 28:14 you were anointed as a guardian cherub for so I ordained you you were on the holy Mount of God you walked among the fiery stones we know that the king of Ty was not a cherub Angel so this seems to be pointing to the power behind the power Satan and then the fifth Insight is the phrase you were perfect or blameless Ezekiel 28:15 you were perfect the NIV says blameless in your ways from the day you were created till iniquity was found in you we know that no human being being was perfect or blameless except for Jesus and when the first humans Adam and Eve sinned against God sin entered our world and every human being since then has been born into sin Romans 3:10 as it is written there is no one righteous not even one humans are born Sinners but Satan was created good perfect and blameless just like God created Adam and Eve per perfect and blameless but again Satan had free will just like we do and he chose to rebel against God he chose not to serve God just like you and I can choose not to serve and worship God now let me give you one reason some scholars believe that Satan was a seraphim Angel the word sarap means fiery serpent so in Genesis 3 one when the devil was tempting Eve he came as a serpent because that's what he was he was a seraphim Angel a serpent Angel a snake likee Angel and the Bible describes Satan as a snake in the Book of Revelation Revelation 12:9 the Great Dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan Revelation 12:15 then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent this is talking about the devil revelation 22 he seized the dragon the ancient serpent who is the devil or Satan and bound him for a thousand years now I'm not 100% sure the devil was a cherub or seraphim Angel but what I'm 100% sure is that the devil was created as a good Angel the third question is why is the devil no longer in heaven serving God one word describes why the devil is no longer in heaven serving God and worshiping God it's Pride 1 Timothy 3:6 he must not be a recent convert or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil the devil came under God's judgment because he became proud Ezekiel 28:1 15-17 says you were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you though your widespread trade you were filled through your widespread trade you were filled with violence and you sin so I drove you in disgrace from the Mount of God and I expelled you Guardian cherub from among the Fier Stones your heart became proud on account of your beauty and you corrupted your wisdom because of your Splendor so I threw you to the earth I made a spectacle of you before Kings Satan became proud because of his Beauty his gifts his talents his position and power Church be very careful because it's easy for all of us to allow Pride to creep into our heart watch out for Pride because it will distance you from God God opposes the proud let's quickly look at what Isaiah says about Satan's pride and downfall scholars believe that Isaiah 14 does something similar to what Ezekiel does in chapter 28 he begins to pronounce judgment on the king of Babylon and as he's pronouncing judgment he starts talking about the power behind the throne he looks to the power behind the power Satan Isaiah 14:1 12-14 how you have fallen from Heaven Morning Star son of the Dawn some translations say Day star shining star says morning star in the King James the new King James and and that's transl Morning Star there is translated as Lucifer you have been cast down to the Earth you who once laid low the Nations you said in your heart I will Ascend to the heavens I will raise my throne above the stars of God I will sit enthroned on the Mount of assembly and the utmost Heights of Mount Zon I will Ascend above the tops of the clouds I will make myself like the most high Satan saw his Beauty and his gifts and instead of worshiping The Gift Giver he worshiped the gift he wasn't satisfied with the power God had given him he wanted more power so he said I will raise my throne above God's Throne he wanted the same power that God had he wanted to be in charge he wanted to be worshiped and the devil became so full of Pride that he had the audacity to try to fight against God that's some serious Pride when when you think you can fight and win against God of course Satan's plan did not work he was light work for God matter of fact God didn't even get involved in this battle he let his angels take care of his light work Revelation 12: 7-9 then war broke out in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back but he was was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven the Great Dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan who leads the whole world astray he was hurled to the Earth and his angels with him Isaiah 14:15 also talks about Satan getting kicked out of heaven is Ezekiel 28:17 talks about Satan getting kicked out of heaven Jesus talked about Satan getting kicked out of heaven Luke 10:18 he replied I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven Satan's Pride got him kicked out of heaven here's the next question is the devil omnipresent and the answer is no the devil can't be in more than one place at the same time only God God is omnipresent the de the devil was a created angel he is limited by space job 1:7 the Lord said to Satan where have you come from Satan answered the Lord from roaming throughout the earth going back and forth on it Satan has to roam from place to place because he can't be in more than one place at a time he is not omnipresent there's another question number five where do demons come from most scholars believe demons were once angels in heaven they were created before creation along with all the other Angels these Angels were once in heaven serving God but Satan convinced them to follow him and rebel against God so when this war broke out in heaven Not only was the devil kicked out of heaven but so were the angels that chose to follow him and rebel against God Revelation 12:4 its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the Earth many scholars believe the third of the Stars here is referring to the angels who were thrown out of Heaven onto the Earth Revelation 129 n it says the Great Dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan who leads the whole world astray he was hurled to the Earth and his angels with him so many scholars believe demons are angels who were kicked out of heaven and thrown to Earth another theory that's not nearly as common on where demons come from and that's not supported as clear clearly in scriptures is that demons are the disembodied spirits of the Dead Nephilim the Nephilim were The Offspring of the sons of God or Angels who had sex with women Genesis 6:4 in those days and for some time after giant nephilites lived on the earth for whenever the sons of God God angels had intercourse with women they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous Warriors of ancient times so the Nephilim were The Offspring of the Angels who had sex with human women and some believe when the Nephilim died their Spirits became demons now I don't personally believe this I believe demons are fallen angels who were kicked out of heaven number six sixth question who are the Angels or or yeah who are the Angels bound until who are the angels that are bound until judgment forgive me there isn't 100% Clarity on who these angels are but there are Scholars who believe these angels are the ones who had sex with the human women in Genesis 6 so God was very displeased with these rebellious angels for having sex with human women and bound them in Chains so that this would never happen again second Peter 2:4 it says for if God did not spare Angels when they sinned but sent them to Hell putting them in Chains of Darkness to beh held for judgment and so we know that the devil's sin in heaven did get him bound with chains so it seems to be another sin that Angels committed there's another sin that Angels committed that got them Bound in Chains and I believe it's the sin of Genesis 6 when the Angels had sex with human women Jude also talks about these angels being Chained and in Jude Jude it says and the angels who did not keep their positions of a Authority but abandoned their proper dwelling these he has kept in darkness bound with Everlasting chains for judgment on the great day and so there are Fallen Angels who are bound until Judgment Day number seven the seventh question is this is there a hierarchy of demons because demons were once angels and we learned in week two of the series that good angels have a hierarchy and is no different with falling angels Fallen Angels demons have a hierarchy Ephesians 6:12 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities principalities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the Heavenly Realms Paul teaches us that the Demonic spirit world has rulers authorities powers and spiritual forces there's a hierarchy Daniel 10: 13 it says but for 21 days the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way then Michael one of the archangels came to help me and I left him there with the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia so this the the Prince of Persia was an evil spirit who had Authority and influence over the Persian Kingdom and so it's clear that the Bible is giving us Intel that some demons have authority over Nations countries states and cities the Demonic world is very organized question number eight can demons know things that people don't and do things that people can't first let me say that God is the only one who is all powerful and all knowing but demons do know things that we don't because they are because they are spirits they don't die so they've been around since before Adam and Eve were created thousands of years ago so Deon know more about heaven than we know because they lived in heaven they more know more about God than we know because they lived in heaven with God they know more about the Unseen World than we do because they operate in the Unseen World they know more about Earth and the seen world than we do because they've been observing the seen world for thousands of years they know a lot because they've been around for thousands of years let let me read a couple of passages of scriptures of how demons can know and do things that we can't acts 16: 16-17 it says once when we were going to the place of prayer we were met by a female slave who had a Spirit by which she predicted the future she earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune telling she followed PA and the rest of us shouting these men are Servants of the most high God who are telling you the way to be saved the demons knew who Jesus was because they used to be angels in heaven they've been around a long time and demons can do things that people can't look at Matthew chap 8: 31- 32 the demons beg Jesus if you drive us out send us into the bir of pigs he said to them go so they came out and went into the pigs and the whole herd rushed down the Steep Bank into the lake and died in the water demons can possess people's bodies and they can obviously also possess animals that's why your cats act so crazy we done figured it out you probably said the phrase my animal that my dog my kid acting like a demon what is going to me and as we talk about demons over the next several weeks I'm I'm going to teach you you don't want to miss it again I I would encourage you I I know today I'm I I know you I know I'm making some of your brains heard with some of the stuff I'm talking about but I want you to be educated all right in these next couple weeks we're going to I'm going to teach you about demon possession and oh Pro pression so I'd encourage you don't miss don't miss the final three weeks here's the last question question number nine can the devil and his angels repent the devil and his angels final fate is sealed they rebelled against God they've decide they've deceived the world they have killed stolen and destroyed so many people's lives so God created hell for the devil and his angels hell wasn't created for Humanity Matthew 25:41 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the Eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels hell wasn't created for you God doesn't want any human being to go to hell Hell is For The Devil his his fate is sealed God did not provide a Plan of Redemption for fallen angels like he did for mankind God the father he sent his one and only son Jesus Christ to die on the cross so that Humanity's sin can be forgiven but God did not provide a Plan of Salvation for the Fallen Angels Hebrews 2:16 it says for surely it is not Angels he helps but Abraham's descendants God doesn't help the fallen angels with a plan of Sal salvation He sent Jesus for my sins for your s sins and for the sins of every human being don't reject God's Wonderful Plan of Salvation and follow the devil to hell God has provided salvation for you through Jesus Christ but you have free will and you can choose to accept or reject God's Plan of Salvation
Kl4trl8tQpU,well today we are continuing our series Miracles nothing is too hard for God and the title of my message today is not what I thought I wanted not what I thought I wanted you know throughout this series we've already heard stories of God answering prayers and people experiencing Miracles but there may be some of you in here that are wondering why haven't you received your Miracle well in this series we have discovered that you have to ask James says you have not because you ask not in this series we've learned that you got to ask with faith we learned that in in in James when you ask ask have have faith a couple weeks ago I preached on eight ways to receive your miracle and yet you may be in here saying pastor I'm asking I'm asking in faith I followed all eight ways that we learned to pray two weeks ago and nothing's happened and so this week I want to talk to you about why God still hasn't answered your prayer and what to do about it and to answer these deep theological questions I'm going to show you a picture to help you understand these profound Mysteries now I could show you a diagram of the holy of holies I could pull up the Greek definition of the word miracle and we could dissect it together but this pick I'm going to show you is about to give you a breakthrough show them broccoli yeah you're like broccoli why is there a picture of broccoli on the screen let me explain if I'm honest with you uh I don't like vegetables okay anybody out there with me anybody else don't like okay there's a few of you but I know you're supposed to eat vegetables right vegetables are good for you when you were a little kid like Cohen right now he would live off chocolate chips and Kit Kats uh all day long yesterday he was begging me to take him to Leo for a Kit Kat he hasn't had anything else to eat and I'm like no no you need to eat real food he's like well then I want chocolate chips and so pray for us as we are trying to help him have a balanced diet but uh I remember as you know as a kid you need to eat your vegetables that make you healthy and strong I hated vegetables my my mom when we were little she used to make us the uh uh you know the frozen vegetables the assorted pack where it's got like little peas and carrots and little pieces of corn and lima beans who needs a limma bean like for real the liab beans were disgusting and I did not like the vegetables and so what I would do is I would have a napkin and when my mom wasn't looking I'd put a scoop of vegetables in the napkin and then I act like I'm eating it and then when she would look I put another scoop and I'd keep doing that till I had a napkin full of vegetables and I put it in my pocket put it in my pocket thank you Mom for dinner and oh I need to go to the bathroom then I'd go to the bathroom and I would dump all the vegetables in the toilet and I would flush them down the toilet cuz if you put them in the trash can you have evidence all right children do not take any of these uh things I'm giving you right now and put them into practice okay but I hated vegetables and the vegetable I hated the most broccoli oh oh it man it stinks when you cook it I like I I would gag like I would have to eat the my mom be like you better eat that broccoli pinch your nose how many you know pinching a nose doesn't help you know what I mean I be pinching my nose you know trying to eat the bro hate Brock any any people out there hate broccoli any anybody out there how many y'all love broccoli man first service too my wife and CH they love broccoli they call it trees you can have your trees I broccoli and cauliflower can't do it can't do it okay so I I dislike broccoli I it's it's my least favorite vegetable out of all of them okay now I don't like vegetables but I like salad I I do like salad I like lettuce and tomatoes and I like cold vegetable put smother it in ranch you know what I mean like I like I like a good salad okay and jam Jamie often times with dinner we may have like a protein like we may have grilled chicken and she'll make a salad and Jamie makes some delicious salad she'll make a Caesar salad uh she'll make a little southwest salad it'll have some sliced like avocado on it with some black beans and corn and Little Tortilla strips and she makes a little barbecue Ranch drizzle on it delicious so I get excited when J whenever we're like we're having you know grilled chicken and salad I'm I'm excited for dinner and so there was one night I was asking what we're having for dinner and she's like yeah we have we're having grilled chicken and salad I'm like I'm excited I'm looking forward to dinner I sit at the table Jamie brings over a salad and it is broccoli there is broccoli and more broccoli she's like it's broccoli salad I'm like okay I like salad but I don't like broccoli and Jamie's like Chris Trust me you'll like this she was like I put bacon in it I'm like why'd you do that to the bacon I would have eaten the bacon all by [Music] itself she's like trust me just take a bite okay so I didn't pinch my nose but I took a bite of the broccoli salad and it was delicious oh oh that is now my favorite salad when we go to a cookout and she makes some broccoli salad I'm like you left some for us at home right cuz I know what y'all going to do y'all all going to eat that broccoli salad I want some so she'll put some aside just for us I love bro I like it as leftovers it is delicious it's broccoli now it's cold cold broccoli with some bacon and some cranberries and she got some other little like little dressing she tosses it in delicious it when I sat down to dinner that was not what I wanted but then I had it and realized oh my gosh that is now my favorite salad it was the best thing ever it's not what I wanted but I discovered it was so much better and I share that story because it provides context for my title not what I thought I wanted see some of you been praying for a new job praying for a relationship ship praying for a healing in your body and up until this point you haven't received your miracle and when you're hearing these sermons on faith and prayer and how to ask God and you're doing everything you know to do but you aren't seeing any changes it can be confusing and if we're not careful you can begin to give into the temptation to think that God doesn't answer prayer or at least he doesn't answer yours you might be thinking maybe maybe I'm not spiritual enough maybe God is mad at me because of my past sins maybe I'm not doing it right but before you lose hope I want to take you to a passage of scripture that will help you we're going to look at Second Corinthians 12: 8-10 and this passage captures a very insightful window into the life of Paul the Apostle Paul if you aren't familiar with the Apostle Paul he is a spiritual giant he wrote half the books of the New Testament he he was the original Chuck Norris come on youall remember them Chuck Norris stories and onliners Chuck Norris is so tough that when he does push-ups he isn't going up the Earth is going down you you know well let me tell you about Paul Paul was so tough he could rub two ice cubes together and start a fire he could cut through a knife with hot butter he was so tough ghost used to sit around the campfire and tell Apostle Paul stories Paul was a bad man I mean he survived a shipwreck he was stoned dragged out of a city just to only get up and go back in to that City he was bitten by a snake and just shook it off God used him mightily he was a spiritual Giant Paul saw all kinds of Miracles miracles in his life and he saw God do all sorts of Miracles through his prayers and his ministry but when we get to 2 Corinthians 12 we see that Paul has a problem he calls it his Thorn In the Flesh come on you ever said to somebody they being a thorn in your side yeah yeah it's from the Bible it's from the Bible it's where we get that phrase and we still use it today and we don't know exactly what it was most Scholars believes it believe it was some sort of physical ailment but what we know is that it was something that caused Paul extreme pain and distress look at what it says in 2 Corinthians chap 12:8 three different times I begged the Lord to take it away Paul was pleading with God he was suffering so much that he was begging God to take the pain away not just once not just twice he was repeatedly asking God for help he needed a miracle and he knew that God could do it but look at how God answered Paul 2 Corinthians 12:9 each time he he said my grace is all you need my power works best in weakness let me translate that for you God said no my grace is all you need my power works best in weakness I have to admit as much as I hate it for Paul I sure do like the fact that I know this part of his story makes me feel better about my you and I don't have to feel like something is wrong just because we haven't received our Miracle yet Paul was learning something through this that became more valuable than the healing he thought he wanted look at 2 Corinthians 12 verse 9 and 10 it goes on it says so now I'm glad to boast about my weaknesses so that the power of Christ can work through me that that's why I take pleasure in my weaknesses and in insults hardships persecutions and troubles that I suffer for Christ for when I am weak then I am strong Paul didn't get mad he didn't get frustrated he didn't say this is not what I wanted this is not what I asked for oh I'm glad that he didn't give up and think oh well God doesn't do Miracles he doesn't answer prayers instead he said says this is not what I thought I wanted but upon further review although my Miracle looks different than what I asked for and different from even what I thought I wanted this is actually a bigger miracle and a better answer see upon First Sight you may not be convinced when I saw that broccoli I was like uhuh where's my napkin can I fool Jamie the way can I can I I do like I did in vegetables when I was little the initial disappointment and frustration over not getting what you want might take a minute but when you take a step back and zoom out I'm confident you'll begin to see your situation differently see sometimes you don't receive a miracle because you don't ask sometimes it's because you don't have faith sometimes it's because there is sin in your heart and sometimes is none of these things it's not a bad request or a wrong approach but like Paul it's simply because God has something better so what do you do you prayed for a loved one to be healed and they passed away you prayed for a promotion and someone else got it you prayed to get married and you can't even get a date maybe you need me to look at your online profile let me help you out there let me just you prayed to get pregnant and it hasn't happened must be real the Bible isn't intimidated by our questions we don't have to get discouraged feel defeated or lose hope let's run to the only place that has the real answers and that is God and his word word and so I want to give you three things to do three things to do when you haven't received your Miracle yet or maybe God says no number one trust him trust him Proverbs 3:5 and 6 trust in the Lord with all your heart that's in the good times and the bad times that's when God says yes and when When God says no that's even when God doesn't say anything at all or God says wait trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways submit to him and he will make your path straight he may not do it the way you wanted him to or thought he would do but his word says he will make your paths straight you can trust him when you can't trace him he's never failed and he's not starting now trust him and listen don't don't go by what you see you can't lean on your own understanding you got to keep walking keep trusting look what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5: 6-7 it says so we are always of good courage we know that while we're at home in the body we are away for the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight and you got to trust him by faith if your faith is weak you got to strengthen your faith by staying anchored in his word see if you don't know Paul's story so he had this thorn in his flesh and God said no he said my my grace is all you need my power is made perfect in your weakness but if you don't know his story Paul also ended up in jail Paul was ready to take the gospel around the world he was going from place to place and then all of a sudden he got arrested and put in jail and I'm sure he thought oh this is just a short term you know what I mean hey hey go get my bail you know I'm sure he thought okay maybe I'll be here a week then it's three weeks then it's a month okay well hey yeah great God I know I'm gonna get out of here at some point he didn't he stayed in prison he stay I guarantee you that was not what he wanted I guarantee you he wasn't praying Lord he put me I he was probably Playing Lord get me out of this prison so but you know what in he got locked up in prison he knew his calling and what God wanted him to do you know what he kept doing he kept trusting God he kept trusting God see I told you how Paul wrote half of the New Testament four of those books four of those books Ephesians Philippians Colossians and phiman were written from prison Paul didn't stop trusting God he stayed on Mission even locked up in a prison he started writing letters he started writing books of the Bible and to this day those books are still seeing people's lives changed and transforming people I'm sure it's not what he wanted I'm sure it didn't worked out the way he would have planted it but I guarantee if you go to Paul and say would you have given up prison to not have the worldwide thousands upon thousands of years influence Paul would say I go to prison all over again to write those books to write to those churches to see that today people are still being saved and changed by the word of God millions of people they don't never see until they go to heaven he kept trusting he kept trusting he kept trusting he kept trusting guarantee prison was not what he wanted but the kingdom impact he had and is still having today is a miracle I bet he could have never imagined far greater than the miracle of get me out of this prison so trust him trust him trust him number two don't miss all the Little Miracles while waiting on your big one it's easy to miss all the Little Miracles while we're waiting for the big one think about the Israelites they're in captive they're slaves in Egypt God sets them free leads them out I mean split the Red Sea they're walking on dry land with walls of water they get through and then they're like we hungry makes Mana from Heaven just rain down some french bread you just raining down pancakes and French toast you know what I mean just like raining it down well then they got thirsty provided water out of a rock I mean all these Miracles And yet when you read about these people they're like Where's God we're all we bit better back in Egypt where are you Lord like what do you mean where are you Lord but they were so focused on the Big Miracle they were still expecting and wanting they they forgot about the and they weren't that little let's be honest you know what I mean but they forgot about the amazing things that God already did let's not lose sight of how God is moving in our lives right now how he has already come through time and time again how he's with you right now don't miss it his grace is sufficient right here right now his strength is perfect complete sufficient even when you feel weakest he's close he's strong come on let's be real it's a miracle you are sitting in the seat you are sitting in there is a day and time at 11:45 on a Sunday you were still holding on to that pillow or those sheets or you were having some mimosas over for a little brunch oh there was a day and a time you wouldn't have been caught dead in a church and here you are you're a seated Miracle right here in this building come on you drove here in a miracle if you walk that's okay you walked on your two legs and it's a miracle there's someone next to you you know they're a miracle there's a miracle there's food in your fridge clothes in your closet the check passed the the paycheck hits your bank account every day there are Little Miracles all around all around don't allow the one thing you are waiting for take away from all the little things God is doing every single day and then number three keep praying and praising while he's working keep praying and praising while he's working Paul said this in Romans 8:28 and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose listen I don't mean to trivialize your pain with a silly story about broccoli but I do want you to know that when you're walking with God honoring his word trusting and believing for a miracle and the answer looks different than what you expected I can guarantee you when it's all said and done you will look back and realize that what he gave you is far better than what you wanted come on he's working while you're waiting keep praising keep believing keep trusting come on thank him for the Miracles that are already happening thank him for the fact that he knows better than you do he knows what will bless you best his gifts are the best gifts even when they come in rapping we don't initially like or understand his timing is perfect he's never failed and he won't start now he's too good not to believe and there have been instances in my life where there's something I wanted and realized that God didn't give it because he had something better that God said no or wait because he had something better I remember I wanted to I didn't want to go back to Bible College I went to Bible College in Springfield Missouri I didn't like it I wasn't enjoying it I wanted to stay back here in Indianapolis I could have taken Bible classes online and pleaded I beg God please don't make me go back to Missouri look it sounds like misery God I don't want like and I would get a bad attitude every time I cross that state line if you're from Missouri I'm sorry I love you okay you need to pray for me but I didn't know what was best for me but I I I I I didn't want to go back I pleaded I begged I cried and over and over again God was like no no no and you know God knew what I did and know I needed to finish up my degree there I needed the relationships that I was going to build there taking that path and going to Bible College it led me to where I am today and I would not trade it for the world I wouldn't trade it for the world I remember my freshman year there was a girl and I was like man I I want to I feel like maybe she's the one and I started praying and and she loved God we're talking about God every day and I'm like oh man Lord I I I really believe like we we we start dating we can get married and as I was praying the Holy Spirit was like no no no no no and I'm like man why God why I mean she loves Jesus you know what I mean I love Jesus we talk about God every day we both want to be in full-time Ministry like I remember being confused and kind of frustrated with God like what do you mean no God this is what I want what I didn't know is that during that time where she was doing all that talking she was with another man and pregnant with his baby come on and I wouldn't have married Jamie come on so listen and when I look back now oh I thought I knew what I wanted but I thank God he didn't give me what I wanted I thank God he didn't do the miracle I thought I needed because he had something far better oh saved the brother some heartache might have lost my mind instead I waited a little longer and found my true bride Jam am Lee oh baby [Music] you and listen he didn't make that one easy either the first time I asked her out she told me no oh I'm done with you I thought I had missed God God said wait I don't want to wait he said wait I don't want to wait rejected me there's all kinds of girls they would love to be with me God this is what I was thinking and I prayed I prayed about asking her out she told me no God said wait after a year she finally came to her senses praise the Lord but I could have walked away I could I didn't get what I want and you just got to trust him he knows better his timing is perfect you got to trust him you got to follow him you got to listen and I listen I know it's not easy I know there's some dire situations and I have just learned from my life over and over again God I don't get it I don't understand it I don't even enjoy what I'm going through right now but I'm going to trust you I'mma trust you I'mma trust you you've never failed me yet and you're never going to fail me he doesn't fail you got to trust him you got to trust trust him keep praying and praising while he is working if you haven't received your Miracle don't push God away press in to God get closer to clearly hear his voice and follow him he loves you he has better for you he knows better than you and he is working all things he's working all things for your good keep trusting keep praying keep pursuing keep leaving if I could have the keys come out listen I just want to encourage you and I know there's so many different situations and I know some of them are painful painful I know when it took us four years to get pregnant those years were painful every month all the negative pregnancy tests the questions the wondering we are praying we are fasting you got people around around us getting pregnant like every time they take a sip out of the water fountain I go let me go get a sip of that too four years it was hard man maybe we got to go get some stuff checked out I mean I just I just remember the wrestle and I remember this because it's always funny right be careful what you ask God for I remember when we first decided we were going to get pregnant we said God we want your timing don't pray that pray unless you mean it four years was not my time you know I thought like hey a year you know what I mean we know you know and but it it was tough it was tough it was tough it was so so tough but we finally got pregnant with our third child Cohen and you know what I look back on it now and and in that four years that was when we were starting the church I don't know if we would been able to do both like I look back now we were able to successfully plant a church because not all Church plants are successful statistics back 80% of them fail we're able to have that and we were able to have a child and yet I don't have all the rhyme and reason I just know time and time again God's proved himself to be true and yet there are still some prayers I've been praying for over four years there's some I've been praying for 10 years and I'm not going to give up I'm going keep praying I'm going keep trusting I'm going keep believing he knows I don't but he knows trust him with all your heart

Mkps1yB2Vtc,"well today we are continuing our series called more everybody say more more the title of my message today is living God's way last Sunday we talked about Ephesians 3:20 and how God is the god of more he wants to do more than we can ask or think God has more for your life he has more for your marriage and relationship more for your finances and career more for your children and your friendships more for your relationship with God and God not only has more for your life but God has more for our church and we're in this season of stepping into the more that God has for us and if you missed last Sunday let me catch you up on what God is up to at People's Church last Sunday we we showed a video we're not going to show that whole video we've we we've edited it down but it's still going to give you a good picture of what God is doing and I would encourage you to go to peoples. church more so you can watch the video in its entirety but watch this video and see what God is doing at People's Church this is the most exciting season in the history of our church we are having record setting Sunday attendance and we're seeing thousands of people coming to faith in Christ every single year in 2023 we baptized 994 people in water it's amazing what God is doing in 2024 we're on Pace to see over 1,000 people water baptized that's unbelievable the majority of churches in the United States do not have the Evangelistic anointing and momentum that God has given us God has raised up People's Church to be a Soul winning Church a church on the front lines snatching people out of the grips of hell we are a unique Church where it's okay not to be okay and this is just the beginning we are just getting started God has so much more for us here at our Indianapolis campus we have been leasing 30,000 square ft of this building that's actually 58,000 total square fet in 2024 we got an incredible offer from the owner to purchase the entire facility along with the five acres it sits on for 3.2 million that's $55 per square foot which is well under market value we closed on the building on June 28th and now we have a cheaper payment than what we were paying to lease the building come on Andy Thank You Lord for your favor but we bought our first permanent home because God has called us to reach more people we can now expand this building with a brand new spacious Lobby approximately a 900 seat state-ofthe-art Auditorium more Prime parking spaces and expand the PC kids area to reach and disciple more kids for Jesus this project will cost approximately $3 million right now we have four Sunday services and we're seeing around a thousand people worshiping at our Indie campus on Sundays with the renovations of our first permitted home we can more than double our attendance and our impact this more spiritual journey campaign is not about a building it's about all the lives that will be changed through this building church family here is what I know from years of Walking with God in order to see more in our church it has to start with God doing more in each of us it has to begin with you and with me God always does more in and through his people that's why we're going on a spiritual journey called more the scripture that's on my heart on Pastor Chris's heart for our church is Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 20 now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us I believe God wants to do more through you through me me that's why I'm asking everyone who calls People's Church home to participate in this spiritual journey I call this a spiritual journey because it's truly going to deepen our faith our trust in God and our dependence on God as we all go on this journey God is going to speak to each of us about our part to help make the vision become reality you are a vital part of our church we're in everyone Church everyone does their part to see the vision become a reality no matter how long you've been attending our Indianapolis campus you are a vital part of our church People's Church isn't everyone Church everyone does their part to see the vision become a reality today I'm asking you pastors Chris and Jamie are asking you to decide to be a part of this spiritual journey so that together we can reach people who are not here yet that's who we are that's who we will always be it has always been and it will always be all about more changed lives amen God has more for our church we are in every one church and I want all of us on this journey together because God has more for your life everybody wants to experience the more that God has for their life the question I want to answer today is why are so many people not experiencing more let me look at a couple verses of scripture to understand why Romans 121 and2 it says therefore I urge you brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy and pleasing to God this is your true and proper worship do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transform formed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is his good pleasing and perfect will Paul says something that's very convicting he says after Christians put their faith in Christ we now must offer our bodies as a Living Sacrifice if you're really serious about following Jesus and being a disciple of Jesus you have to offer your body as a Living Sacrifice Paul isn't talking about just praying a Prayer of Salvation or just barely making it into heaven he's talking about how to experience the more that God has for your life Paul says that true and proper worship only happens by offering your body as a Living Sacrifice he says you will only be able to know God's good and perfect will by offering your body as a living s sacrifice the number one question people ask me as a pastor is what is God's will for my life should I take the job should I go to that college should I marry that person should I change careers should I real relocate what is God's will and you will only know God's good and perfect will by offering your body as a Living Sacrifice the reason that so many people will never live out the will of God and experience the more that God has for them is because it's hard to be a Living Sacrifice the problem with a Living Sacrifice is it's easy to climb off the altar people tell the Lord I want to do your will I will surrender my entire life to you imagine with me that this is an altar and people will say Lord okay I heard you Lord I'm done with dating I'm done with these girls I'm done chasing them God I hear you God my eyes are on you I'm not going to be looking at them anymore I'm not going to be talking to them I'm not going to be trying to get with them Lord I'm not getting any numbers no I'm off the market God I am just focused on who is that fine specimen oh baby hey girl hey girl and we climb off the altar we climb God I'm going to live pure and holy I'm going to save myself for marriage God I'm going to wait I'm going to save I'm going to I'm re I'm dedicating my Purity to you I'm I'm rededicating my Purity to you I'm I'm not going to have sex before marriage I'm not going to do it God I'm going to have to rout boundaries and the next thing you know we put ourselves in a compromising situation and we hit that that moment where the spirit's telling me no but my body my body and we jump off the altar y'all know what I'm talking about we say Lord I need you to help my marriage Lord help my marriage help my children Lord I'm putting it on the altar I'm putting it on the altar Lord I Trust You Lord will you hurry up Lord I don't know how much longer I can wait Lord my wife's driving me crave but my kids Lord please and we get impatient come on God and we're waiting but we don't want to wait anymore and we jump off the Altar and we start trying to control things ourself instead of just surrendering to God we say God I Surrender my money lord it's all yours you gave it all to me God whatever you want to do Lord just tell me God and I'll do it and then God speaks to you we act like we just didn't hear the Lord people stop experiencing more because they stop surrendering to God no matter how long you've been a Christian you can never stop being a Living Sacrifice you can never say I used to sacrifice and surrender everything to God the day you stop surrendering is the day you stop experiencing the more that God has for your life Jesus said it like this Luke 9: 23 and 24 then he said to them all whoever wants to be my de iple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me for whoever wants to save their life will lose it but whoever loses their life for me will save it a lot of Christians pray the Prayer of Salvation but they don't want to pick up their cross daily and die to themselves they don't really want to be a disciple that they don't want to be a living sacrifice and you can never experience the more that God has for your life unless you die to yourself and follow Jesus unless you surrender fully to God unless you become a Living Sacrifice you get on the Altar and you stay on the altar Luke 14:27 it says and whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple surrender never stop stops when you stop surrendering to God you stop experiencing the more that God has for your life I want to give you two components of a Living Sacrifice from the story of Abraham the first component is you must leave where you are you must leave where you are to experience more you always have to leave where you are so that you can go where God is wanting ing to take you look at Genesis 12:1 it says the Lord had said to Abram leave your native country your relatives and your father's family and go to the land that I will show you God told Abraham I have more for your life and your family but you have to leave where you are you can never go where God wants to take you if you're unwilling to leave where you are and listen leaving isn't always moving location often times leaving means leaving a habit or addiction leaving some friendships that don't honor God leaving a boyfriend or girlfriend that's pulling you away from Jesus leaving a secret sin or lifestyle leaving procrastination leaving fear and stepping out in faith leaving your comfort zone and getting committed to God committed to church committed to a small group Committed to serving on the dream Dream Team committed to honoring God with your finances often times leaving is not a location and Abraham experienced more because he was willing to leave where he was Genesis 12 verse 4-5 it says so Abram departed as the Lord had instructed one of the keys to leaving is being able to hear the voice of God experiencing more is on the other side of hearing the voice of God and being obedient to what he says next week I'm going to teach you how to hear the voice of God make sure you're here next Sunday it says so Abram departed as the Lord had instructed and lot went with him Abram was 75 years old when he left Heron he took his wife Sarah his nephew lot and all his wealth his livestock and all the people he had taken into his household at Heron and he headed for the land of Canaan and then the Bible says they arrived in Canaan he left where he was and he headed to Canaan but I have something that's very interesting about Abraham's father tra God calls himself the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but I don't think that was God's original intent I think it was supposed to be the god of Tia Abraham and Isaac I think God had so much more for tra I believe the original call to leave was given to Abraham's father let me show you this look at Genesis 11: 31- 32 it says one day Tia took his son Abram his daughter-in-law Sarai his son Abram's wife and his grandson lot his son Heron's child and moved away from ER of the calans he was headed for the land of Canaan but they stopped at at Heron and settled there tra lived for 205 years and died while still in Heron for some reason tra left his homeland of Earth the Bible doesn't say this but I believe he heard the voice of God I believe God called him to leave where he was so that he could go to where God wanted him to take him but tra ran into a problem that so many Christians run into to he got to a place in life where he was unwilling to leave he left once but he was unwilling to keep surrendering to God he was unwilling to pick up his cross daily and be a Living Sacrifice it says he was headed for Canaan but he stopped in Heron and never left I wonder how many of you have stopped in Heron God has so much more in your life but you've stopped an obstacle has stopped you a problem has stopped you the words of people have stopped you pain has stopped you fear has stopped you in the New Living Translation says they settled in Heron tra never made it to Canan because he settled some of you aren't experiencing more because you settled you've gotten comfortable inherent you have a comfortable job a comfortable lifestyle you're comfortable where you are in life you don't want to sacrifice you don't want to surrender it all to God and God is saying it's time to leave Heron God is saying I have more for you get out of your comfort zone God sent me to tell you don't stay comfortable in Heron don't stop and settle in Heron he has so much more for your life number two you will leave when you remember the promises of God in verse one God told Abraham to leave his country his relatives and his father's family that's not easy that's a pretty big ask from God God told Abraham to leave everything he has and everything he knows and in verse four Abraham surrendered to God and left but Abraham left because God didn't just give him a command he also gave him a prise promise actually God gave him one command and seven promises let's look at those promises in Genesis chap 12 verse 2 and 3 says I will make you into a great nation I will bless you and make you famous and you will be a blessing to others I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with content all the families on Earth will be blessed through you this is how God always works in our life he gives us one command to leave and then he has so many blessings on the other side of us leaving where we are but people get so focused on what they're leaving behind or giving up and they lose sight of all that they are gaining Abraham was gaining so much more than he was leaving behind God was going to make him a great nation literally millions and millions of people would be impacted if he was willing to leave God was going to bless him personally and all the families on the earth were going to be blessed by Abraham and all he had to do was leave where he was and follow God jimie and I have experienced this time and time again I experienced this when I left India and I went away to Bible College I left my family my friends all that I knew I went to a Bible College and I was nervous and I was scared but man God blessed me more than I could imagine we experienced this when we went to be youth pastors at People's Church we went and moved we were now 10 plus hours away from our family but we saw God bless us over and over and over again in 2014 God spoke to us to move back home to India we were leaving we were living in Oklahoma City leading very successful Ministries I had one of the largest youth groups in the state of Oklahoma we're seeing lives being changed and God told us to leave everything and move back to India see what most people know we didn't move back to Indianapolis to start a People's Church we just moved back to Indianapolis cuz God told us to come back to Indianapolis we moved back here in faith it was 5 months later that Pastor Herbert presented the opportunity about starting a People's Church in Indianapolis and when he did we sacrificed everything time Talent treasure to start this campus and we've done this on so many occasions since then and I'm so glad that we left because not only have we been blessed beyond measure but thousands upon thousands of lives have been changed and we still we leave where we are because we know our sacrifice always produces more changed lives it's all about more changed lives I want you to watch this video and see how God is changing lives I got married in 2016 about 2021 he put the gun up to my head and pulled a trigger I heard the loud click but nothing came out kept praying if I get him out of here God I'll never go back that's one of the moments that I thought I was far from God he wasn't here I didn't think he was going to ever come and save me I had a daughter that was still at home I woke her up and told her when I go to the porch we're gone just get in the car I was living in Sand Springs I had a big knife apartment working as a nurse at OSU and my mom had two strokes and I gave up everything to help her and found out about five days as we were at her house that she was getting evicted didn't know where she was going to go on top of that I was homeless myself because now she's homeless I found her place there and I just packed whatever I had left and came to at so I'm sleeping in my car I woke up one morning and I said I'm going to church but I asked God before I left I was just like God I don't know nothing here I don't know anyone where do I where do you want me to go so it's 15th Street People's Church and the campus is Edmond C this guy was out there waving I mean he was really really waving even when I passed him he was look in your rear mirror he was still waving at me I can't even explain it but it was like it was a light out there giving me some type of Hope and I'm like it got to be it that's got to be where I need to be so I did a u-turn it was amazing I mean everybody was friendly I fell right at home I said I got to come back I'm searching for something and I know know it's got to be here so when I came back that newcomer lunch was the best day I met my friend Stephanie and her husband Mr Brandon and her kids they're amazing they really are cuz I was here by myself I didn't have nobody when I met them they prayed for me they treated me like family cuz I didn't have no family I think they gave me life made me believe again so growth trap started now that was exciting I found that my purpose and a little bit of what God called me here to do and now I serve as a greeter over the coffee take pride in that because that's how I got here that smiling face so if I can be a blessing to someone else and help them along the way to get to where I'm at today yeah I know God is love and I think that he was just showing me that no matter what I've been through he was going to give me what I was missing and he did everything he said he was going to do and he's still doing it to this day I'm not homeless I have a good job I feel hope feel like I'm going somewhere now and it's not just the dead end I was lost that morning didn't care where I ended up at but that guy I mean he was like he was honored to be out there to wave with us if it wasn't for him out there I think I would have missed all the blessings that have today if I wouldn't have turned around I thank God for People's Church I really do amen here's what I know leaving where we are always changes lives it always blesses others yes it blesses our lives but the biggest blessing of leaving where you are is all the lives that are changed because you were willing to be a Living Sacrifice because you are willing to surrender to God time and time again and some of you were thinking this is a big moment Pastor God is asking me to leave so much he's asking me to leave some friends some relationships some things and some places I'm very comfortable with he's asking me to tithe he's asking me to make the largest three-year Financial commitment to the spiritual journey to renovate our first permanent home Pastor it scares me to do what God is asking me to do it's overwhelming and listen I want you to know Peter felt just like you do look at Matthew 10:28 it says then Peter spoke up we have left everything to follow you Jesus this is so hard we have left everything for you we've surrendered all to you we are a living sacrifice for you mark 10:29 and 30 truly I tell you Jesus replied no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age homes brothers sisters mothers children and Fields along with persecutions and in the age to come eternal life listen there's always p persecution that comes with progress but the blessings always outweigh the burdens you will never give up more than God gives back to you but you have to leave where you are as in everyone church I'm asking all of us to leave where we are by being committed to four things I'm asking everyone to be committed number one everyone committed to attending four Sundays in a

continuing our series called till he appeared and we looked at a verse in isaiah that gives some names of what appeared when jesus appeared and last week pastor herbert talked about one of those names that that when jesus appeared a mighty god appeared that he's mighty to say mighty to he almighty to set free and mighty to provide and this week we're going to look at that verse again isaiah chapter 9 6 and we're going to focus on another name but i want to share that verse with you isaiah 9 6 it says for to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace and today we're going to focus on jesus being our wonderful counselor our wonderful counsel i'm curious has anybody in the room ever been given good counsel has anybody been given some good advice all right has anybody in the room ever been given some bad counsel anybody ever been given some bad advice

counsel that i thought was a bit head scratching check out this first picture here this is a a box of fruit loops cereal and if you look at the very bottom of the paragraph it says wash thoroughly before use um just does anybody else wash their froot loops i've never washed my i mean i wash them with milk you know what i mean i wash them down with some milk but if you don't know that i guess you better start washing your froot loops i thought that was a head scratcher how about check out this next one caution please be aware that the balcony is not on ground level there were obviously some folks didn't realize that and they thought well we better we better give some good counsel because not everybody realizes the balcony is not on the ground level ch check out this next one oh the ipod shuffle everybody anybody on the shuffle everybody remember shuffle back in the day had a little shuffle i want you to focus on number two there do not eat the ipod shuffle some blessed soul

that'll help me sing good you know what i mean they're like but before they ate it you know they're singing they're like you know but then all of a sudden they ate the ipod shuffle and they're like i

is not the way to do it can you imagine they must have propped it up and figure well hey i'll just have my hair dry while i'm sleeping that is not a good idea we all have received and given good counsel we all have received and given bad advice bad counsel some of us we received counsel saved our job maybe saved a relationship others of us we've received some counsel it caused us to lose our job hurt the relationship we all can relate to this and isaiah lists four names of jesus in the old testament 700 years before his birth and it was during the season there was a lot of turmoil and fear in the nation and one of those names is wonderful counselor these two english words wonderful counselor they come from two hebrew words hebrews was the primary language spoken and written in the old testament and wonderful in the hebrew it means beyond understanding too wonderful for words it's who jesus is what he does it's beyond under two wonderful for words and counselor means to advi his advice his counsel his guidance is too wonderful for words in other words one day a son will be born from god he'll be given to us god in the flesh he'll be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end he'll guide you care for you understand exactly what you're going through he'll listen to you advise you and he'll heal your deepest hurts that's what makes him a wonderful counselor i love the way jesus is described in hebrews chapter 4 verse 15 and 16. it says for we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are jesus he's the wonderful counselor he understands everything we're feeling everything that we've gone through yet he did not sin and in verse 16 it says let us then approach god's throne of grace with confidence so that we may have we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need the good news is there is one who understands our need and let's be honest there's a lot of need in our world there's a lot of need in our city and our families in our schools i'm sure every single one of us in our lives there are needs you may be in a significant time of need today and the good news is there is a wonderful counselor who can help and his name is jesus and so we're going to look at a story today in the bible how jesus the wonderful counselor can heal and meet your needs meet you in your time of need this story is found in matthew chapter 20 verse 29 through 34 and we find two men that are in need and the wonderful counselor he helped them in their time of need he he appeared and they took advantage of it they they took four steps and the wonderful counselor he healed them and listen he wants to do the same for you today and so i want to share these four steps because i believe they will lead to healing and they will lead to the wonderful counselor helping you the first step is this you have to cry out to the wonderful counselor let's look at the story matthew chapter 20 verse 29 it says as jesus and his disciples were leaving jericho a large crowd follow him everywhere jesus and his disciple went there were these massive crowds just wanting to get to jesus and hear from jesus his reputation preceded him everywhere he went and so they would go to him and in verse 30 so there's this massive crowd following jesus and in verse 30 it says two blind men were sitting by the roadside and when they heard that jesus was going by they shouted lord son of david have mercy on us two blind men were in need of a miracle and they heard that jesus was close by and they cried out to the wonderful counselor see if we look closely enough in this story we'll see that these two men represent you and me that these two men in need of a miracle is us anybody though are we talking about pastor i'm not blind listen you don't you don't have to be physically blind to know and have experienced situations that you can't see let me explain some of you in here you can't see how you're going to get out of debt some of you you can't see how the relationship is going to be restored you can't see how you're going to shake and overcome the addiction you can't see how you're going to be free you can't see how the pain is going to leave you can't see how god could ever forgive you can't see how god wants to use your story to make a difference you can't see how you're going to build that business or you can't see how in the world you're gonna get through college or you can't see how your marriage can get better how your child can be healed how your family can be saved and restored see we all have experienced blindness but look at what these men did verse 30. the two blind men were sitting by the roadside and when they heard that jesus was going by they shouted i want you to catch this they didn't allow what wasn't working to stop them from using what was working their ears were working and their mouth was working and so when they heard they shouted they cried out to jesus son of david have mercy listen no matter what situation you are in the wonderful counselor he is near and he will hear your cry you just have to cry for him to hear it and that's what these men did it wasn't polite it wasn't uh excuse me hey jesus we're over here pardon moi no no no no it was loud it was dusty there was a crowd they're sitting on the ground i'm sure dust is on their face and all of a sudden they hear jesus and they have been blind and listen all they knew is jesus heals listen there were no surgeons in that time there were no cornea transplants or no eye doctors they they knew jesus was there and he was it and he healed and so they cried out to him they took advantage of it the wonderful counselor was coming and they cried out son of david help us listen you got to cry out for healing cry out for peace cry out to jesus for favor cry out to jesus for comfort cry out to jesus for restoration cry out to jesus for the salvation of your love he hears you cry out to him for your marriage and your family and your children and your health and your finances listen jesus he hears your cry look what the bible says in psalm 34 verse 17 and 18 it says the righteous cry out and the lord hears them he delivers them from all their troubles the lord is close to the brokenhearted and save those who are crushed to spirit listen you got to cry out to him he hasn't forgotten about you oftentimes we forget about him and who he is that he's a healer a waymaker a miracle worker a promise keeper don't you forget who he is and you cry out and you call out to the lord for your situation because he's the wonderful counselor now listen when you start to cry out when you start to press in when you start to say okay i'm i'm gonna go after jesus i'm gonna get close to him i'ma cry out to the wonderful counsel or the the healer the waymaker listen when you start to do that listen you're gonna come up against some opposition see the two blind men they cried out to god and the bible says the crowd rebuked them but this is my second step second point today you have to ignore the counsel of the crowd ignore the counsel of the crowd look back at the story matthew 20 verse 31 that they cried out and it says the crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet but they shouted all the louder they ignored the crowd lord son of david have mercy on us you see when you get serious about jesus when you get a vision for who he is and what he wants to do in your life and you start crying out to him you will have some people that will try to give you poor counsel they'll rebuke you they'll tell you to be quiet they'll look at you like you're crazy don't leave jesus i mean they will and you got to ignore they'll be like why are you going to church church can't help you they'll be they'll look at you like you're serving at church you spend two to three hours at church man you think that's going to help your life oh you're going to fast what's fasting you're not going to eat for 21 days and you're going to go to 6 am prayer that's extreme um i don't know i don't know what's going on at your church i don't know what they doing over there talking about not eating fasting for 21 days and you're going to 6 a.m prayer like that's that's silly you started tithing and you gave in a miracle offering that's ridiculous you think that's going to help you with your finances what do you which what you got there oh oh you got a bible oh you're reading the bible okay hey man we still on for tuesday trivia night small group was a small group oh oh now you're too good huh oh you're reading your bible going to church serving you can't come to tuesday trivia night because you're in your smog i don't want to go to your small growing a small group is that's weird small girl like we were supposed to be boys or we're supposed to be girls like what are you talking about a small group what we mean we can't go to the club anymore i mean they will you listen you'll start trying to live holy and cry and live for god what do you mean we can't hook up anymore what do you mean we can't live together anymore like what are you talking about like i hold up like well what do you mean you can't go to the party anymore you're my drinking buddy i can't go drinking by myself what do you mean were you are you old church and holy you crying out to god or oh oh you're not going to get high any man you better stop that you better come on and let's light it up what are you you're going to you're going to christian marriage counseling oh please listen it's over look file the divorce papers start over listen she's no good for you he's no good for you that's not gonna help you just need to start a oh oh you trying to watch your language and quit cussing we'll see how long that works and you got some folks that will doubt you question you you got to ignore the counsel of the crowd i remember when i got saved and i told my friends i couldn't go partying anymore they were like what man stop it i'm like no for real and that some of them get mad at me some of them make fun of me i remember when i told my friends i was going to quit cussing and they just thought that was ridiculous they thought that was silly i remember after i got saved i made a commitment that i was going to save myself to tell marriage there were even some christian folks that are like listen you at least got to test drive the car before you drive it you better ignore the crowd ignore the council i remember sitting down with the financial advisor he saw how much i was given to the church like that's a lot you sure you want to be yes i am looks like i need a new financial advisor but you got to ignore the crowd you got to ignore the counsel of the crowd and you got to listen to the wonderful counselor paul says this about the wonderful counselor in philippians 1 6 being confident of this that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus god has begun a good work and he will finish it those men cried out to god and they say you need to be quiet they say whatever they cried out even louder they pressed past the crowd you let the naysayers and criticizers say what they want we look to jesus the wonderful counselor and we got to persist and persevere even under pressure you got to ignore the counsel of the crowd and then number three communicate your need to the wonderful counselor look at matthew 20 verse 32-33 jesus stopped and called them he said what do you want me to do for you he asked lord they answered we want our sight see these guys got right to the point jesus said what do you want i'm sure a lot of folks thought they would ask for money because they were on the road they were begging they were looking for alms they could have been like well i'm going to be blind my entire life so i might as well just ask for something else but no no they asked something very specific they said jesus i want to see i want you to open my eyes i want to see my family i want to see my kids i want to see my wife for the first time i want to see you jesus i want to see the crowds i want to see the sunset i want to see the oceans i want to see the waves open my eyes see for some of you today you simply need to ask god and be specific look matthew seven verse seven three listen there's no prayer that is too big for god ask him about everything the bible jesus said ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened for everyone who asks receives the one who seeks fine and the one who knocks the door will be opened tell jesus what you want him to do for you can you imagine going to the hospital you got a broken leg and like the bone is sticking out and the doctor walks in he's like what would you like me to do for you well you see last week i got this splinter in my finger could you see you know what happens sometimes we're afraid to ask god big prayers we think we're not worthy or we think that's just the way it is well i've just i've always been blind so let me let me ask for something else listen would you pray big bold and specific prayers sometimes we we just go through the motions lord bless me and that's a good prayer but how do you want god to bless you be specific god help me god use me help be specific about how you want him to help him be specific about how you want god to use you be specific he does not mind your specific big bold prayers he wants you to there is no prayer that is too big for god pray over it pray listen ask god to help you forgive that person and say their name don't just say god just help me to forgive get specific get specific about the person get specific about the situation come on get specific pray for god to bless your finances and your business god i want to be blessed so i can be a blessed pray over your unsaved family members pray for them by name pray for your children by name pray specifically over them and their situation pray specifically over your marriage and the situation pray specific prayers when you need healing what you need heal be specific we need to be specific when we pray because god cares jesus cares look at first peter 5 7 it says cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you all in the greek means all it means all it means everything big small everything in between cast it on god ask him because he cares for you literally because you are of great concern to him god says whatever is of concern to you is of concern to me because i love you it's your marriage your kids your finances your future your family your health if that's a great concern to you it is of great concern to me so we got to cry out to jesus we got to ignore the counsel of the crowd communicate your need be specific and lastly number four is follow the wonderful counselor follow the wonderful counselor look at matthew 20 verse 34. it said jesus had compassion on them and he touched their eyes and immediately they received their sight and followed him listen don't miss this we can get so caught up in the miracle that we miss two of the most important words in this scripture that after they were healed they followed him everyone say follow him he is the wonderful counselor he is not afraid to to put his compassionate touch on any area of your life he wants to bless you and to heal you and to help you but listen listen when he does it listen follow him follow him when i gave my life to jesus he saved me i was broken i was lost i was hurting in so many different ways and when i finally found that hope when i finally found jesus i made up my mind for good bad or ugly i'm following him i have found the way it is jesus and i'm following him on the good days i'm following him on the bad days i'm following and there were times where it was a challenge and a struggle and i said jesus i'm just following you he's the wonderful counselor he's a wonderful counselor but you know what i see happen so often it breaks my heart as a pastor as i see so many people they're desperate hurting need healing need hope need forgiveness need a breakthrough and they come to jesus they cry out they come to church they start to press in and then what i see happen so often is that after they receive the blessing the healing once things start to get a little better they stop following you they stop following you and then they end up again broken hurting lost with some it's even a vicious cycle they'll come back and things will start to be good and then they stop following it don't stop and some of you are here today and listen god's gonna touch you he's gonna heal you know how you keep that favor keep that blessing keep that protection it's following him it's not gonna be all perfect but follow him he's the wonderful counselor don't get distracted by the crowd don't get distracted by your own knowledge in your own head and get in your head and think okay now i'm good so now i'm just going to go and do my own thing no no no no you keep following jesus every day every morning every night every year every month until your last dying breath you follow him you follow him you follow the wonderful counselor because his to his counselors is too wonderful for words he's got you he'll lead you he'll guide you he'll carry you but you gotta follow him you gotta follow him you gotta follow him i can have everybody just stand if you all just stand just stand across the room and you'll just kind of close your eyes with me [Music] you know god started speaking to me about this story and we get to see how these two men that were blind called out when they heard jesus was near because they were blind and they wanted to be healed and god said this to me said chris think about the people that were there blind hopeless and they decided to just let jesus walk on by they decided to let their healing walk on by their hope walk on by their forgiveness see i can imagine it was uncomfortable for these two blind men to call out [Music] to shout even louder after the crowd rebuked them and i wonder about the people who missed out on the breakthrough because they didn't want to be uncomfortable i believe some of you in this room there's some things you can't see can't see how the healing is going to take place you could easily be like the blood we've always been blind it's just always going to be that way you could just be like it's always going to be that way the hurts always going to be there the pain the so it's going to be this way it's always going to be this way i don't want you know god wants to heal you he wants to do a great and mighty work but you got to cry out you got to be willing to get a little bit uncomfortable and so i'm asking you right now would you be willing to get a little uncomfortable would you be willing to cry out to god we're going to sing this song great are you great are you lord and i want you to know he is great to heal he is great to deliver he is great to answer any need any prayer anything that you're going through right now come on if you got some things you can't see right now and you need jesus to touch you the way he touches blind men would you just lift your hands right now to heaven would you get a little uncomfortable maybe you've never lifted your hands would you get a little uncomfortable and lift your hands to heaven as we sing this song come on worship is a way that we cry out worship is a cry to god it's singing out to god it's calling out to him as we sing this song come on would you sing and would you get a little uncomfortable and our great wonderful counselor he's gonna bring healing he's gonna bring hope he's going to bring breakthrough deliverance father god we're crying out we're crying out great are you lord great are you lord [Music] help us heal this see [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's is oh oh lift your voice [Music] father god i just pray for all my brothers and sisters god i thank you for healing i thank you for deliverance i thank you that you're helping people see i thank you that people's faith is being lifted and restored i pray that people are making a decision god we're gonna cry out god every day tomorrow morning when we wake up in our bedroom in our prayer closet god we're gonna cry out when we drive to work we're going to cry out when we pray over our kids we're going to cry out when we pray with our spouse we're going to cry out when we pray over the sick we're going to cry out when we pray over those that are lost and bound by addiction we're going to cry out god give us a spirit to get out of our comfort zone and say jesus wonderful counselor we need you we need you we need you we need you and father god i thank you i thank you for the work that you're doing i thank you i thank you father that you are the wonderful counselor we praise you lord

much thank so thankful for you honored to be preaching today thankful for the trust that Pastor Chris and Pastor Herbert having me the the preach God's word to you today so we're gonna Jump Right In as we continue our series called I wish I would have today I've titled the message this I wish I would have considered the cost of compromise I wish I would have considered the cost of compromise I heard a story one time of a highly skilled Carpenter who is just about to retire after a long dedicated career in building houses he was extremely famous for his extraordinary work and was considered to be a master at his craft at the very beginning of his career the carpenter joined a prominent contractor and promised him that every single house he built would be extremely detailed and with Excellence as if it were to be the most important project he had ever been given one day the carpenter went to his boss's office to inform him of his plans to retire after a very long and successful career the boss replied I'm very sorry to see that you are leaving our organization may I request you to be kind enough to do one last favor for me the carpenter replied please sir tell me what is it that I can do for you the boss replied just build me one more house and then you're free to go the carpenter wholeheartedly respected his boss and agreed he immediately began to work on the new house but unlike any other house he had built over the course of his career this time he did not use the full extent of his expertise with this final home he took every shortcut he knew to finish the project in record time because he wanted to begin his retirement as soon as possible and so he began to cut Corners he used inferior material and he hurried to get the task completed and within a matter of weeks the day finally came when the carpenter had completed the house when the carpenter called his employer and showed him the house the employer was absolutely delighted and grateful to the carpenter the employer said to the carpenter thank you so much for doing this one last personal favor for me and then the employer handed over the carpenter some papers and keys to the front door and said these are for you the house you just built is my parting gift to you for all your years of hard work and dedication the carpenter was astounded because he could not believe that the home he had just built was his own he thought to himself if I had known this then I would have put my very best effort into building this home but because the carpenter had compromised his convictions that had made him such a successful Builder because he had compromised his commitment to his employer It ultimately cost him in the end and as a result he would be the one to live in the only inferior home that he had ever built perhaps there are many of us here today who have not only compromised certain convictions or commitments in our lives but we have also we we also know what it's like to have to pay the cost that comes with the compromise some of us have learned the hard way that actions have consequences and that compromise always comes with a cost that if you and I are going to be real with each other today it's not worth paying yet unfortunately there are many Christians and followers of Jesus today who are compromising spiritual convictions biblical commitments in their lives they're compromising their commitment to God and their relationship with Jesus not realizing or intently thinking of what it will eventually end up costing them later on in life today I want to draw your attention to scripture in the Old Testament where we read about a man named Samson His Story begins in Judges chapter 13. you can follow along with me in Judges chapter 13 beginning at verse number two the Bible says a certain man of zorah named Manoa from the clan of the danites had a wife who was childless unable to give birth the angel of the Lord appeared to her and said you are Barren and childless but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son now see to it that you do not that you drink no wine or fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean you will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazarite dedicated to God from the womb he will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines so right away the Bible tells us that before Samson was even born God had already planned an extraordinary purpose for his life because Samson was anointed he was called and chosen by God to lead and deliver Israel from being ruled by their enemies the Philistines but how many of you know you're probably wondering why did God give all these requirements all these convictions to Samson and his parents because how many of you know whenever God calls you to make a difference he also calls you to be different you have to be different to make a difference you see early on in his life Samson honored his commitment to the Lord into convictions by which she was to live he didn't eat anything that was considered unclean by Jewish ceremonial law he didn't drink any alcohol or touch any grapes he never let a razor touch or shave his head and the Bible says that God in the beginning of Judges chapter 13 God begins to bless him as he grew as he grew it said the spirit of the Lord began to stir in Samson and that when the Holy Spirit would come upon him he was over empowered by the the Holy Spirit was Supernatural strength that God would use to win battle after Battle Victory after Victory against the philistine Philistine people but you see sadly those of us who know the story we know that over time Samson began to drift away from his commitment to God and he began to compromise his spiritual convictions and as a result because Samson compromised it cost him a lot of things in his life today we don't we simply just don't have enough time for me to read and break down all four chapters of Samson's stories and some of you are like thank God this is not going to be a long sermon you like my brother's about to preach Judges 13 all the way through 16. but what I do want to show you is just three three things from Samson's life that compromise will cost you and that you simply cannot afford to lose as a follower of Jesus so let me give you three things that compromise will cost you what we learn from Samson's life I'll give you an example from each chapter in his story here's the first thing we learn number one what compromise will cost us compromise will cost you your calling compromise will cost you your calling in Judges chapter 14 beginning at verse 1 the Bible says Samson went down the timna and saw there a young Philistine woman when he returned he said to his father and mother I have seen a Philistine woman in temna and she's good looking now go get her as my wife his father and mother replied isn't there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people they're like of all the options you got Samson you want to bring this one home all the people in Israel you picked the philistine must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife but Samson said to his father get her for me she's the right one for me now here's something we know that Samson didn't know y'all if Mama don't like her it ain't gonna work some of y'all learned that the hard way you see Samson get this Samson in Israelite had fallen in love he had allowed himself to fall in love with a Philistine woman the representative the leader of God's people falling in love with the Enemy and no matter how many times God showed Samson it wasn't going to work Samson still was trying to find a way to make it work somehow Sampson was trying to marry into something from which God had called him to be separate Samson was trying to conform to a culture that God had called him to confront he had been called by God to fight the Philistines not flirt with them you see honestly the problem was never that Samson forgot who he was called to fight against because you read Judges 13 all the way through 16. my brother fighting Wiggins Philistines four days he did not forget who his enemy was who God had called him to fight against the problem is that Samson forgot who God had called him to fight for you see God called he had Chosen and hand-picked Samson to be his deliverer to be his leader he had been called by God not only to defend Israel but to also deliver Israel from the oppression of the Philistines Samson did not forget who he was fighting against he forgot what God he had lost sight of what God had called him to do and took his eyes off what he was called to fight for and if we're being honest in 2023 it is not very hard for people to figure out what we are against as followers of Jesus but it's very easy for us to forget that we're not just fighting against something but that we are called to fight for something greater than what we're fighting against you see Samson had lost sight of his god-given purpose when we use that word calling it's another word for purpose you see we forget and lose sight of our purpose like Samson whenever we forget what we are living and fighting for as followers of Jesus the Bible says in second timoth chapter 1 verse 9 that God has saved us he called us to a holy life that word holy it means set apart to be different not because of anything we have done but according to his own purpose and Grace and this Grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time if you're here today and you're alive in breathing then that means God has a Divine Purpose for your life and that there is a calling on your life from God you are called to make a difference in your home at your school on your team and at your job my friend God did not just put you where you are today to make money God did not just put you where you are today to be successful and to achieve a bunch of accolades that won't mean anything when you cross over into eternity God did not just call it puts you where you are call you to be where you are just to get an education or an experience God has called you to be different so that you can make a difference my life verse is found in Ephesians chapter 4 verse one I love what Paul writes to the church in Ephesus he says as a prisoner for the Lord then I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received my friend don't get distracted in your life in the everyday moments don't give in to the pressure and don't play it safe and stay comfortable and don't try to fit in with everybody else don't compromise and lose sight of your calling but live a life that is worthy of the calling God has given you because God has called you to lead your family to love and know Jesus God has called you to reach and disciple your co-workers in your classmates whatever it is that you do wherever it is that God has you the gifts he's given you the passions he's given you he's done it with a purpose to win your classroom to win the locker room and to win your City to Jesus live worthy of your calling as a spouse live worthy of your calling as a parent live worthy of your calling as a leader in an artist live worthy of your calling as a follower of Jesus Christ my friend don't lose sight of your god-given calling don't let compromise cost you your calling but live and lead a life that is worthy of the calling God has given you compromise will cost you your calling number two compromise will cost you your credibility it'll cost you your credibility in Judges chapter 15 verse number 9 the Bible says the Philistines went up in Campton Judah spreading out near Lehigh the people of Judah asked why have you come to fight us they responded we have come to take Samson prisoner they answered to do to him as he did to us then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Edom where Samson was and they said to Samson don't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us what have you done to us he answered I merely did to them what they did to me they said to him we've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines Samson says swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves agreed they answered we will only tie you up and hand you over to them we will not kill you so they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock see because Samson had continued to compromise his convictions because he continued to compromise his commitment to God get watch this he lost credibility with the very people he was supposed to deliver from captivity see in my mind it makes sense why the Philistines don't like Samson in my mind it makes sense why a Colts fan does not like Tom Brady but could you imagine a Colts fan not liking Peyton Manning we built a statue outside the stadium for crying out loud here we see though that in judges 15 the people of Judah Sampson's own people wanted absolutely nothing to do with him because he had developed a poor reputation not only among his enemies but also among his own people that's why they decided to hand him over to their enemy because they didn't want to encounter any more trouble than what Samson had already caused and brought them you see when Samson continued to compromise he lost sight of maintaining his credibility to serve as God's representative for Israel you see Samson was not just a military leader Samson was supposed to be a spiritual leader for Israel he was called by God to be his representative to the people of Israel and surrounding Nations you see sometimes though as followers of Jesus if we aren't careful we can easily jeopardize our reputation and even lose our credibility as people of Faith as the Church of Jesus Christ whenever we compromise our relationship with God the Bible says in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 20. here's what Paul wrote he said we that's you and me we are a Christ ambassadors God is using us to speak to you in other words he's saying it's as if Jesus is speaking to you directly through us because we are his ambassadors we beg you as through Christ though Christ himself we're pleading with you receive the love he offers and be reconciled to God you see an ambassador with someone who was sent by A King by a president or by a ruler to rep represent a kingdom or a government in another territory and you see our credibility is so important as followers of Jesus because the Bible clearly says we are his ambassadors we are God's Representatives his kingdom here on this Earth but my friend if we compromise against our convictions as followers of Jesus then we misrepresent Christ and we lose our credibility with the very people that we are trying to lead to Jesus I heard a story about years ago during the time of Alexander the Great perhaps the greatest military strategist and conqueror in the history of time there's a story that he he couldn't sleep one night and so he decided to take a walk around the guard Duty and what you need to understand about Roman culture is that a guard was told if they ever felt asleep on their post it was punishable by death so you can imagine none of those brothers getting any sleep they're not going to be the one to fall asleep and not just lose their job but lose their life so what happens is the leader of the whole entire Roman Empire walked around that night because he couldn't sleep and he comes across a guard who thought to himself man if I fall asleep no one will ever know I'm exhausted and I need to get some rest Alexander the Great comes upon this this Soldier sleeping a story he goes on to say that he kicks the soldier over and when the soldier wakes up he startled and he looks up and sees the leader of the entire of the entire civilization of the world and he begins to tremble like you imagine I'd wet my pants too like oh Lord he knows within 24 hours he will not be on this Earth he looks up terrified to Alexander the Great and Alexander the Great looks at the soldier and said furiously Soldier what is your name the soldier was so terrified he didn't even respond because the question hadn't registered again Alexander the Great said soldier I said what is your name finally the young man whispered Alexander sir trembling in his voice Alexander the Great erupted because he thought maybe he heard the wrong name he looked at the soldier again and said tell me again one more time I will not ask you again what is your name the soldier looking up at Alexander the Great says my name is Alexander sir Alexander the Great looked at the soldier in history reports he said the immortal words then Soldier either change your conduct or change your name man I wonder how many of us today God is speaking to us saying if you claim to represent me if you claim to represent my kingdom there are some of us we either need to change our name or we need to change our conduct because we do not represent ourselves and our kingdom we represent a king who is greater and a kingdom that is not of this Earth and whenever there is a breakdown between what you say as a follower of Jesus and how you live as a follower of Jesus it will cost you your cred ability the Bible says in first John chapter 2 verse 6 those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did if we're going to represent Jesus and his kingdom to those around us we must model Our Lives after Jesus and follow his example in every aspect of our lives so remember the next time you go to the Post on social media you represent King Jesus when you go to send that text message In the Heat of the Moment you represent Jesus and his kingdom when you're serving on the Dream Team after the week that you've had you are Christ rep representative to the families and the people you are reaching because the moment that you say yes to Jesus you no longer represent your desires your preferences your ideas or your opinions you represent a kingdom that is not of this Earth even if it's something that you're doing in private that you think nobody sees whether good or bad you still represent Jesus to some one my friend do not compromise your relationship with God at the expense of your credibility that's the second thing that compromise will cost you is your credibility and then lastly number three compromise will cost you your closeness to God compromise will cost you your closeness to God the Bible says in Judges chapter 16 beginning at verse number 16. he's with us Samson is with a Philistine woman who is not his wife her name is Delilah and she has been tempting Samson trying to get him to compromise his commitment to God and tell her the secret of his strength so that she can then hand him over to the Philistines verse 16 says that was such nagging she prodded him day after day until finally he was sick to death of it so he told her everything no razor has ever been used on my head he said because I have been a Nazarite dedicated to God from my mother's womb if my head were shaved my strength would leave me and I would become as weak as any other man when Delilah saw that he had told her everything she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines come back once more he has told me everything so the rulers of the Philistines returned with silver in their hands and after putting him to sleep on her lap she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair and so begin to subdue him in his strength left him verse 20 then she called Samson the Philistines are upon you he awoke from his sleep and thought I'll go out as before and shake myself free I got out of it the first time I escaped the second time I was good enough to get out of the mess on my own the third time it won't be any different this time but it says he did not know that the Lord had left him you see the Bible tells us that the secret of Samson's strength it was in his relationship with God the most important thing that Samson failed to realize is the most important thing he gave to Israel the most important thing he gave to people it was not his superhuman strength it was not his military expertise it was not his leadership or his tactics or his strategy the most important thing that he had and what he gave was his relationship with God in chapter 16 we learned Samson continued to put himself in vulnerable situations with Delilah she kept pressing him to compromise and to share everything with her and on three different occasions Delilah blatantly attempted to seduce Samson so the Philistines could capture him he kept playing around not realizing he was the one being played around with the entire time the Bible says whenever Samson had compromised his Covenant with God for Delilah says she put him to sleep and when he woke up as strength had left him the Philistines came for him the fourth time he thought man I can break myself free like I've always done but he did not know the Lord left him he compromised his relationship with God and it cost him closeness with God you see what we need to understand is that Samson did not just wake up one day and completely flush his Covenant with God down the toilet it was Moment by moment day after day decision after decision watch this compromise after compromise before Samson was fully aware that he had drifted so far from God Samson did not suddenly lose proximity to the presence of God it was compromised after compromise that allowed him to drift from God and that's when he lost his strength this strength his strength was rooted in the proximity he had with God the Bible says in James chapter 1 when tempted no one should say God is tempting me for God cannot be tempted by evil nor does he tempt anyone but watch this here's what it says about Sin each person is tempted that's where it starts when they're dragged Away by what their desire evil own evil desire and enticed then after the desire has conceived it's acted upon it gives birth to sin and in sin when it's full grown it gives birth to death it reminds me of a couple years ago when our family went out west to see Arizona Utah and Nevada there was one day in the trip where I actually proposed to my wife and she said yes praise God for those of you who know like she's in Gross track right now teaching I promise I'm married she said yes but what's awesome is we the day after we got engaged we're on cloud nine man it's awesome we we take this trip in Arizona to ride these mules on the Grand Canyon which I'm like this is cool I've never done this before this is gonna be awesome all right so they give me this mule and I'm like trying to tell the guy like look I don't know how to drive this thing he's like no it's cool there's four things you need to know it'll do this it'll tell it to go left do this it'll go right go stop I'm like this is easy I got this he's like we're gonna give you the mule called Kobe and I'm like oh like Kobe he's like no Kobe I'm like okay whatever so we get on this mule and everything's good right but what I quickly realized is like my mule out of the whole entire group of like 20 people is like the problem child of the whole entire group and I'm like yes I would get this mule thanks Kolb um so what happens is it begins to like storm a little bit bit it's like thundering it's like sprinkling and y'all Kobe was like bro I don't know if you know this but I clocked out at three I don't have to listen to you anymore so Kobe begins to like keep going he's getting faster he's starting to mess with other mules around him and I'm like well you need to listen he's not listening to me I'm like go right he's going left I'm like stop he's going y'all he goes off the path he he's like bucking the mules behind me I'm like dear Lord he's trying to get me off of him I'm like holding on for dear life like Lord I won't let it go until you bless me right and so I'm on this meal it goes off the path and I'm thinking dear Lord I just got married or I just got engaged haven't even been engaged one day and I'm about to die because this dude is gonna go off the Grand Canyon he's like hurtling like these large trees lying on the ground and I'm like oh my goodness like if he smashes me against a tree my leg is broken I'll never walk again like what in the world so then the trainers come and they grab and they're like sir you need to calm down and I'm like really I'll gladly trade mules with you so then I'm like cool they the trainers the whatever they're called mule mule whatever they take control of him and I'm like great the experts got it y'all they could not control him he breaks loose from them and I go on my second adventure of the day five minutes go by finally catching the right sir would you like to keep writing or would you like to get off and I'm like before I could they finish the question I'm already like walking back to Camp I'm like nope thanks I'll walk back in the thunderstorm with all the mud all the poop everywhere I do not care no thanks I choose life and I tell that story because sin is so similar to that stupid mule that I wrote I thought I had control over it it started fun it was going to be a great time but then all of a sudden something I thought I had control over had control over me sin starts small like the Bible says that's how sin is we play with sin like it's a toy but if you play with it long enough over time it will begin to play with you and make you its toy maybe you've gotten by with it so far with your own strength your own wisdom your own discipline your own ability but just like Samson's sin will put you to sleep and when you wake up you'll be bound and held captive by it because the Bible says if you sin you are a slave to sin and can I tell you today that's why God hates sin so much because he knows better than anybody else would it cost people in the end Mike Samson the most important thing we give people it's not our talent it's not our influence it's not our money it's our relationship with Jesus and whenever we compromise with sin it separates us and prevents us from staying close to God and as followers of Jesus we have to guard our heart we have to guard our relationship with God we cannot afford to compromise the truth of God's word we can't afford to compromise the conviction of the Holy Spirit we can't afford not to pursue more of Jesus to stay close to Jesus means that you have to keep pursuing more of Jesus if you'll stay committed to obeying God's word and doing what it say it says you will stay close to Jesus if you'll stay committed to being in God's house every Sunday morning every Wednesday night you'll stay close to Jesus if you'll stay committed to praying and seeking after God's presence every day you'll stay close to Jesus if you'll refuse to compromise and stand firm in your faith you'll stay close to Jesus and it's proximity to the presence of God that gives you your strength Samson's captured by the Philistines and the Bible says they gouged his eyes out so that he was blind and they imprisoned him compromise cost Samson a lot of things and some of those things he would never get back but the Bible says in judges 16 Verse 22 but the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved you see even in the lowest moment of Samson's life God was still able to restore the most important thing that he had lost maybe you're here today still dwell in on the past what you've lost all the shaman were guilt that you felt from all your mistakes for so long the Bible says what David prayed in Psalm 51 verse 10 created me a clean heart oh God renew make new a loyal Spirit Within Me Do not banish me from your presence and don't take your Holy Spirit from me but he says restore to me the joy of your salvation and make me willing to obey you my friend you may not be able to change your past and get back everything that you lost but I came to tell somebody today that we serve a God who can still heal and a God who can still restore we serve a God who makes all things new that where sin increase the grace of God increase more you see Samson's story could have ended in defeat and discouragement but it did it and today your story does not have to end that way either the Bible says in Judges chapter 16 verses 28-30 the end of the story Samson prayed to the Lord Sovereign Lord remember me please God strengthen me just one more and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes it says that Samson reads toward the two Central pillars on which the temple stood bracing himself against him his hand on the right his right hand on the one in his left hand on the other Samson said let me die with the Philistines then he pushed with all his might and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it thus he killed more when he died than while he lived I'm not going to ignore the fact that there's no telling what Samson's full potential would have been had he remained fully committed to serving God and his purpose but I don't want to miss this either because all it took was just one moment all it took was one prayer for Samson to fully reconnect himself and he willingly gave his life to do what he should have been doing all along he accomplished more in his death fully committed to God than he did in a lifetime full of compromising and I want you to know today that no matter who you are what you've done what you've been doing all it takes is just one moment for Jesus to change everything all it takes is one prayer to commit or recommit yourself to God so that he can restore you he can heal you and he can make you new the Bible says in James chapter 4 humble yourselves before God resist the devil and he will flee from you come close to God and God will come close to you my friend whether you're a committed follower of Jesus or not I want you to know this promise is for you today if you feel like God is so far away I want you to know he's so much closer than you think his love his peace his Joy his presence his power and his grace are closer than you realize if you'll pursue Jesus and come close to him today he'll come close to you all it takes is One Moment One prayer one decision for God to do what only he can do for you
cFyQZ1P9sus,well today We are continuing in our series called dysfunctional why relationships aren't working in the title of the message I want to preach to you for the next few moments is called Rhett by the wrong people wrecked by the wrong people I heard that oh somebody if you've heard me preach before you get to hear me uh talk about uh certain things a lot I'll talk about sports a lot I'll talk about Ministry a lot talk about my family a lot my wife and I were still newlyweds y'all we've been married nine months not quite a year yet so we're still newlyweds we're still figuring this thing out and there's a few things you learn early on in marriage uh that you don't really think about before you get into it you just figure it out as you go and uh I'll never forget the first time uh a major repair needed to be done and our family the battery in my wife's car had died and you see my wife is the only girl in her family she grew up with two older brothers so she's the baby she's the only girl uh her dad took care of her and gave me a really big shoes to fill in when I made her my bride so when the battery dies I took it upon myself like any good husband if you know anything about your youth pastor uh in growth track when you take the spiritual gifts assessment when it comes to craftsmanship working with your hands like I was negative 17. like I can build a sermon but that's about it I can't build it how like I was that kid struggling to put Lego sets together if you know what I'm saying but I thought man I'm gonna take it upon myself as a husband I'm gonna make sure my wife has the car to get back and forth between schools so my prayer life was good I'm praying in the spirit like Lord I'm just praying while I put my hands on this car it's gonna work but that didn't happen so I popped the hood up and I'm ready I'm like I'm gonna get this battery out put the new one in it's gonna be easy uh just like being the encourager she is she's like now babe if you need to call my dad or your dad for help and I immediately just cut her off and I'm like listen I'm like you know who you married we I'm like I got you girl like I'ma prove it to you so I get out there and I've got my tool set and I pop the hood open I'm ready to get this thing done well I run into some problems I can't even get the the security bar covering the battery to keep it stationary in the car off I'm like I can't even get the bolt to turn I'm like Lord Jesus I'm like uh this is way harder than I thought it was going to be so I'm like well maybe I just need a different tool set so I walk up into the apartment to grab another tool set and she goes oh did you get it fixed already I was like girl I admire your face but nope I need a different tool set she's like oh okay so she's still optimistic at this point wow she's praying in the Holy Spirit while her husband's out there like making a fool of himself so I get out there with the second tool set and sure enough I'm like man I cannot get this thing off like if I just get the battery out of the car we'll be going somewhere here but I can't even do that so I'm like man I know we've got another tool set I'm like God how we have three or four tool sets in this house and yet your boy can't get this battery out of the car it is beyond me so I'm like at this point I'm not praying in the spirit I'm just trying to like keep my flesh in check because I'm walking up the stairs like man what am I gonna say to her when she asked me if I got this thing fixed already or not so I get out there she's like you got it fixed I'm like nope I'm here to get another tool set and then it's like then the worry and the Panic begins to set into her face and I'm like Jesus I need to start praying for my wife and not her car so I get out there with a third tool set and by that point I'm like Lord this third tool setting I'll do nothing for me so I'm like ah there's got to be something I'm doing wrong or there is a demon in this car that we're gonna cast out so I'm just like I'm ready to put my hands on this car and just bleed the blood of Jesus over it but finally after a couple hours go by and it's getting dark and I'm losing daylight I'm like man that two-minute YouTube video didn't do much for me uh I I still I've got too much pride can't call my dad I can't call her dad so I'm like I would just get out the manual and pray that the holy spirit will lead me to the right page with the right information I'm looking and it tells me the size of the tool I need I'm like wait a minute I go through all three of them toolkits and y'all I spent so many hours frustrated getting angry panicking threatened when all along I didn't even have the right tools that I needed to get the battery out of the car and then get it back in so what's your boy do he goes to sleep that night wakes up Friday morning runs to Walmart gets the right tool set and then sure enough what took me hours the day before I just knocked out in a couple minutes I said baby I got that battery in your car let's do this thing and so she gets inside it and then at that point I got my hands on the car and I'm like Lord Jesus I pray the same holy spirit that raised you from the dead would rest upon this car God that when she puts the keys in the ignition and turns it on Lord and it'll start it'll get it get her from point A to point B God it will live and not die declares the Lord God that I will find favor with my wife in Jesus name she started that card and it started running and I said man if it weren't for the grace of God man but I tell you man I learned that day that what I needed to get that car to work the way it needed to man I just needed the right tools and it took me finally stopping and looking at the manual to realize man I had the wrong tools and you know a lot of times when it comes to our relationships we find that they're often not working because they don't have the right people some of us we've got friends but they're not the right friends we've got people but they're the wrong people the wrong friends we've all heard the quote show me your friends and I'll show you your future or how about the right voices lead to the right choices in fact it took me going back to the manual of the car to show me that I didn't have the right tools needed to make it work the way it's supposed to and when you go to God's word it will show you the right people the right relationships that you need to make it work in fact here's what the Apostle Paul he quoted a a Greek philosopher to the Corinthian Church in First Corinthians 15 33 he writes do not be misled Bad Company corrupts good character see what's also true is the flip side of that good company cultivates a blessed life good company it will carry you through tough times and challenging Seasons but the question is how do we find good company today I want to draw your attention to a story found in the Old Testament about good company and it involves three women their names are Naomi Ruth and orpa and first service I still waking up and I called her Oprah I got somebody excited they're like Oprah's in the Bible you pass her end up on YouTube like he preaching false Doctrine over there at People's Church get your kids out of Epic on Wednesday night I'm just kidding we ain't preaching on Oprah but you see Naomi I'll give you some context Naomi was the mother-in-law of the other two ladies Ruth and orpa and the Bible doesn't directly explain how it happened many scholars and theologians uh have their reasonings uh that they suggest behind it but we don't know specifically how it happened but somehow all three of these women had lost their husbands at a similar in a similar time period and they were left as widows and so are and so our story picks up in Ruth chapter one beginning at verse six I'll be reading in the New Living Translation here's what the Bible says then Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had blessed his people in Judah by giving them good crops again so Naomi and her daughters-in-law got ready to leave Moab to return to her Homeland with her two daughters-in-law she set out from the place where she had been living and they took the road that would lead them back to Judah but on the way Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law go back to your mother's homes and may the Lord reward you for your kindness to your husbands and to me may the Lord bless you with the security of another marriage then she kissed them goodbye they all broke down and wept no they said we want to go with you to your people verse 11 but Naomi replied why should you go on with me can I still give birth to other sons who could grow up to be your husbands know my daughters return to your parents homes for I am too old to marry again and even if it were possible and I were to get married tonight and bear Sons then what would you wait for them to grow up and refuse to marry someone else no of course not my daughters things are far more bitter for me than for you because the Lord himself has raised his fist against me and again they wept together and orpa kissed her mother-in-law goodbye but Ruth clung tightly to Naomi look Naomi said to her your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her Gods you should do the same verse 16 says but Ruth replied don't ask me to leave you and turn back wherever you go I will go wherever you live I will live your people will be my people and your God will be my God wherever you die I will die and there I will be buried may the Lord punish me severely if I allow anything but death to separate us when Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her she said nothing more you see Ruth and Naomi's story it shows us not only the power of Faith but also the value of relationships in fact Ruth's name in the Hebrew language it literally translates to the meaning friendship we see in Scripture that God sovereignly worked through a loyal and loving decision made by Ruth to do life with Naomi no matter what you see orpa on the other hand she chose to do life without Naomi and Ruth she went back to the wrong place and she chose to be with the wrong people but Ruth knew that her life would be better with Naomi in it than without her in it she also knew that Naomi's life would be better with her in it rather than if she were to do Life by herself you know how many of you understand it's it's easy to find the right people and for some people or sorry it's easy to find people and it's easy for some of us even to make friends but it's even a greater challenge to find the right people and to make good friends anybody know what I'm talking about this morning you see that's why many of us when it comes to relationships we quit we give up we get frustrated so we just don't even try to make it work anymore and we settle for choosing to do life on our own or instead we choose to do it with the wrong people but what I want us to understand from from God's word today is that relationships can work and we see in the story of Ruth and Naomi that when relationships work God can use them in a powerful way I don't have time to go through chapters one through four we would be here a long time today going through all of that but from this one passage of scripture I want to show you how relationships can work through the story of Ruth Naomi and Orban the first thing I want you to see is this number one the right relationships work by being real with each other the right relationships work by being real with each other so the Bible shows us that Naomi Ruth and orpa all three of them had something in common each of them lost their husband their closest companion and their partner they were they were mourning they were grieving they were experiencing loss they were hurting and they were broken yet because Ruth refused to do life alone because she refused to to allow Naomi to do life alone they were both able to make a massive impact on each other you know the truth is that we all share something in common with each other in this room today all differences aside there's different personalities there's different family backgrounds different careers different stories represented in this room today but the one thing in common we all share together is that we are human and that we all need each other we need relationships go all the way back to Genesis where God says it's not good for a man it's not good for any person to be alone I think a lot of times we forget how God intentionally wired and created us as human beings there is a need and a dependency built and every single one of us to be in relationship with one another you see the Bible says in Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24 one who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother so the Bible specifically tells us that the wrong people can wreck your life man there's somebody in this room today you feel like your life is the hot mess Express and it's one wreck after another and it's simply because you do not have the right people in your corner influencing you to make the right decisions the wrong people will wreck your life unreliable friends can bring destruction to your life but the Bible says that a real friend will stay close to you like a brother stays close to his brother or his sister I want to put it to you this way I'm gonna get all youth pastorary on you today and show you a little illustration so I've got up here two dollar bills I've got a one dollar uh bill with Mr Wash or President Washington excuse me on it and then I've got a 100 bill from the life or death game called Monopoly all right now if I were to give you two options let's just say I was in a generous mood today to to offer you a choice which one of these bills if I offered you both of them which one would you take you would take the my bowl praise God I'm glad I did not hear anybody say the the the the Monopoly one if I were to ask you why you would tell me Pastor Andrew because that one dollar bill is authentic but this 100 Monopoly bill is not they're both made of paper but one of them serves in actual purpose in real life come on somebody and then the other one is for a made-up make-believe game and I get it this is totally Elementary you're like Pastor Andrew we are not NPC kids today like why are you using this illustration because this is such a simple thought that many of us understand when it comes to our money we look at the face value and we're like yes one's a hundred one one is one but the value is not in the face value it's in the purpose that it serves it's in the quality one is authentic one is real and the other is not you see that so simple and easy for us to understand but the problem is there's many of us who are pursuing and settling for things that never really even add value in our lives there's people that you have chosen to do life with people that you've allowed into your life who just are not good for you there there's people you influencers that you follow on social media who do not add any value to your life but there's also relationships in people that God has in your life that will add value that will serve a purpose you see we need to stop allowing the wrong people to influence us to make the wrong choices we need to stop with allowing the wrong voices the wrong influences to influence our relationships and our decisions you see our relationships will only work with the right people Proverbs 27 17 it says as iron sharpens iron so one person sharpens another man the problem is is that a lot of us we don't like being sharpened because sometimes there's friction sometimes when when when God uses a relationship when God uses a person to add value in your life it can be painful it can be humbling and it won't always feel good but God didn't just call you to do life with people he called you to do life with the right people God didn't just call you to listen listen to any voice he called you to listen to the right voices hear me today church God created all of us what they need for relationship in our lives and the truth is we are better together but you see relationships they're like anything else in your life you will get out of it whatever you put into it the right relationships man okay y'all like that I'm gonna say that again then y'all get you will get out of your relationships whatever you put in to your relationships you see the right relationships why so many of us settle for fake when we want the real thing we settle for Faith because we don't want to put in the work it takes to have this it's the little Investments over time that compound with interest that lead to the right relationship and the blessed life that God has called for each and every single one of us you see the right relationships they take work and some of us just don't want to work that's why we throw in the towel and give up on relationships so soon and we fly solo or we settle for what's easy but God didn't call you to what's easy he calls you to what's real and what will last see one of the reasons relationships don't work is because we won't work we get frustrated we get discouraged so we settle for the wrong people or we settle to do life on our own we stop giving and we stop investing in relationships and we just don't put ourselves in a position anymore for the right people the right voices and the right influences to invest in our lives but here's what I want you to walk with walk away with today listen you don't have to know everybody but you do need to know somebody you don't have to know everyone you don't have to do life with everybody but you do need to do life with someone the Bible says in Ecclesiastes chapter 4 verses 9 through 10 two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor if either of them falls down one can help the other up but pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up listen we all go through seasons in life where we fall we make mistakes we fall short or we all go through situations and circumstances in life where we get knocked down you see the one of the most powerful ways that God chooses to move in your life is through people it's through the right people the right relationships God always uses the right relationships to speak to us to challenge us to encourage us and to develop us even through the most difficult and challenging seasons in our lives and can I tell you this is exactly why we do small groups here at People's Church we don't do small groups because as a programmer because that's just the cool thing to do if you're an American church we do small groups here at People's Church because we believe what the Bible says we believe that God created each of us with a need for Community we believe that we're better together and as a church we refuse to let anyone do life alone come on we are the body of Christ the Bible says that if one part of the body rejoices the entire body rejoices if one part of the body is hurting and in pain then the whole entire body is hurting and in pain you see to experience the right relationships with the right people we all need a space to be real with one another we have to be real about our issues our insecurities our fears we have to be real about our dreams our passions and our faith and so as we get ready to launch our summer small group semester here at People's Church you can lead a group or you can even be a part of a group but let me ask you this what would happen in your life this season this summer what would God be able to do if you were to step out in faith leave your comfort zone put some work in and be involved in a real Biblical Community with the right relationships working because you're surrounded by the right people remember you don't need to know everybody but you need to know somebody you don't have to trust everybody you shouldn't trust everybody but you can trust somebody you don't need to be real with everyone but you need to be real with someone you don't need to do life with everyone but you need to do life with someone because the right relationships work by being real with each other and then number two the right relationships work with God at the center the right relationships work with God at the center the most impactful way that Naomi had influenced Ruth was through her relationship with God and I don't have time to unpack all this the way I would I would normally like to but the Bible clearly shows us that that Ruth was a moabite she was from Moab Naomi however was an Israelite from the tribe of Judah and that's significant because these two different cultures worshiped two completely different ways the moabites worshiped multiple Pagan deities if you would in fact one of the the gods that they would Worship in ancient times they would do so through child sacrifice whereas Naomi was worshiping the god of the Bible Yahweh the god of Israel the one we worship today and yet you see two different cultures two different World Views two different belief systems yet we see that scripture shows us God was able to use Naomi in a way to influence Ruth Ruth said man I don't care what happens I understand that she's going to do life with you means I've got to leave my people to be with your people and I gotta walk away from these gods and I'm going to worship your God you see what I love about the story of Ruth is that Naomi is just at it with God there's so like if y'all could just get a glimpse of Naomi's prayer life after she literally said was wanting to change her name from Naomi to Mara because Mara means bitter she was bitter and blamed God and held him responsible for all the bad things that happened in her life she's wrestling with her faith yet her faith was even strong enough even when it was being tested to influence a moabite widow to come to know the true God of the Bible you see listen scripture it shows us that God was not only the center of Naomi's life but he was also the center of her relationship with Naomi my friend today if your faith is tested don't think that's a bad thing your faith doesn't have to be perfect to make a difference in somebody else's life your faith has to be centered on who Jesus is Jesus said in Matthew 22 verses 34-40 it's a story it tells a story hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees the Pharisees got together one of them an expert in the law tested him with this question teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law and Jesus replied love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind this is the greatest commandment and the second is like it you must love your neighbor as yourself all the law and the prophets hang on these two Commandments Jesus said not only is loving God with every fiber of your being and loving other people just as you love yourself the greatest commandment but he said literally all these other hundred laws that you have been trained to follow from the day you were born as a Jew he goes they all hang and come from these two things you love God and you love people Jesus was trying to teach us that the most important thing you not only give yourself but that you give other people in your life is your relationship with God church this is the most important thing God must be the center of your life and God must be the center in your relationships I remember my first car growing up was a 2000 Dodge Stratus and man while I everybody's got a special love for their first car I did for a season and then I quickly started hating it because here's what I learned about uh my first car and what's typical about when you drive a you know your first car or a car that's older and has some character to it especially when you're driving in Indiana it's like there's brother pothole over there and then sister pothole over there and so when you're in older cars what I learned is a 17 18 year old driving uh early on in my life was oftentimes I would hit a pothole in that old car and all of a sudden when I get home it was like my car went and drive straight I'd get so frustrated because I'm like man I wasn't doing anything stupid and it's just like now my car won't stay centered on the road I remember like doing what any good son would do right I come home and I'm like Dad something's wrong with my car he's like oh Lord what's wrong son and I'm like my car won't drive straight he's like did you hit a pothole I'm like yeah how did you know and he's like you need an alignment I'm like wait that you haven't even looked at it like how do you know it's just a dad thing right so dad's like your your car is out of alignment what you have to do to get it censored on the road again to be able to let go and it to stay centered you have to get it realigned listen church this is what I've learned about relationships too you'll experience conflict you'll experience dysfunction you'll experience trials and tribulations you'll experience your own Pride your own selfishness that oftentimes will try to get you out of alignment with God's will with God's word and with God's way for your relationships and what you have to do in those moments is recognize if you're wondering today how do I know if Jesus is the center of my life you have to know am I in alignment with what his word says with what his will is and the way Jesus is modeled for me to follow and it's in those moments sometimes where we have to Humble ourselves and we have to re-align our lives and put Jesus back at The Sinner because can I tell you there's going to be things that fight for your priority there's going to be things that fight for your heart there's going to be things that fight for your relationships what you need to understand today is that for anything in your life especially your relationships to succeed Jesus has to be at the center and Luke chapter 6 verses 47-49 I love what Jesus says he says that's for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice I will show you what they are like they are like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid the foundation on Rock when a flood came and the turret struck in the house uh and or yeah and the turret struck the house but could not shake it because it was built well built verse 49 but the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation the moment the turret struck that house it collapsed and its destruction was complete listen church when you allow God to be at the center of your life in your relationships you are building your life and your relationships on a firm foundation you see the truth in life we're always going to face adversity we're always going to face hardship and many other difficulties and circumstances but I want you to know today that when the word of God is your foundation and when Jesus is at the center of your life and your relationships baby it does not matter what storms come your way or what you encounter and have to endure because you're alive and your relationships can withstand any storm you face in your life if you will stand firm on the foundation of God's word and keep Jesus at the center of it all friend don't just allow God to be involved in your life don't let God just be a part of your life and make him the center make him your foundation don't just settle for God being a part of your relationships but put Jesus at the center of every relationship in your life listen don't leave God out of anything or any relationship in your life don't leave him out of anything because listen the right relationships they can work they can work but you need the right people around you and you have to put God at the center and you have to keep Jesus at the center and everything else will fall into place if you would please bow your heads and close your eyes
MrQ2qfAWX9M,and today our youth pastor Pastor Andrew is going to be ringing bringing the word today he has a word for you and so come on would you put your hands together for pastor Andrew if your students don't come on Wednesday night they need to come with our amazing youth ministry here you go brother man thank you come on can we give Jesus a great big hand clap today amen come on you didn't let the cold Indiana weather all that white stuff on the ground keep you from spending the first Sunday of 2024 in God house and that is phenomenal thank you so much Pastor Chris for the honor the privilege the opportunity to to stand in the pull pit and to preach to God's people today excited for the new year everything that God has in store for each of us and for our church and as Pastor Chris said yes I am the youth pastor uh every Wednesday night we meet here at People's Church and minister to middle school and high school students all over our city we have the wonderful opportunity to reach so many uh different middle schools and high schools here in our city and so if you're a student or you've got students parents and we've not had a chance to connect I would love to do that later today I'll be out in the lobby uh by the door to answer any questions you may have would love to to meet with you connect with you and figure out how we can partner with you to help continue to see more changed lives in the Next Generation because in 2023 our youth ministry turned four years old and we saw God do so many incredible things but we are hungry and believing for more for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit on this generation like never before and we would love for you to be a part of it and so it's an honor uh to serve the Next Generation here in our church and People's Church I just cannot think of any better way to kick off this new year than by being in God's house today how many of you are ready to see God move in your life this year like never before amen that's that's not bad for the 9:30 service come on somebody you see I believe that that 2024 will be the best year of your life yet if it's your best year spiritually and that's why it's so important what we are doing together as a church to dedicate the first these NE or these next three weeks rather to God through prayer and fasting and so the goal today what I would love to do is give you what I feel like is a word from the Lord to prepare our hearts and to prepare our church for prayer and fasting so we can see God move in our lives you know with a new year comes so many highs and so many lows if you recall this past year of your life and for your family I'm sure there were more than you could count of wins learns and everything in between right and you see I believe that the Bible lets us know there is a key a supernatural key to experiencing breakthrough in our lives there's a there's a key if you will that God has shown us clearly in scripture to help us walk in Victory every single day as followers of Jesus so today I'm not only want to prepare our hearts for the next 21 days if you will but rather for the next I think it's 359 I went to Bible College so they don't really teach you math they just teach you the Bible so we'll go with 359 all right but to prepare our hearts to see God move like never before these next 359 days and so today I want to preach to you on the subject I've entitled the secret to seeing God move the secret to seeing God move in Mark chapter 9 we read this story about a a boy that the Bible says was oppressed by an evil spirit so this boy's father he he brings the boy to Jesus's disciples so that they can lay hands on him pray for him and deliver the evil spirit from him but for some reason for those of you familiar with the story you know that the dis disciples were not able to deliver this boy from this evil spirit and Chaos ensues there's people there arguing trying to figure out no you do it this way or they're like well what did you and they're like so confused they're frustrated they're trying to help this boy and his father but they can't so this completely catches them off guard because up to this point in their Ministry Jesus had sent all 12 of his disciples out in groups of two he's like you're going to to lay hands on the sick and they're going to be healed you're going to do this that and the other yall going to get out here and get some W's all right they were killing it in Ministry with Jesus up to this point but finally they get stumped and they're like well what do we do we've tried to do everything that we can think of so then Jesus he finally arrived at the scene in Mark chapter n and he looks over everything that's happening and he told them he said bring the boy to me and the Bible says that Jesus rebuked M the evil spirit he says you deaf and mute Spirit you come out of this boy and you never enter him again and the Bible says that immediately the Spirit came out of the boy and it left him so after this happened Jesus's disciples they're just standing there like what in the world he made it look so easy they're confused they're discouraged they're frustrated they're like we did all these things that that Jesus could do that Jesus even said we could do but we weren't able to deliver this boy from this evil spirit they're like what's up with that so finally they get enough courage to to go to Jesus and inquire about why they weren't able to deliver this boy from the evil spirit we look at verse 28 of Mark chapter 9 it says that after Jesus had gone indoors his disciples asked him privately that's probably a question you would want to ask privately after one of the most embarrassing moments in your ministry they they asked him privately why couldn't we drive it out you ever wondered God why couldn't why couldn't I figure my marriage out God why couldn't I figure my kids out why couldn't I figure my career out my education God all these things you you planted in in my heart that I never saw come to fruition yet God how how was I not able to do this in verse 29 this is the key right here says that Jesus replied this kind can come out only by prayer and if you read that verse in the new in the new King James version it says that Jesus said this kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting people church I want you to know that there are only some breakthroughs in your life you'll only experience through prayer there are some blessings that will only come to your life if you choose to fast and seek after more of God you see fasting and prayer they go hand inand together if you try to fast without praying man you that's just a hunger strike fasting is designed to help you connect to God more through prayer and you see church family there are numerous victories ahead of you in 2024 but I believe the key to unlocking many of those victories is only found in prayer and God's word lets us know there are only certain breakthroughs certain blessings certain victories that will only happen as a direct response to prayer in fact scripture tells us plainly that prayer is in fact the secret to seeing God move and today I want to give you 10 reasons why it's important 10 reasons why you must make prayer your highest priority in 2024 for so that you can experience the move of the holy spirit in your life like never before 10 reasons to make prayer a priority in 20124 and why prayer is essential number one the first reason is this is because prayer is the basis of our relationship with God prayer in its Essence it's the very Foundation of our relationship with Jesus Christ the Bible says in Romans chapter 10:9 if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is with your heart that you believe and are Justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved verse 13 it says for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved you see prayer is not only what begins our relationship with God at the moment of salvation but it's also what sustains our relationship with God after that first moment you see it took prayer to get it going and it's also going to take prayer to keep it going it's like the man who started off the new year praying this he said dear God so far today I've done all right I haven't gossiped I haven't lost my temper I haven't been greedy grumpy nasty I haven't argued with my wife and I'm very thankful for that but in a few M minutes Lord I'm going to get out of this bed and from then on I'm going to need a lot more help in Jesus name amen come on how many of be honest you prayed that prayer before or something similar to it you see in all seriousness church family prayer is the key to not just starting a relationship with God but to Growing your relationship with God as a follower of Jesus prayer is the secret to seeing a move of God in your life number two is this the second reason is because prayer brings forgiveness of sin prayer brings forgiveness of sin you see the truth is as I'm sure all of us are aware is that none of us are perfect neither of us are always going to get it right this year we all fall short the Bible says we miss the Mark we miss the standard of perfection and Holiness that God has and whenever we do the Bible calls it sin and we do things we shouldn't do we say things we shouldn't say but to be honest the devil would want nothing more than for us to run from God than to run to God whenever we do slip up and the Bible calls him the accuser for a reason because he is constantly condemning us for our sin he is working over time doing everything he can to make us feel like we've done too much or we are too far gone because we have fallen short but I'm thankful today for the truth of God's word that is louder than any lie the enemy tries to speak over our lives in first John chap 1 ver9 it says if we confess our sins to him it's easy to try to keep it a secret it's easy to try to figure it out on your own or to deal with it by yourself but the Bible says when we confess our sins to him he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to clle CLE us from all wickedness you see sin works against prayer but prayer works against sin or in other words you could say it this way the more you sin the less you pray but the more you pray the less you sin prayer brings forgiveness and refreshing of our sin number three here's the third reason prayer helps you to discern God's will prayer helps you to discern God's will in Acts chapter 133 we read where the New Testament Church had just started and they're trying to figure out leaders and where to assign people and they have all these important big decisions to make and in verse uh Acts chapter 13 verse2 it says that while they were worshiping the Lord they were fasting they were praying the holy spirit said to them set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them they were fasting they were praying they were worshiping they were dedicating time and space for the Holy Spirit to move to give them discernment and to give them the direction that they needed and I want to encourage somebody today with this listen you don't need to have all the answers right now you do not need to have everything figured out in your life at this moment but it is necessary that you look to the Lord for guidance in every single area of your life and in everything that you do see I truly believe that during these next 21 days of prayer and fasting as we commit ourselves to God to experience more of him and all that he has for us I believe that there are going to be people who will receive Clarity discernment direction that they've been seeking for a long long time I know that's happened in my life more often than I can count when I've had to pray about God where do you want me to go to college where do you want me to work where do you where do you want me to lead who do you want me to marry those are big decisions that you don't make emotionally thoughtlessly or without prayer prayerfully make those decisions we have to be committed to prayer as followers of Jesus because prayer is what enables us to discern God's will for our lives number four here's the fourth reason prayer strengthens you it strengthens you Psalm 105:4 the Bible says look to the Lord and his strength seek his face always church family there will be days when you feel down when you feel weak you're tired fatigued you're discouraged you're going to feel like giving up and quitting on school giving up and quitting on your marriage on your family on your purpose or on your job but it's time in God's presence that will provide you and equip you with the supernatural strength that you need to sustain you and to help you persevere through every obstacle through every hardship in your life we need to be people of prayer because prayer strengthens us and number five the fifth reason is this prayer gives you peace prayer gives you peace the Bible says in Psalm 34 verses 4-5 I prayed to the Lord and he answered me he freed me from all my fears those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy no shadow of Shame will darken their faces man life sure does have a way of working against our peace doesn't it you see stress bills problems conflict sickness decisions everything in here in between when we try to tackle them on our own often times we find ourselves short of the peace we need in our mind in our heart and in our life it's almost impossible to live with peace in the midst of all that but you see prayer is the key to experiencing the Peace of Jesus that surpasses all understanding and all explanation Paul writes this in Philippians chapter 4: 6 and 7 he says do not be anxious about anything that's what all the people who struggle with anxiety just love hear and right don't be anxious but he says this he offers a solution he says in every every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving he says present your requests to God in other words he's saying stop trying to keep it all in here and processes in here he says process It Out Loud by taking it to God through your prayer and petitions and he says this is what will happen when you do in verse seven the peace of God which transcends all understanding it will guard your hearts and guard your minds in Christ Jesus you see less prayer will equal less peace but more prayer will equal more peace prayer gives us peace number six prayer gives you victory over Temptation prayer gives you victory over Temptation Jesus said this to his disciples in Matthew chapter 26 ver 41 he says Watch and Pray so that you will not fall into temptation you see Jesus was well aware that his followers would overcome a lot of adversity in Life or have to go through adversity and overcome it in life you see he knew the devil would do everything he absolutely could to try to trap them to make them stumble and fall and that's why he told his disciples to pray you see the same is true for you and me today how many of you know that the devil is working over time to set traps and snares all around us the truth is that all of us have fallen into different Temptations at times perhaps some of you you find yourself repeating the same mistakes over and over and over again and today all you feel is the shame and the regret and the hopelessness of I'll never be able to overcome this but I'm telling you that prayer will open your spiritual eyes what that means is you'll be able to look at your circumstances to look at at your problems and your struggles the way that God looks at them you will be spiritually alert and aware of what the enemy is trying to do in your life you're not going to easily be deceived or persuaded or lured into that sin or that Temptation maybe you're sitting here today and you're like I wish I didn't abuse drugs I wish I didn't have this drinking habit I wish I didn't have to be bound by this addiction I wish that I didn't have to be trapped in pornography I wish that I didn't have to be to struggle with losing my temper that's costing me my marriage and my relationship with my kids my friend you have to remember the words of Jesus that there are some things in your life that will only be broken there are some things in your life you will only be delivered and set free from through prayer and fasting the key to seeing a move of God in your life is through prayer see prayer gives us victory over Temptation number seven prayer makes us wiser prayer makes you wiser how many of you know our world it's a new year now but our world just keeps getting more complicated and complicated there's so much moral and ethical ambiguity there's political and social tension and unrest everyone has an opinion about everything right but you see the Bible tells us this in James chapter 1 verse5 says if any of you lacks wisdom you should ask God who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to you I love that because James is saying you don't need qualifications or credentials to have wisdom Divine wisdom from God all you have to do is ask he will freely and generously give it to you prayer gives us wisdom number eight prayer brings God's healing prayer brings brings God's healing you see you can pray any time anywhere and about anything you don't have to call Pastor Chris or myself or another Pastor on staff at People's Church to come where you are and pray over you because the Bible makes it clear all you have to do is pray in the name of Jesus for that person to be healed and they'll be healed but James goes on to say in chapter 5 verses 13 through 15 this is where we see it in scripture is anyone among you in trouble let them pray is any one happy let them sing songs of praise is anyone among you sick let them call the Elders or the leaders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well the Lord will raise them up if they have sinned they will be forgiven I love this because here at people church this is exactly why we pray for needs why we pray over the sick here in our church services as you just saw us do a few moments ago because it's biblical that's why it's important for us as followers of Jesus to be faithful to church to be faithful to God's house and to God's word in 2024 and when you have a need I want to challenge and encourage somebody today when you have a need would you take out a would you take a step of Faith put your trust in God's word knowing that if I do what his word says he's going to honor his promise and keep his end of the deal step out in faith come to the front pray the prayer of faith and watch God move in your life prayer brings God's healing number nine prayer brings spiritual intervention prayer brings spiritual intervention in Daniel chapter n the Bible uh tells us that Daniel had been praying he had been fasting he had been seeking the Lord for an answer to his prayer and the angel the Lord Lord comes to him and in verse 23 he tells him this he says as soon as you began to pray a word went out which I have come to tell you for you are highly esteemed man sometimes it's easy to feel like our prayers just hit the ceiling and bounce right back down to the floor and it never makes it to heaven or we've been praying for a breakthrough for a miracle for provision for years and years and years the Bible tells us that as soon as we utter the name of Jesus that word from Heaven has goes out because of our prayers I love that God's word tells us as soon as we pray and seek the face of God that heaven responds on our behalf if you feel like you're family is under spiritual attack I want to encourage you to fast and pray and say Lord rather than just eating lunch today I'm going to look to you because I need your help I need this healing I'm desperate for your presence I'm desperate for a victory and a breakthrough in my life and as soon as you call on Jesus he's with you he is for you before you go into the meeting before you take the exam student before you have that difficult conversation you call on the name of the Lord Jesus in prayer he is with you he is working fighting on your behalf and then number 10 the 10th reason is this is because God rewards those who diligently seek him God rewards those who diligently seek Him says this in Hebrews 11 verse six without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him those who earnestly seek him you know what that verse doesn't say is that the person who prays once and every now and again or the person who prays when there's a a 911 emergency it says the person that earnestly the person that has made themsel diligent devoted to prayer that's made prayer priority in their life People's Church I know I believe this promise in scripture today and that we can take God at his word let's do our part and let's seek him let's believe in faith that God will honor his word he'll keep his promise and that he will reward us when we seek Him you see we make prayer a priority as followers of Jesus because there are things that happen when we pray that will never happen if we don't pray we have so many reasons to pray I just gave you 10 of them I didn't give you every single reason I just gave you 10 of them but all those reasons and things you think to yourself man why don't I pray as often as I should why am I not diligently seeking after more of God like I know I need to why don't we prioritize prayer you see I believe all of us myself included If we're honest we could Elevate our prayer life in 2024 why don't we prioritize prayer there well sometimes we just don't know what to say right have you ever been there where it's like we're going to take 10 15 minutes to pray together and you're like do you like hear 10 minutes of prayer and you're like freaking out like I don't know how to talk to a human being for 10 minutes how am I supposed to talk to God for 10 minutes what do I say you know you struggle to know how to pray you feel like man am I doing it right maybe you don't feel spiritual enough I want you to know you're not alone you're not alone like anything else in life it you become better at it and more comfortable with it the more often you practice it and make it a habit and a discipline in your life more and more I just want to encourage somebody today start where you are today it doesn't matter if you've been living for Jesus Jesus since yesterday or for the past 30 40 50 60 years we all need to grow in the area of Prayer in our life start where you are today make it a priority by giving every day to the Lord something we encourage our Stu students to do uh at Epic youth on Wednesday nights is we teach them a a practice or a spiritual discipline called five five five and what that there's three different increments of five so in total it's 15 minutes you have five minutes of worship so we just encourage our students man find your favorite worship album or song or playlist and just begin to play it spend time worshiping the Lord thanking him for all the blessings all the ways he's provided you all the ways he's been good and faithful to you and then five minutes transition into five minutes of Bible reading we encourage our students to download if they have a phone or a device to download the uver Bible app we uh have different reading plans on there that you can read or maybe some of us we can do a proverb a day you can start reading in the New Testament there's so many different things you can do to immerse yourself in scripture so five minutes of worship five minutes of reading God's word and then five minutes of prayer we tell our students man spend at least five minutes being in God's presence because we believe what the Bible says James says come close to God and God will come close to you there's so many different ways you can come come closer to God this is just one of them the 555 but when you come to 21 days of prayer and fasting you'll learn how to pray we'll guide you we'll walk you through it we want to help you we are committed as a church to helping you grow in the area of Prayer in your life another reason we don't prioritize prayer is some of us struggle to believe that God will answer our prayer I heard a story from a few years back it was around 2005 2006 there was a a crisis in Chattanooga Tennessee because what ended up happening because the 911 call center had been short staffed that year alone there was nearly 20% of 911 calls that went unanswered could you imagine picking up your house is on fire something going on in the neighborhood you pick up your phone and call 911 and there's nobody at the end of the other line it was a it was a diff diffult time for this city but it reminds me of how thankful I am that heaven is not short on staff and that we serve a God who always hears prayer and always answers he may not always answer how I want him to or when I want him to but he promises he hears us he will always answer us sometimes he says no sometimes he says slow sometimes he says go what do I mean you see when God tells us no it's because sometimes our plans are misguided you remember the there's a story in the Bible where Jesus's disciples wanted them to call fire down from heaven and just wipe out this town and Jesus is like um no that's not what I came here to do we're not that's that's H maybe don't pray that prayer but I admire your faith right that he goes that's a no slow sometime it's not just no maybe it's not now God's like you're asking for the right things you're seeking the right things but I need you to trust my timing because my timing is perfect don't stop praying keep believing trust in God's timing and sometimes God says go what does that mean that's when God gives you the green light and says hey you prayed I gave you an answer now do it be blessed be be obedient to the word you've received you see regardless of how or when God answers he always answers but we have to do our part and pray and lastly number three we don't prioritize prayer because we get busy we get busy now God doesn't want us to feel badly or feel guilty when we miss prayer time he's not mad at us but he desires us to be with him in prayer because he knows how much prayer will help us and that's why he tells us in the Bible to make prayer a priority in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 it says pray without or it says pray continually another translation says pray without ceasing I was going this is funny it's has nothing to do with a message but I want to make you laugh one time I was in a small in our young adult small group and my wife was uh sharing something about how we should all commit ourselves to pray and she was like yeah in the Bible it says pray without seasoning or wait no pray without ceasing and I thought that was so good so the next time you go to season your food or you see seasoning at the store remember pray without ceasing let that be your reminder hey it's time to pray church family prayer is not something to add to your to-do list it should consume your list we need to prioritize what matters the most and keep the main thing the main thing because it will affect everything church family I want to encourage you make prayer and fasting a priority this year would you make every effort to be at prayer early morning prayer these next 21 days 6:00 a.m. on Monday through Friday 9:00 am on Saturdays God has a blessing for you in 2024 church family there are victories waiting for you there's it's going to be an incredible year but you need to remember that the secret to seeing and living and all that God has for you is found in your commitment to prayer can we bow our heads and close our eyes
WuMMQXU3-DE,and today we're starting this new series on Miracles and we are going to slightly change our order of service for this miracle series normally on a Sunday we would start off with four worship songs but for this series we're always going to start off with three songs and then we're gonna save the fourth song at the end because we want to have a time to pray for miracles right it's a miracle series and we want to pray uh have a time to pray and so just so you know for this series it'll be three songs on the front end and and uh most Sundays it'll be a fourth song at the end um where we can pray for miracles well the title of my message today is the one ingredient you need for a miracle the one ingredient you need for a miracle my favorite season is almost here it's peeking his head around the corner fall is my favorite anybody fall your favorite time of the year oh I love fall come on football Lord be with the Colts touch Anthony Richardson make him the greatest of all time and so we got football high school football college football pro football if you're wondering what your pastor's doing Friday Saturday and Sunday one word football man I'm also spending time with my family you know but I try to bring them along with me hey let's watch some football but it's football starts to be fall weather love to start seeing the the trees start to the leaves changing colors and come on we'll start it's in in a Smith household it's baking season all right matter of fact since it got a little cool this week Jamie made two pumpkin loafs two because she made one on Monday and that bad boy was gone on Tuesday she made another one on Thursday I thought it was Friday I think it's gone again oh bacon season matter of fact my daughter Cali got into baking season it was like it was a school it was 10 o'clock and I'm like Cali what are you there's flower flying in the kitchen I'm like Hallie what are you doing I'm baking something I'm making my masterpiece I'm like uh you need to get to bed and clean all of this up better be all clean in the morning yes Dad and I went to bed and so woke up the next morning and it was all clean I was like okay Callie and there was this nice little apple crisp on the island hey Kelly and so I was about to take a little piece of it and James like oh don't eat that and I'm like why oh it's disgusting see for Cali when it's baking season she doesn't use recipes she just started throwing stuff together and she did fairly well except she didn't put any butter in the crust and if you know anything about baking you can't have a crust without butter and so uh Jamie got that surprise and she saved me but that butter if you got a pie crust butter is one of the main ingredients and that's like going to Chick-fil-A and they have no chicken it's like going to a Mexican restaurant there's no chips and salsa that's like going to a barbecue restaurant they don't have ribs or barbecue sauce they're going to an Italian restaurant they're like we don't have any pasta and if we were to pull out a recipe card for miracles what would be the number one ingredient what would be the most important ingredient in a miracle is that praying long prayers praying short prayers is it praying faith-filled prayers is it praying in Jesus name is it praying quiet prayers is it shouting is it coming to church is it fasting is it quoting the Bible do you stand up and lift your hands maybe it's it's kneeling down and Reverend and or laying prostrate on the floor is it asking someone who is spiritual to pray for you what is the number one ingredient and I want to teach you the number one thing you need to receive your miracle there's only one common denominator you see in every miracle in the Bible if you study miracles from the beginning of the Old Testament to the end of the New Testament you will find only one common denominator the Bible records over a hundred and sixty Miracles and there's only one common denominator in every Miracle here goes are you ready you're right here it is you need a need you need a need Miracles only happened in the Bible where there was a need you have to need a miracle to receive a miracle a need is an invitation for the power of God needs attract the power of God and if you're wondering if you're a candidate for a miracle there's only one thing you need to answer that question do you have a need if you need a miracle today please lift your hand you are a candidate for the power of God his miraculous power to show up in your life and I want to show you how Miracles took place in the Bible because there was a need I don't ever want you to view your needs the same way after this message your needs attract the power of God let's look at the Old Testament first Humanity needed a home God knew he was going to create his prized possession Humanity you can go ahead tell your neighbor you're a prized possession go ahead tell them you're a prized possession he knew that we needed a home well before he before he created Adam and Eve he performed a miracle and he created the heavens and the Earth Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth the very first verse in the Bible is about God performing a miracle to meet our need your needs attract the power of God Abraham and Sarah needed a son God promised Abraham and Sarah's son years went by and they couldn't get pregnant when Abraham was around 99 and Sarah was 80 90 years old the Bible says this Genesis 21 verse 1 and 2. now the Lord was gracious to Sarah as he had said and the Lord did for Sarah what he had promised Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the very time God had promised him they needed a baby and God showed up with his power I know there are some married couples here today who have been having issues for years getting pregnant and we're going to believe God for a miracle Our God loves to show up with his power when a situation seems impossible or hopeless your needs attract the power of God Moses needed God's Clarity on his calling Moses had a dream in calling on his life to deliver the people his people from the slavery in Egypt but he made a huge mistake he murdered a man and so he fled Egypt and 40 years passed by and Moses thought his dream was dead he thought he was going to be taking care of sheep for the rest of his life but God performed a miracle Exodus 3 2 it says the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the flames of fire from within a Bush Moses saw that though the Bush was on fire it did not burn up God spoke to Moses through a burning bush and gave him Clarity on his calling he told Moses to go back to Egypt and lead them Israel out of the Egyptian bondage some of you today you feel like your dream is dead you feel like it will never happen you've messed up you've blown it today God wants to give you a burning bush he wants to give you Clarity on your calling he's not done with you failure is not final your needs attract the power of God the Israelites needed Deliverance as the Israelites were fleeing Egypt the Egyptian Army was pursuing them and then they got to the Red Sea and they were trapped and they were about to be taken back into bondage but in Exodus 14 21-22 God performed a miracle and the Red Sea the waters divided and they walked across on dry ground with the Sea of water on the right side in the sea of water on the left side and then when the enemies continue to pursue them the waters collapsed on their enemies and they drowned some of you are in bondage to something and you need freedom some of you have been set free from some type of bondage and you're starting to slip back into the bondage slip back into the addiction again God wants you free today your needs attract the power of God the Israelites needed Divine Direction after the Israelites left to Egypt they were in the wilderness and they needed Divine Direction and Exodus 13 21 it says God provided a cloud during the day and fire at night that led the Israelites through wilderness some of you are desperately needing Direction in this season of your life you don't know what to do you take the job do you marry the person do you go to that college do you sell or buy the home or your kids at the right school you have some big decisions to make and you need Divine Direction and God loves to give his people Divine Direction your needs attract the power of God the Israelites needed food and water they were in the wilderness they needed food and water and exodus 16 4 tells us God rain down from heaven Manna they were having banana shakes and banana bread and banana cream pie and then Exodus 17 5-6 it says God provided water out of a rock God provided for their basic needs of the Israelites in a miraculous way and some of you you have fallen on Hard Times and you're wondering how you're going to put food on the table hear me God sees your need God knows where you are God wants to provide for you your needs attract the power of God the Israelites needed victory over their enemy the Israelites they leave the Wilderness and they get to the city called Jericho God promised them the city but there are there's walls surrounding the city and God told people to March around that wall seven times and then to shout in Joshua 6 20 tells us that the people shouted and the walls collapsed and they took a city God made a wall to fall with a shout and then Israelites defeated their enemy and took the city is anybody facing some enemies anybody anybody facing some enemies if you need victory over an enemy God has the power to help you your needs attract the power of God Jonah needed radical repentance God told Jonah I want you to go that way to Nineveh and Jonathan I ain't going that way he went the opposite way got on a boat and in God's sent a storm Jonah was enthroned overboard and God sent a fish to rescue Jonah and Jonah 2 10 it says God commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah on the dry land after this experience Jonah repented and obeyed God some of you are running from God your life is going in the wrong direction you're running from God instead of two God you're running away from his plan and purpose for your life you need to repent God has been sending so many things your way to bring you back to him God will send a storm a fish a person a problem or something else to bring you back to him your needs attract the power of God a widow needed her resources multiplied Second Kings Four one through seven there's a story of a widow she didn't have any money to pay her bills and the prophet told her to go gather jars from her neighbors and she had a little oil and he told her to start pouring the oil into the jars and when she did that God showed up with his miraculous power and the oil kept filling until every jar was filled and then she sold the oil and she paid her bills somebody today needs a financial miracle and I'm here to tell you God is able your needs attract the power of God Shadrach Meshach and Abednego needed protection an evil King through these three Hebrew boys into a fiery furnace they were destined to die but Daniel 3 25 he said look I see four men walking around in the fire Unbound and unharmed and the fourth looks like a son of the Gods God showed up in the fire with these three Hebrew boys and they brought these boys out of the fire and they didn't have a burn on them or any of their clothing listen oftentimes God's miracle-working power doesn't keep you from the fires of Life instead his power sustains you and protects you in the midst of the Fire come on can anybody testify that God has sustained and protected you in the middle of the Fire come on that car wreck should have injured you the divorce should have destroyed you what they did to you should have paralyzed you from moving forward you should have lost your mind you should be dead but God God sustained and protected you in the fire somebody needs to hear this today you're in the middle of the fire and your God can sustain and protect your needs attract the power of God all throughout the Old Testament the one common denominator for a miracle is a need all you need is the need church I don't ever want you to view your needs the same way after today's message let me quickly take you to the New Testament to the New Testament people needed physical healing the deaf needed to hear and the mute to speak and after Jesus performed a miracle in Mark 7 37 it says Jesus makes the death to hear and the mute to speak the blind needed to see and in Mark 10 verse 46-52 Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man a man had a withered hand and in Mark 3 1-6 Jesus healed that man's hand a woman had a blood issue in a mark 9 20-22 this woman had a blood issue for 12 years and she went behind Jesus and just touched his clothes and was healed some of you are having blood issues Vision issues hearing issues or some other type of physical sickness maybe you're like that woman you've had an issue for years and you're wondering can God heal me and the answer is emphatically yes Jesus Is A Healer Jesus he's not just a Healer he's your healer your needs attract the power of God Lazarus needed to be raised from the dead in John 11 Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead I love this story because it reminds me that nothing is too hard for God it doesn't matter how big the need is God is able your need isn't too big for God he's a God that brings dead things back to life again he can bring your life back to your dead body back to life he can bring back to life a dead marriage a dead family situation dead finances your need is not too big for God your need attracts the the power of God the disciples needed a miracle at their job and Luke 5 5-7 it's about some of the disciples they were professional fishermen and they were fishing on they caught nothing and they come back in and Jesus said go back out go into the deep Waters there's not supposed to be any fish out in the Deep Waters but they went out there and God did a miracle and they had caught so many fish that their boat began to sink some of you are struggling at your job and Jesus can perform a miracle at your workplace he can help you multiply your sales make your business soar he can give you favor with your boss or co-worker he can open doors for a promotion he can turn a horrible circumstance for your good your needs attract the power of God people were demon-possessed in Mark chapter 1 verse 23-26 it talks about a man who is demon-possessed and Jesus cast a demon out of here maybe you're wondering if you're demon-possessed or demon oppressed you need to know that the devil's power can stand up to God's power God can set you free from the grip the devil has on your life for every Christian greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world your needs attract the power of God the disciples were in a storm in Matthew 8 verse 24-26 the disciples were in a boat in a furious storm hit the lake waves swept onto the boat and the disciples they began to panic they thought they were going to die they were going down and Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves and the storm calmed down some of you are facing a terrible storm you're in a mental storm and can't sleep at night you're in an emotional storm facing anxiety and depression you're in a physical Financial or relational storm and you don't see any way out of it Jesus wants to calm your storm one word from Jesus can calm every storm in

opened doors for me to be a youth pastor at People's Church in Oklahoma City Jamie and I's marriage hit rock bottom after seven years and we needed a miracle to save our marriage and God restored healed saved our marriage Jamie and I we have a calling to be lead pastors and we had no clue what we were doing and God opened up the incredible doors for us to start People's Church Indianapolis eight years ago when we started people search Indianapolis we were meeting in a middle school Fall Creek Valley Middle School we were in the middle school for four and a half years and we needed a new building and in December of 2019 God opened the door for this building and we had no clue that about three months later the whole world was going to shut down Services shut down and listen once things open back up we may have never gotten back in the school we maybe had to wait a year or more but God met our need and he provided this building we were able to open up in June of 2020 and we've been growing ever since matter of fact what God is doing here in this bit it's a miracle it's a miracle y'all you can drive up and down 82nd Street all day long 24 straight hours and you got no clue there's a People's Church back here hidden in this office complex but you know what every week God is bringing people new families every week every week somebody's getting saved Revival is happening in the back of an office complex because God he meets us and our needs our needs attract his power of God and he's not done why because there's more people that need Jesus so we believe God's going to do another miracle he's going to give us a new building in a prime location to reach more people why because more people need Jesus we're going to start people's churches all around Indianapolis why because more people need Jesus they need a church where it's okay not to be okay they need a diverse Church they need a church that won't beat you down but it's going to pick you up and love you it's going to share the good news of Jesus Christ with you because our needs attract the power of God our needs attract power of God
DOA-WRVekF8,well the title of my message today is the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd look with me at Matthew chapter 2 verse 1 through 6. it says after Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod Magi from the East came to Jerusalem and asked where is the one who has been born King of the Jews we saw his star when it Rose and have come to worship Him when King Herod heard this he was Disturbed in all of Jerusalem with him when he had called together all the people's Chief priests and teachers of the law he asked them where the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem in Judea they replied for this is what the prophet has written but you Bethlehem and the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah for out of you will come a ruler who will Shepherd My People Israel Jesus was born to be our Lord Our Savior and Our Shepherd Jesus Is Our Shepherd this is such a beautiful analogy we are sheep and Jesus Is Our Shepherd and I want to give you three reasons we need Jesus the Good Shepherd three reasons we need Jesus the Good Shepherd the first reason is this is because the shepherd is our provider the shepherd is our provider the Bible uses this Shepherd analogy because a Shepherd provides for his sheep the shepherd leads them he guides them he feeds them he brings them water to drink he watches over them he protects them the shepherd he provides for the sheep sheep would not survive without their Shepherd they would not make it they would wander they would get snatched up they would starve they they would get lost they would not survive without their Shepherd and we need the Good Shepherd Jesus Christ providing for all of our needs we need him to lead and guide and to feed and to prevent protect and provide and I want to look at the famous Psalms Psalm 23 Psalm 23 1. it says the Lord is my shepherd I lack nothing God wants you to look to him to get all your needs met he wants to provide for you physically mentally emotionally relationally financially and God doesn't provide bad gifts he's a good God and he provide good he provides good gifts for your life but Psalm 23 describes it this way look at verse 2 it says he makes me lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside Quiet Waters God wants to provide Green Pastures for you not yellow molded old or calloused pastors he doesn't want to provide Barren pastures no no God wants to provide Green Pastures for you I'll be honest with you I am not very outdoorsy I am not uh one with nature maybe like others are you know how some people they are so one with nature that they just walk around outside barefoot all the time you know what I mean Barefoot on the grass and just always taking their shoes off and I'm just not one of those people but I I'll never forget when we move to Oklahoma and it was hot had some shorts on and and I had no shoes or socks and I remember the first time I went out of my backyard and stepped on my grass y'all it was like needles it was the coarsest sharpest roughest grass I I'm like this is hurting my feet I know some of my pastor you're weak well I am I'm weak-footed whatever you want to call me I got back on my porch I'm like that is the coarsest grass like I'm not lying down on that grass I'd be scraping up my arms and my body and what I found is that in Oklahoma they have Bermuda grass which is really coarse because it has to be because it gets so hot and so that was the first and the last time I went in my grass Barefoot but I'll never forget when Jamie and I moved back to Indianapolis we moved back in the summertime and we wanted to have a budget friendly date night and so we got some french bread got some Jam and some butter and we went to the Indiana Arts Garden we were gonna have a little picnic and I remember walking out there and there was just this this area this grassy area the Luscious greenest grass I have ever seen I remember touching it being like oh this grass is soft we don't even need a blanket I remember sitting down and I'm like oh man I could lay down and roll around in this grass it was I just laid there darling feed me some bread and some jam with some butter on it and we we had our it was Green Pastures I could have taken a nap in that nice soft grass that's what God he wants to have some green nice Indiana Arts Garden Grass not some coarse prickly you know scratch your grass he has Green Pastures he wants you to live in Green Pastures come on even in the middle of everything going on of inflation and high interest rates God wants to provide Green Pastures for you come on how do you know your job is not the shepherd your boss is not your Shepherd the economy is not your Shepherd interest rates and inflation are not your Shepherd the government is not your Shepherd the Lord is your Shepherd and scripture goes on to say not only does he make us lie down and greed pastures but he he leads me by quiet Waters God wants to provide you peace in the midst of all the noise and Chaos in life when you look to Jesus to be your shepherd He will provide peace and he'll lead you beside quiet and still water see God can give you peace in the middle of the storms of life as I look over my life there have been various years that were harder than others for various reasons and 2022 for a number of reasons has probably been one of the most challenging years I've had in life I've had more difficult conversations this year than I ever thought I would have there's been things and things that have happened and there have been challenges I never ever thought I would face or go through difficult conversations I never thought I would have to have and even though 2022 has been one of the more challenging years of my life I can tell you that I have had the most peace in 2022 and it's not because of me the peace is purely from the Good Shepherd that provides who's always there that will never leave me never forsake me doesn't matter how lonely I may feel or how alone I may be I've always had God right there by my side to talk to and pray to I'll be honest with you I don't know how I would make it through 2022 with the piece I've had without God to go to him and talk to him and pray and ask for his peace and so even though there have been more challenges there has been more peace and it's all because of the Good Shepherd he's a provider and he provides peace number two the third reason we need Jesus the Good Shepherd is the shepherd is our protector the shepherd is our protector the Bible says Jesus Is Our Shepherd because Shepherds Protected Their sheep when wolves came around to attack the Sheep when thieves came to steal the Sheep the shepherd was there with his Donatello staff well bam he would protect those sheep he guarded them day and night he would look that wolf right in the eye and that thief and he would say come on you want some of this and he would fight to everything he had to do to protect those sheep he was a protector and when you make the Lord your Shepherd Jesus becomes your protector and Defender no matter the attacks that come your way Jesus is your protector and one of the key ways Jesus protects us is by Leading and guiding Our Lives look at Psalm 23 2-3 says he makes me lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside Quiet Waters see the shepherd's a protector he will lead you away from disturbing Waters he'll lead you away from Troubled Waters he'll lead you away from floods that are going to make your life come crashing down and he'll protect you and lead you beside Quiet Waters it says he refreshes my soul he guides me along right past the Good Shepherd says no no that's the wrong path that's the wrong way come over here follow me I'm the Good Shepherd I will keep you on the right path I will keep you and your life and your family and your relationships and your money and your work I will keep it all on by Still Waters on the right path so when you look to Jesus to be your shepherd He will lead in God your life and he's a good god that'll lead you along right path see Jesus wants to protect you from going off on the wrong paths that will damage and bring Devastation to your life and so you need to listen to Jesus's voice the voice of the Good Shepherd and follow his leading look what John chapter 10 verse 2 through 4 says it says the one who enters by the gate is The Shepherd of the Sheep the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the Sheep listen to his voice he calls his own Sheep by name and leads them out some of you need to hear this today God knows you by name he knows you by name and he sees you God knows exactly where you are and he wants to lead your life but you gotta Look to Him stop looking to people stop looking to money stop looking to your job look to Jesus whatever you are facing in life Jesus wants to lead and guide you and verse 4 it says when he has brought out all his own if you're facing some trouble in your life today Jesus can bring you out you have to follow his voice it says he goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice see God not only wants to bring you out but then he wants to go ahead of you and lead your life I want to encourage you follow Jesus follow the Good Shepherd this Christmas season in 2023 follow Jesus follow his word follow his voice he will protect you and watch over you and lead you and guide you and get you by still and Quiet Waters and get you on the right path but you got to listen to his voice this is your moment this is your year say no matter what it takes in 2023 I'm blocking out all the noise and I'm listening to Jesus Voice come on you got to do the whole Hulk Hogan to Jesus oh it's not there no no where is Jesus I want to go where Jesus and when I hear Jesus and his word and what he says I'm going to follow him above any other voice because the Good Shepherd is a protector he'll watch over you he'll lead you on the right path he'll Lead You by still and Quiet Waters verse 4 it goes on to say this powerful truth about the shepherd is our protector so I'm 23 4. it says even though I walk through the darkest Valley we all face valleys trials and trouble says I will fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me if the Lord is your Shepherd he'll be with you and help you even in the midst of the darkest moments of Life there can be some dark valleys in life but the Lord will be with you he will comfort you he will help you he'll never leave you never forsake you he'll guide you even when you're facing evil situations you don't have to fear because the Lord is your protector even when your enemies are attacking you the Lord is your protector Psalm 23 5 it says you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies when the Lord is your Shepherd he'll protect you and he'll bless you in spite of your enemies he'll bless you in spite of their haters he'll bless you in the presence of your enemies when the Lord is your Shepherd he'll make your enemies watch your life being blessed your enemies will watch your family being blessed your kids being blessed your money being blessed your health being blessed your career being blessed your ministry being blessed your enemies will have to watch you being blessed and they can't do anything about it because the Lord your protector the Good Shepherd is the one blessing you they did they didn't give it and they can't take it away he's the one watching over you and caring for you and so they'll have to watch you being blessed come on somebody say the Lord is my shepherd the Lord is my shepherd in the number three third reason is the shepherd is our pursuer the shepherd is our pursuer Psalm 23 3 says he refreshes my soul he guides me along the right paths for his name's sake see when the Lord is our shepherd He guides our life in the wrong and in the right paths because it can be easy for us to get pulled on the the wrong path and so he pursues us he doesn't just let us wander off of a cliff he doesn't just let us wander into trouble or wander into a wolf pack or wander into a thieves car no no no no he's a good he is a pursuer he's constantly going after us to say no no go this way here is the right path and when the The Lord Is Our Shepherd that's how he guides us but come on sometimes sheep they roam away from the shepherd they start going down the wrong path and we can be a lot like sheep that just like sheep can roam away from the shepherd we can wander in Rome away from God that we can be cool with God but all of a sudden something catches our attention bad and we start wandering and God's like no come back over here Uncle okay sorry God trying to live for the Lord and we start getting impatient man we we wander and we're sheep and we get impatient and we don't want to wait and we want to start doing our own thing and we start getting into trouble and next thing you know bad we're wandering into troubled relationships and trouble at work and trouble with stress and trouble in our family in bad trouble if financially troubled emotionally and trouble at home because we wander and we Roam and the Bible talks about what God does when sheep wander away in Luke chapter 15 verse 4 and 7. the Bible says if a hundred sheep there are a hundred sheep and just one wanders away it says the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 to go find the one all it takes is one one sheep is gone he leaves the 99 and he goes and he's searching high and he's searching low he got his staff he's ready to fight wolves and thieves he's searching in the middle of the night into the early morning and he won't stop pursuing and he won't stop searching the search will never start until the one sheep that has wandered and has roamed away has come back he's looking and he's seeking see God pursues us when we wander away some of you you've wandered away and God is pursuing you today he loves you no matter where you wandered off to God loves you no matter where you find yourself today God is pursuing you no matter what you've done God is chasing you no matter how far you may be from God God is seeking after you and he's not seeking after you so that when he finds you he can beat you over the head with his staff and being like your stupid sheep come on back no no no no no no no no no God's not seeking after you to beat you up he's seeking after you to get you up he's seeking after you to pick you up and to carry you in his arms he's seeking after you to find you and to carry you and to put you on his shoulder to demand your wounds and to heal you and to help you he's not seeking after you to hurt you he's seeking after you to help you he's he's not seeking after you to to condemn you he's seeking after you because he wants to save you and to forgive you of all your sins he's a good Shepherd Christmas [Music] it's about God sending his son the birth of Christ a savior was born a good shepherd was born to save to heal to restore he's the Good Shepherd and he wants to be the shepherd of your life

wondering you're wondering will you ever get through it see when you're in the middle of a bad day you will wonder will this ever end anybody been there before i know i have and in the middle of your bad day i want you to remember one of jesus's final sayings on his worst day john 19 verse 30 it says when he had received the drink jesus said it is finished with that he bowed his head and gave up his spirit on jesus's worst day we're reminded that our bad days do come to an end but while you're in the middle of your bad days it's so important to understand that your bad days accomplish good things in your life they accomplish good things in jesus's life and they can do the same for you look at hebrews 5 8 it says even though jesus was god's son he learned obedience from the things he suffered jesus learned and developed from his bad days and god's plan is that you would learn and grow during your bad days that a bad day isn't just a bad day it's an opportunity for something better in your life that there are purpose in your problems there's purpose in your pain romans chapter five verse three through five it says not only so but we also glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering a bad day produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope and hope does not put us to shame because god's love has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit who has been given to us god's plan is to do a good work in you on bad days god wants to produce perseverance in you character and hope in you on your bad days but god's plan is also to do a good work through you on your bad days and when we steward bad days well god doesn't just do something in us he'll also do something through us to impact others see jesus bad day didn't just accomplish good things in his life it accomplished good things in our lives come on when jesus said it is finished the greek word is tetelestai this was a popular word in jesus's day when a when a a a worker when when completed his work at job when when there was a job they were working on or a project that they were working on when that project was completely finished they would say tetelestai it is finished when an artist put the last last bit of art the last stroke on his masterpiece he would look back and if he was done and the masterpiece was completed he would say tetelestai it is finished the work is finished the masterpiece is is finished and that day if you owed somebody a debt and you paid off that debt in full the the banker would stamp that debt to telesty it is finished the debt is paid in full how many i know it feels good when you have a debt that you pay off in full right it's a good feeling you know what i mean how do you know right now if you're still making payments on your car you don't own that car you're like what do you mean pastor stop making that payment and watch what'll happen you will be getting a phone call you don't own that car but when you pay off that car when you pay off all the debt on that card when you pay that last final payment it is yours it is finished to telesty and on the cross jesus paid our debt in full tetelestai it is finished and jesus purchased so much for us on the cross i want to go through today what jesus purchased for us on the cross number one is this jesus purchased our salvation in colossians chapter 1 verse 14 it says who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins hebrews 9 28 it says so also christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people he will come again not to deal with our sins but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him on the cross jesus purchased the forgiveness of our sins did you realize there is nothing you can do to earn your forgiveness except trust what jesus did on the cross he already purchased your forgiveness and salvation your salvation is not spelled due it's spelled done it was done it was finished on the cross jesus by his blood said tetelestai it is finished come on would you give him praise for his blood that was shed on the cross to forgive all your sins he purchased our salvation number two jesus purchased our relationship with god look at romans 5 10 it says for since our friendship with god was restored by the death of his son while we were still his enemies we will certainly be saved through the life of his son see because of sin humanity was separated from god but because the death of his son because jesus died a horrific death we could come near to god when you surrender your life to jesus you become a friend of god jesus purchased with his death on the cross our friendship with god the father tetelestai it is finished number three jesus purchased our freedom first timothy chapter two verse six it said he gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone see somebody today isn't living free you actually believe that you can't live free you believe that you have to be addicted to the drug the pill alcohol pornography sex gambling greed and lying and i'm i'm here to tell you today that that's a lie jesus purchased your freedom the bible says whom the son sets free is free indeed because of the work that jesus did on the cross you can live in freedom he said tetelestai it is finished number four jesus purchased our purity hebrews chapter 10 verse 14 it says it was a perfect sacrifice by a perfect person to perfect some very imperfect people by that single offering he did everything that needed to be done for everyone who takes part in the purifying process hebrews 13 12 it says so also jesus suffered and died outside the city gates to make his people holy by means of his own blood on the cross jesus did everything necessary to purchase your purity you can live free and you can live a life of purity not only did jesus purchase your purity but he sent the holy spirit to live inside of every person that surrender surrenders their lives to jesus and the power of the holy spirit it is living inside of you you don't have to live a life of sin you can live a life of purity and holiness and righteousness because jesus purchased your purity he shed his blood for your purity he said tetelestai it is finished number five jesus purchased our peace jesus purchased our piece isaiah 53 5 it says but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed jesus was punished on the cross to purchase your peace see you can have peace with god and the peace of god because of what jesus did on the cross come on somebody needs to hear this today no matter what you're facing in life no matter what you're facing with your children your job your family your finances no matter what you're facing with your health you can have peace jesus paid for your peace on the cross he said tetelestai it is finished peace is yours today receive the peace of god he he purchased it number six jesus purchased our healing first peter 2 24. it says he personally carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right by his wounds you are healed healing is available for you today because of the wounds jesus suffered on the cross he purchased your healing today mental healing is available to you emotional healing is available to you relationship healing is available to you today physical healing is available to you because of the stripes that jesus took on the cross you can be healed we serve a healing jesus he said tetelestai it is finished he paid for your healing number seven jesus purchased our blessings galatians chapter 3 verse 13 through 14 it says christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole the bible says he redeemed us in order that the blessings given to abraham might come to the gentiles through christ jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the holy spirit see jesus purchased all your past present and future blessings on the cross you can experience the blessings that god gave abraham because jesus paid for your blessings on the cross i would encourage you to study the the blessings of abraham this week because abraham's blessings are your blessings because of what jesus did on the cross he said tetelestai it is finished come on you are blessed i am blessed and there is no devil on earth that can stop me from being blessed and then number eight jesus purchased our victory let me give you two areas that he purchased our victory the first is you have victory over death because of jesus death on the cross you have victory over death first corinthians chapter 15 verse 57 it says but thank god he gives us victory over sin and death through our lord jesus christ come on as christians we don't have to fear death jesus conquered death hell and the grave and one day jesus is coming back for his church and we're going to live forever in glorified bodies come on we're going to be reunited with our families and friends that have died and our believers are christ we have victory over death because of jesus to telesty it is finished you have victory over death but then secondly you have victory over the devil colossians chapter 2 verse 14 and 15. it says he canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross in this way he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities he shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross come on the devil and his demons were defeated on the cross the bible says he disarmed them no weapon formed against you shall prosper you need to know because of the cross you have victory over the enemy you have victory over every demonic force that comes against you revelation 12 11 and it says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they did not love their lives to the death the blood of jesus gives us victory over the devil i thank god for the blood come on devil you have been defeated come on can somebody thank god for the blood of christ that purchased our freedom gave us victory purchased our salvation purchased us peace lord we thank you for the blood the blood of christ when jesus said it is finished to tell us die he did a work that only he could do a work that purchased our salvation purchased our peace purchased our healing purchased our freedom purchased our blessings and persia purchased our victory and so here just a moment we're going to take communion to remember and honor the sacrifice that jesus made for all of us
5WOrPdfwPtY,well today we're continuing our series called throwback where we look at some old testament heroes and there's so much we can learn from their lives and and what god did in and through them and the title for my message today is how to come back from a big mistake how to come back from a big mistake what do we do when we've made a horrible decision and your life is falling apart i know i've made some decisions in life that i regret what do you do after you've made the biggest mistake of your life and you're filled with regret and shame do you stop pursuing your dream what do you do after you've stepped out in faith to make your dream happen and you failed do you just quit how do you respond when you've worked so hard to build a family career a business a reputation and then you do something or say something and your world comes crashing down this is exactly where we find our old testament hero today his name is moses everybody say moses moses grew up in pharaoh's home he received the finest education moses was respected by all the egyptians all the israelites come on y'all remember growing up that michael jordan song i wanna be like mike i wanna be i wanna be like mike like mike well in the old testament they were walking around singing i wanna be like moses i wanna be i wanna be like my like moses i want like they were waiting for the new air moses to come out like i mean he was respected his future was bright but then he killed a man and fled to midian it appeared that moses's failure derailed his purpose forever that he would never become the leader he dreamed of becoming it looked like the mistake messed up moses the failure was final the decision destroyed his destiny and the past pain wrecked his purpose but moses made an incredible comeback after 40 years of living on the backside of the desert taking care of the sheep god's purpose for moses came to pass see your mistake may delay god's plan but it won't deny god's plan if you learn how to make a comeback no matter what you've done how horribly you've messed up no matter where you are in life no matter how bad things look you can make an incredible comeback and so today i want to give you two critical components to a comeback from the life of moses two critical components to a comeback the first component is this god specializes in comebacks you need to understand your amazing god he is a god of the comeback look at exodus chapter 3 verse 1. it said now moses was tending the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to horeb the mountain of god moses still went to the mountain of god even though he was a murderer see don't let your mistake your sin your mess-ups keep you from the mountain of god don't let them keep you from the presence of god see the devil he'll use your mistakes and failures to keep you from the mountain of god he'll try to shame you away from the mountain of god condemn you to keep you away from god's presence you messed up too bad you need to stop praying stop reading your bible you need to stop going to church you need to get your life back together and then maybe then you can even think about it but i'm sure they won't welcome you back you he's going to try to get you to stop this and stop that and i want you to know god says no no no no no no when you've messed up when you've blown it when you're living in sin you need to keep coming to the mountain of god you need to keep coming to church keep praying keep reading your bible keep worshiping the presence of god is critical to making a comeback is critical so look at exodus chapter 3 verse 2 and 4 it says there the angel of the lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up so moses thought i will go over and see this strange sight why the bush does not burn up when the lord saw that he had gone over to look god called to him from the bush moses moses and moses said here i am it's been 40 years since moses killed a man he's now a lowly shepherd living in midian over these 40 years there's no record of god speaking to moses god had been silent for 40 years not one sign that god was still with him not a glimmer of hope that he would ever return to egypt and fulfill his purpose moses has given up on his purpose and then a day at the mountain of god god shows up to moses in a burning bush god knew exactly where moses was and then god speaks to moses he calls moses by his name moses moses this had to be music to god's ear god sees me god knows where i am and you know my name i bet you when moses was leaving that mountain he was singing say my name say my name god called me moses moses moses moses they're like what you singing god still knows my name oh what a feeling to hear his name see people's church no matter what you've done you need to know that god knows where you are and he knows your name god hasn't forgotten about you god sees you in your place of obscurity failure brokenness shame isolation heartache confusion and pain the good news is this since god knows your name and he knows right where you are your failure is not final oh we ought to celebrate that today come on nudge your neighbor nudge your neighbor let him know your failure is not final with god failure is never final see failure is not the opposite of success is part of success god doesn't want to replace you because of your failure he wants to restore you your mistake doesn't disqualify you it can develop you because god is a god of second chances and god loves to take our mess and turn it into a miracle god specializes in the comeback he did it for moses he did it for abraham when he slept with hagar he did it for david after an affair with bathsheba and then killing her husband he did it for jacob who was a deceiver and a liar he did it for rahab the prostitute he did it for samson after he told delilah his secret of strength he did it for peter who denied jesus three times and he will do it for you because god specializes in comebacks look at acts 3 19 it says repent that means turn from sin then and turn to god keep coming to the mountain of god keep going to the mountain of god keep coming into his presence so that your sins may be wiped out and that times of refreshing may come from the lord god wants to give you times of refreshing he wants to give you a comeback repent and turn to god he specializes in comebacks let me give you the second critical component you need to encounter the presence of god you need to encounter the presence of god look at exodus chapter 3 verse 3 through 4. moses thought i will go over and see this strange sight why the bush does not burn up when the lord saw that he had gone over to look the bible says god called him from within the bush moses moses and moses said here i am see moses personally encountered god at the burning bush to make a comeback you need to have a personal encounter with the presence of god you can't make a comeback off somebody else's encounter with god you need to know the god's presence for yourself see some of you have experienced church but you haven't experienced the presence of god you've experienced organizations religion people and programs but you haven't experienced the presence of god and you can't make a comeback with somebody else's experience with god somebody else's worship their praise their faith somebody else's prayer life you need to experience the presence of god and one of the critical components to moses's comeback was his response to god's presence this is so easy to overlook but it's so key to his comeback he saw the bush burning but not burning up and he responded he went over he went closer and god took notice of moses responding he responded and the scripture says when the lord saw that he came close he called moses by name moses responded to god's presence and then god spoke to moses see responding to god's presence it is key to a comeback you have to respond to god's presence exodus 3 5 do not come any closer god said he then told him take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground notice moses responded again to the presence of god and the voice of god and he he took off his sandals see the presence of god is holy ground it demands a response people's church to make a comeback you need to learn to respond to the presence of god your response may be to take off something take off sin take off pride take off cussing lying filth take off porn take off the greed come on take yourself off social media you you have to respond to god's presence in god's voice let me give you some biblical responses to god's presence the first is this is standing in god's presence standing in god's presidence exodus 33 10 it says whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent they all stood and worshiped each at the entrance to their tent i think of a soldier standing attention that that standing is standing to say god you have my full attention i love standing in his presence at times with my eyes closed just trying to get in tune with god and his presence every one of my senses just focused on standing in his presence another response is singing in god's presence psalm 33 3 it says sing to him a new song y'all are coming out a little early praise the lord y'all i'm just going to bless y'all because you will be out here waiting a long time thank you so much so y'all can head back in i'll call you guys out number two hey but they was ready they was like hey pastor we about to take you to church just give me a couple more couple more points here a couple more points here number i'll bet you see number two is singing in god's presence they're like we're here but give me about five ten more minutes and we're gonna do that all right so number two is singing in god's presence psalm 33 3 it says sing to him a new song play skillfully and shout for joy sing in god's presence play instruments in god's presence shout in god's presence god's presence demands a response number three is clapping in god's presence psalm 47 1 it says oh clap your hands all you peoples shout to god with a voice of triumph come on can we clap for our savior today come on let's clap for jesus give it up for jesus put your hands together for the king of kings and the lord of lords the alpha and omega he's our everything he deserves the highest praise clapping in god's presence number four is dancing in god's presence psalm 149 3 it says let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel in heart number five is kneeling in god's presence psalm 95 6 come let us bow down in worship let us kneel before the lord our maker and then number six lifting your hands in god's presence psalm 134 2 it says lift up your hands in the sanctuary and praise the lord every sunday when you come to church you should respond to god's presence by lifting your hands psalm 63 4 it says i'll praise you as long as i live and in your name i will lift up my hands it's a it's a sign of surrender god's presence demands a response let me share with you what responding does four things that responding does number one is this responding to the presence of god will reveal god's character to you when you need it most exodus chapter 3 verse 6 and 7 then he said i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob at this moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at god the lord said i have indeed seen the misery of my people in egypt i've heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and i am concerned about their suffering see after moses responded to the presence of god god revealed his character to moses when he needed it most see moses was wondering god where have you been it's been a long time 40 years do you care about what i'm going through do you see how your people are suffering and god revealed his character and he said i am still god and i'm still in control i'm still the god of abraham isaac and jacob and i am concerned about my people moses i care about what's happening to my people and some of you you need to encounter god's presence so you know how much god loves you and cares about you i i get it you don't understand why you've went through so much it has been hard and it's been a difficult season for some your failure's and mistakes they're overwhelming you but god's presence will reveal god's character to you that he is holy that he is perfect that he's still in control he's loving and caring first peter 5 7 it says casting all your care upon him for he cares about you hear me today i'm not just talking about having a head knowledge i'm talking about responding to his presence all of your senses in tune and responding and worshiping and coming close to god when we respond to his presence god will reveal his character to us when we need it most number two responding to the presence of god will help you discover god's plan exodus 3 8 so i have come down to rescue them from the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of the land into a good and spacious land a land flowing with milk and honey the home of the canaanites hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites that's a lot of ites in god's presence god revealed his plan to moses see some of you desperately need to encounter god's presence so you can get god's plan church family don't miss 21 days of prayer starts today tomorrow we have our 6 to 7 a.m prayer and would you come on would you humble yourself would you set that alarm would you sacrifice some sleep and respond i'm telling you if you'll come at 6 00 am and you'll come and you'll pray and you'll respond to the presence of god at these prayer services god's going to reveal his plan for you his plan for your marriage your children your grandchildren your dating the plan for your career your business your money your future and your ministry matter of fact it was in 21 days of prayer i just remember it was in a season of 21 days of prayer where god just began to reveal that our time in oklahoma was going to be coming to an end and i had no idea what that was gonna look like or what that meant but it was in 21 days of prayer and we loved people's church we loved our time in oklahoma but god just began to stir listen we weren't even trying to seek his plan and he started to reveal his plan when we were at 21 days getting in his presence and responded i know some of you got some specific questions about the plan and he may have some specific answers but he knows your plan better than anybody else and when you respond and you come and you pray and you seek his face he may start even revealing some things to you that you didn't know you need but he knows that you need but that's going to come by responding got to respond to the presence of god it will help you discovers god's plan and then number three responding to the presence of god will give you directions direction exodus 3 10 the worship ban can come out now it says so now go i'm sending you to pharaoh to bring my people the israelites out of egypt moses encounter with god gave him clear direction for the next season of his life some of you are lacking clear direction for your next season of life god do i stay or do i move do i marry this person or not do i take the job or that job do i buy the house or not do i go to college or not do i talk to my spouse about this or not do i close the deal or not listen at our 6 a.m prayer services god he's going to give you some clear direction for your life and your future once we knew that that that god was the change was coming we then began to pray and it was through prayer it was through hours of prayer mourning prayer of seeking god where he began to reveal and and we wrestled and we didn't know and we went out on our own at times and we thought it was here and god's like no no no you're not hearing me so i'm just gonna be quiet while you're there we're like okay sorry god and so then we started talking and then all of a sudden indy came and we began as we began to pray god began to speak over and over and over and over again and it was through prayer that we're literally seeing that vision that direction come to pass right now there have been other times we need a direction for our family our kids decisions listen responding to his presence will give you direction and number four responding to the presence of god will give you confidence to move forward exodus chapter 3 verse 11 through 12. god gave him the direction but moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and bring the israelites out of egypt and god said i will be with you and this will be the sign to you that it is i who have sent you when you have brought the people out of egypt you will worship god on this mountain see after moses's massive failure he lost confidence he didn't think he could move forward and do what god was asking him to do anybody here you ever lost some confidence you messed up you made a mistake you tripped up you did something you thought you would never do and lost confidence could god ever use me would god ever use me see it was in god's presence where moses gained the confidence to move forward see church responding to god's presence will give you confidence you need to move forward listen we serve a god of the comeback and it doesn't matter what you've done or what mistake you've made god wants to give you a comeback he wants to help you listen that failure is not final and some of you today you've been pressing and you're back in church but you still lack some confidence you you're not really sure you still have some doubt in yourself and i believe just as god said to moses he's saying to you i'm with you i'm with you [Music] some of you need to receive that word from the lord today i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you i know you're scared i know you're worried i know what happened last time i saw the mistake i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you listen would you stand all across this room right now
xD-cj9ZIMWM,well today we are uh continuing our series called winning in our theme versus first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 it says don't you realize that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize so run to win god wants you to run to win not run to lose not run to just get by not run to just barely make it but run to win and in this series my goal is to teach you how to run to win in 2022 you can win come on look at your neighbor and tell them you can win you can win you can win you can win in your thinking and your habits your relationship your health your finances your friendships your career and with god and today i want to talk to you about winning in your relationships winning in your relationships when i was younger me and my friends we would play this game sometimes we played it at recess and it was called kill the carrier i know that sounds kind of violent it was a violent game and so let me play explain to you how this game went you had one football and let's say you had 10 of your friends okay and and you start off the game by somebody just throws the ball in the air or they kick it in the air and whoever catches the ball it now becomes everybody against them now you understand kill the carrier one guy has the ball or gal and the other nine are trying to kill them and they're trying to score a touchdown against the other nine people and what oftentimes happened was they probably felt like they got killed can you imagine getting tackled by nine people and every once in a while yeah somebody they they got bold they caught it and they were angry and they're like no you're not gonna get me and they're dragging one person they're dragging two but then the other seven come and they have no chance you know what i mean it was dog pile city i'll be honest with you i rarely caught the ball uh-uh i just waited for somebody else to catch the ball so that we there were not a whole lot of touchdowns scored in this game but if you're smart i i did score a time or two what you do is you wait for that time where the ball is coming really close to the end zone and you snatch it up real quick and jump into the because they can't touch you when you're in the end zone but then you have to try to go to the other end zone not many make it not many make it so every time you're tackled you throw up the ball and whoever catches it just this whole game it's like nine against ones dog pile city and some of you are playing your own version of kill the carrier you're trying to win by getting closer to god all by yourself and life keeps tackling you you're trying to win with good habits and solve relationship problems all on your own and you keep getting tackled you're trying to win and get victory over sin and an addiction and you keep getting tackled you're trying to win over worry and anxiety and depression all on your own and you keep getting tackled and here's the reason why you keep getting tackled the bible says in ecclesiastes chapter 4 verse 12 it says though one may be overpowered two can defend themselves a court of three strands is not quickly broken but it says one may be overpowered you can't win by yourself you will be overpowered life will tackle you your problems will tackle you temptation will tackle you disappointment will tackle you don't pick up the ball and try to run your life all by yourself you will get tackled some of you you are running by yourself but you have some friends that keep tackling you and piling on you you have some friends and every time you grab the ball and you try to run to win and run to score your friends six seven eight or nine of them they're tackling you and they're piling on you see having the wrong friends is just as dangerous is having no friends proverbs 18 24 it says there are friends who destroy each other see kill the carriers kind of a fun game when you're playing with your friends and all of that but it is not a fun game to be playing with life see some of you have friends that hope you stay addicted and high so you all can keep hanging out they hope you keep clubbing because they enjoy your company you don't even realize it but you have friends and their negativity they're lying their lack of integrity their greed their bad habits their bad business practices their bad spending habits their angle pro their anger problem keeps tackling you and you aren't winning in life because you keep getting tackled and piled on by your own friends and so to win in life you have to remove the wrong friends and you have to choose the right friends proverbs 12 26 it says the righteous choose their friends carefully listen to win in 2022 you must choose your friendships carefully you must choose winning friendships it won't happen by accident it's intentional you get to choose if you're going to win in 2022 because you choose your friendships and so today i want to show you what winning friendships look like i'm going to share with you three qualities of a winning friend this is what to look for and what you need to be and we're going to look at a story in the bible to discover these three qualities it's mark chapter 2 verses 2 through 5. it's as soon the house where he referring to jesus was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room even outside the door while he was preaching god's word to them four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat they couldn't bring him to jesus because of the crowd so they dug a hole through the roof above his head and they lowered the man on his mat right down in front of jesus seeing their faith jesus said to the paralyzed man my child your sins are forgiven and if you read on in verses 11 and 12 you'll see that because these friends brought this paralyzed man to jesus jesus also heals this man this man's life was changed forever because of his four friends and so the first quality of a winning friend is this winning friends help you through challenges winning friends help you through challenges this man had some serious challenges he was so severely paralyzed that all he could do was lay on a mat he's facing some challenges and his friends they got together they heard jesus was at this house and they said come on let's let's let's pick him up and let's take them and so they they grab each corner of the mat and they carry this man to the house but when they get to the house they encounter another challenge the building the house is so full that they cannot get in they can hear jesus in the distance but they cannot see him and i'm sure they even waited a second you know like anybody want to make some room you know we got my buddy here paralyzed and and i guess people are just so captivated by jesus nobody made any room and so they're holding this man they're carrying them they're looking at each other and then one of the friends looks up to the roof and he looks at his other friend you know what i'm thinking what are you thinking i think we need to carry him on the roof all right and so the fourth i wish i could see this like i would have sight it must have been four men carrying this paralyzed man up and they get onto the roof and they're like oh they ain't got no skylights friend looks down you know what i'm thinking what you thinking man we just gonna dig a hole in this roof all right it's not my roof and so they no so so they later they lay their friend down they're like man hold on one second and they start to dig and can you imagine that jesus is in there gee everybody's captivated and all of a sudden debris starts falling on can you imagine the owner of the house being like oh my what is what is going on and all of a sudden he sees a head pop looking down at him he's like call the police call call my insurance com people like what jesus he knows everything so he knew what was about i bet you jesus was just smiling debris just falling down and all of a sudden they're digging and they dig this hole and and and and and then you know i guess they could have dropped them because he was paralyzed right it probably wouldn't hurt but no these were good friends these were winning friends winning friends the bible says they lowered him down i can't imagine having to lower a human being slowly down through a hole in a roof to make sure that their friend got right at the feet of jesus these were some committed friends see challenging times will always reveal your true friends see the wrong friends are like shadows they follow you in the sun but leave you in the dark winning friends don't leave during challenging seasons that's one of the qualities of a winning friend the bible says in proverbs 18 24 it says there are friends who destroy each other but a real friend sticks closer than a brother's see winning friends they stick with you they don't leave you when an area of your life is paralyzed they stick with you when your spouse leaves you they stick with you when you're struggling with your parenting they stick with you when you're when when when you're when you lose your job or you're you're failing a class they stick with you when you make a big mistake or you're depressed or you get a horrible doctor's report or you lose a loved one real friends stick with you and winning friends don't just stick with you they also love you proverbs 17 17. it says a friend loves at all times see some people they'll stick with you during your challenging season but they'll tackle you instead of loving you you know what i'm talking about they stick with you but they're just negative bringing negativity and discouragement they're blaming you making fun of you and and and judging you you got here like i wish you weren't sticking with me but a real friend a winning friend they aren't focused on judging you they're focused on loving you they stick with you they love you but they are also are an emotional support for you during your challenging season the bible says in romans 12 15 rejoice with those who rejoice mourn with those who mourn many times as what's been described as a dog-eat-dog world people find themselves competing with their friends jealous of their friends success and accomplishments instead of rejoicing with their friends but winning friends they rejoice with their friends when their friends are being blessed they aren't tackling each other they are celebrating each other winning friends also mourn with their friends when life is challenging they have empathy they sympathize they care they listen to their friends most intimate thoughts feelings and struggles they don't just stick by you love you and are an emotional support but they also help you carry your burdens galatians 6 2 the bible says carry each other's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ winning friends help you carry your burdens just like these four friends helped carry the burden of their paralyzed friend they carried their paralyzed friend to jesus winning friends will help you carry the burdens of your life and they will help you without expecting anything in return come on that's a winning friend right there and so winning friends stick with you love you emotionally support you and carry your burdens do you have winning friends in your life are you a winning friend number two let me give you the second quality winning friends make you better winning friends make you better let me give you a couple ways they make you better number one is this they make you better because they believe in you these four friends they believed their paralyzed friend could walk again they believed that he could be healed they they wanted their friend's life to improve they believed that his life could be different they saw what could be not just was they believed this wasn't the end of his story that he had more of a life and a future and that jesus could heal him they believe that's what winning friends do see winning friends put wind in your sails not sink your ship they believe in you you need some friends that believe in your potential number two they make you better because they give you wise counsel they give you wise counsel proverbs 27 9 it says the heartfelt counsel of a friend is as sweet as perfume and incense see the counsel of a winning friend will sweeten your life not sour your life their cancel will sweeten your marriage not sour your marriage there it will sweeten your parenting not sour it it will sweeten your dating and friendships not sour it will sweeten your finances and career not sour it it will sweeten your integrity and reputation not sour it are your friends giving you sweet or sour counsel what kind of counsel are you giving and number three they make you better because they sharpen you proverbs 27 17 it says as iron sharpens iron so a friend sharpens a friend a winning friend sharpens your life they are sharp so they can sharp sharpen you they motivate you to be better my closest friends they sharpen me they sharpen me to be a better parent to be a better husband they sharpened me to be a better pastor and to be a better leader i thank god for my friends that sharpen me and make me better number four they make you better because they will speak the truth in love they will speak the truth to you in love see a winning friend will tell you what you need to hear not what you want to hear proverbs 27 6 it says wounds from a friend can be trusted see winning friends will offer sincere and loving correction when needed a casual friend they won't risk saying something that might upset you but a real winning friend they're willing to bring up issues because they have genuine concern for you they care and they love you they want to see you win and so they will speak the truth in love to you see we all have blind spots there's a me i can't see winning friends help point out your blind spots that are hindering and hurting your life you have to allow your closest friends to speak into your life see close friends will speak truth to you but won't gossip about you proverbs 11 13 it's as a gossip betrays a confidence but a trustworthy person keeps a secret a winning friend is trustworthy they can keep a secret they don't go around telling people about your blind spots and your secrets they help you not talk about you proverbs 16 28 it's as a troublemaker plant seeds of strife gossip separates the best of friends listen if someone will gossip to you they will gossip about you watch out for friends that are tackling you and then number five they make you better because they pick you up when you fall down ecclesiastes chapter 4 verse 9 through 10. the bible says two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor if either of them falls down one can help the other up but pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up see a winning friend will help you up not trip you up we all fall down we all have moments where life tackles us where life just piles on us and when you're on the ground the last thing you need are friends that are tackling you and piling on you you need some friends that will help you get back up i am winning in life today because i have friends that have picked me up when life has tackled me i have friends that have picked me up when life has knocked me down when life tried to knock me out for the camp i have friends that did not pile on they they didn't trip me up but that they helped me up and then number three number three the third quality of a winning friend winning friends keep bringing you closer to jesus these four friends they were determined to get their friend as close to jesus as possible that day they told their friend we're going to take you to jesus and so they grabbed a corner of his mat and they carried them to the house where jesus was and they get to the house and they can hear jesus but they can't see him wasn't close enough so they carried him up on a roof they started to dig a hole and as the hole started to form i'm sure at that point they could see jesus but seeing jesus wasn't enough and so they started to dig a hole and and kept digging they had to make it big enough because they were going to get their friend as close to jesus as they possibly could and so they then slowly lowered him and they they set down their friend right at the feet of jesus they were passionate they said i don't care what we got it we'll climb on a roof we'll dig a hole in the roof we are going to get our friend to jesus that's what winning friends do your friends are either bringing you closer and closer to jesus or pushing you further and further away from jesus there's no third option either your friends are bringing you closer to jesus or pushing you further away from jesus your friends will determine whether you win or lose in life your friends they influence they impact your life more than you probably realize you become like those you hang around look what first corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 says paul says don't do not be misled see this is an area we can get misled we think it's not a big deal oh it's all right they're not impacting me that bad they're not influencing my life that bad and paul says do not be misled bad company corrupts good character every single time bad company will corrupt good character you can love god you can be right on track with god but all of a sudden if you're if your closest friends are off track with god you will get off track too every single time listen if your friends live wild you will eventually live wild if your friends are undisciplined you will be undisciplined if your friends steal and are greedy and addicted dishonest gossip disloyal cuss lie and get drunk you will do the same if your friends slack off at work neglect their family or lukewarm having affairs sleeping around negative hateful mean and angry you'll be the same way proverbs 22 verse 24-25 it says do not make friends with a hot-tempered person do not associate with one easily angered or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared why should you not be close friends with a hot tempered people because you will eventually become like them bad company corrupts good character every single time show me your three closest friends and i'll show you your future and so i want to give you three quick applications today three quick applications the first is this disconnect from wrong friendships that keep tackling you and dog piling on you you got to disconnect from these friends you got to put distance and i can speak from experience there's times i've had to disconnect from some friendships that were tackling me dog piling on me and it wasn't easy but it was worth it some didn't understand some did it was hard it wasn't easy but it was worth it so somebody today you gotta you gotta disconnect from the wrong friendships number two intentionally connect with some

nu-gQZVGjcw,today we are going to look at Nehemiah and I've titled my message the title of my message today is stiff arm your way to Victory stiff arm your way to Victory if I want to be really cool I would have titled it stiff arm your way to Victor Ray all right if you wanted to go ahead you can tweet it however you want but that's the title of the message today and when we pick up in the story of the book of Nehemiah chapter one Nehemiah is receiving a report on the condition of Jerusalem the exiled Jews they've been in captive they've been set free they're going back to their city they're going back to Jerusalem they're returning to the city and Nehemiah is getting a report of the state and condition of Jerusalem when they return and so let's look at Nehemiah chapter one verse three through four it says they said to me things are not going well for those who return to the province of Judah they are in great trouble and disgrace the wall of Jerusalem has been torn down and the gates have been destroyed by fire verse 4 Nehemiah says when I heard this I sat down and wept in fact for days I mourned fasted and prayed to the god of Heaven see a city in that in that time a city with Broken Walls revealed a defeated people these Jews who had returned to their Homeland were both in unsafe conditions and and basically humiliated to be living in a destroyed City they were free but they come back to a city that's in shambles and the Bible says when Nehemiah gets these news he wept that for days he mourned he fasted he prayed like his home this city the place that signified God's favor was destroyed and in shamble this news that Nehemiah got this was gut-wrenching news knee buckling news take the wind out of your sale news and I wonder if any of us can relate have any of us gotten some news or encountered a circumstance or something happened in life that caused us to weep and mourn for days have you ever been hit by life so hard that it knocked you down that you felt like circumstances are tackling you maybe even today you feel weak defeated hopeless and helpless because what has been going on in your life maybe it's a sudden loss of a loved one maybe you got laid off or fired from your job maybe you just found out your spouse is being unfaithful or maybe you unexpectedly have received divorce papers maybe a child has cut off communication with you maybe you went in just for a regular checkup to the doctor and you got news of disease of cancer you got some bad news I I don't know what it may be but I think all of us currently right now are through life we go and something happens or we hear something and life just takes the wind out of ourselves it knocks us down we feel like we get we got hit by a Mac Truck and this is where Nehemiah is he looks around and he sees the rubble and the ruin the city defeated and destroyed but in Chapter 2 of Nehemiah he reveals that God put it in his heart to rebuild Jerusalem God put it in nehemiah's heart that it's not over this isn't the end of the story I'm going to rebuild what has been broken and destroyed and I believe God is saying the same to us today he's saying get up it's not over if you're still breathing he still has blessings if you're still alive he has a plan for you to thrive he's putting something in your heart saying don't give up Don't Quit I'm going to rebuild I'm going to restore however it's important for you to know that it won't happen without a fight see the moment you try to get back up the enemy is going to try to knock you down the moment you choose to get back in the game the enemy is going to try to tackle you and we have to learn to stiff Farm his attacks if you don't know what a stiff arm is I thought I would show you a tutorial a video clip so you can fully have your mind wrapped around what a stiff arm is check out this video boom now I know that happened fast so we're going to rewind okay to happen fast for some of y'all so keep an eye Colts is going to intercept the ball and here comes the enemy the enemy's coming after him and Shaquille Leonard says I don't think so oh that is what a stiff arm is when you try to get back up you try to get the ball back and get headed in the right direction the enemy is going to come and you got a stiff armor so today I have three attacks you need to stiff arm and I know some of y'all may not be football fans in here so for maybe some it's the same as talk to the hand so however you want to interpret it stiff arm talk to the hand but three attacks we need to stiff arm the the first attack is we need to stiff arm ridicule we need to stiff arm ridicule let's look at Nehemiah chapter 2 verse 19 it says but when sand ballot the horror night tobiah the ammonite official and jessum the Arab heard about it they had heard so again God put in nehemiah's heart that he was going to have him rebuild uh the the walls and the Gates of Jerusalem and so Nehemiah then went to the king and said hey would you bless them would you give us free passage and allow us to go and rebuild the walls in the city the king gave him favor God had put him in his heart and so he'd gathered the people and they had start rebuilding the walls but when these enemies sand ballot tobienjo when they heard about it the Bible says they mocked and ridiculed us what is this you are doing they asked are you rebelling against the king and so these guys are ridiculing Nehemiah they are they're talking trash they're trying to get into Nehemiah and the people's head to get them to quit before they even start come on who my trash Talkers in the room come on no I got some of you come on you're playing basketball you playing video games soccer Lacroix whatever your sport is come on where are my tracks you know who you are you're like oh I'll be talking some trash Oh yeah I get in their head before they yeah you lose the game before it even starts with some of that and so that's what they're trying to they're trying to talk some trash they're trying to get in their mind they're trying to defeat them before they even get started when you try to get back up and restore what's been broken when you choose to give up drugs or alcohol when you choose to get debt free when you choose to start losing weight and take back your health when you choose that you're going to decide to get back in church and serve and get in a small group and start tithing whatever it is you're trying to restore you will get ridiculed hold up you're trying to go back to school you are 40 years old come on now I think you missed your window it's a little bit too late for that man you should have raised your kids better if you would have raised them better they wouldn't be going through this it's too late there's nothing you can do your kids are helpless your marriage didn't work the first time what makes you think is going to work a second time what makes you think you can get a godly man or a godly woman I mean who is going to want to marry you like oh your baggage initiative ridicule what'd you do Sunday you went to church you they let you in that church you think church is going to help you yeah okay yeah good luck God good luck with this one yeah good yeah those of you listen treasure ain't gonna help you we going uh did it burn down I mean the Pastor know you were there they let you in and you will have people as you're trying to rebuild and restore and get on track you will have folks you're trying to overcome the odds they will start to ridicule you and when that happens you got a stiff arm ridicule you know what God has put in your heart doesn't matter what it all looks like he's put it in your you got a stiff arm ridicule you got a stiff arm the trash talking and then you have to start doing some talking yourself look what Nehemiah did look at his response in Nehemiah chapter 2 verse 20. I answered them they were mocking and ridiculing he said I answered them by saying the god of heaven will give us six you don't know what God put in my heart and you don't need to know the god of heaven will give us success we his servants will start rebuilding but as for you oh no talk to the hand you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it Nehemiah he's stiff arm the ridicule and he started speaking God's promises what God put in his heart God will give success we will start rebuilding see sometimes you have to give yourself a spiritual pep talk and the best way to give yourself a spiritual pep talk is with God's promises it's with God's word you may have to look in the mirror every morning and say man I may feel like a loser and I'm looking at marriage and kids and school and work and I feel like I'm losing but my God says I am more than a conqueror I'm going to stiff arm the ridicule and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hold on to the promises you may feel weak but you got to look in that mirror and say my God says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me you may feel defeated and you may have been defeated in some areas but you got to remember God said thanks be to God God gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ you got to remind yourself of God's problem of promises you got a stiff arm every bit of ridicule that comes and every day give yourself that spiritual pep talk God will he will he promised he said it and keep telling yourself that over and over and over again so they had to stiff arm ridicule and they Nehemiah gave a spiritual pep talk of God's promises but then another attack came the second attack you have to stiff arm is doubt you have to stiff arm doubt and so Nehemiah 4 10 it says then the people of Judah began to complain the workers are getting tired and there's so much Rubble to be moved we will never be able to build the wall by ourselves listen as you try to rebuild restore get back up you're gonna have to battle some doubt just some human nature where you're gonna can I really do this do I really have it in me do I really have have the strength and doubt is dangerous because it will it will stop us in our clock in our tracks a doubt is what we would call a deleter that's a tackle that not hits you so hard it knocks you out of your shoes and right now they're wrestling with doubt it's tackling them it's too much we can't we'll never we're tired you know what the enemy does when you start to have a little bit of Doubt oh he comes like a rushing wind he comes he wants to fan that flame of doubt and make it so strong that you give up and so while they're wrestling with the doubt if you read the story of Nehemiah now the enemy is coming and saying they're gonna attack and they're gonna go to war against them and so their doubt went from a little doubt to all of a sudden a lot of Doubt even if we could rebuild it we can't rebuild it and go to war and so doubt is all over them it's coming after them when you are trying to restore rebuild get back on your feet overcome a challenge overcome a tragedy there's an internal battle with our mind where we start to think we can never do what God promised we would do gout will doubt will come to to tackle you and the enemy will do all he can to feed that doubt see the mind being attacked by doubt is very dangerous because whether you think you can or can't you're right you're right and our mind is so powerful we start to believe what we think and so now they're thinking that they can't and and the enemy now is is pouring it on saying we're going to come attack you we're we're we're we're we're uh we're declaring war against you and so they're on the verge of being tackled and look what Nehemiah does in Nehemiah chapter 4 verse 13 and 14. it says so I placed armed guards behind the lowest parts of the wall in the exposed areas I stationed the people to stand guard by families armed with swords Spears and bows then as I looked over the situation I called The Nobles and the rest of the people and said to them don't be afraid of the enemy remember the Lord who is great and glorious and fight for your brothers your sons your daughters your wives and your homes y'all Nehemiah was a great leader in coach they're doubting they're worrying oh my gosh the enemies nehemiah's like a little we're gonna put some of you here you got some swords we're gonna put some of you here we're gonna have our tools and we're gonna have our swords and everyone listen up listen up remember the Lord remember the Lord and we're gonna fight we're gonna fight he helped them stiff arm the doubt and he starts cheering them on see one of the ways we stiff armed out is we have to surround ourselves with some nehemiahs if you don't have a Nehemiah in your life you need to get one quickly you need to get somebody that when you think you can't they're telling no no no no no yes you can listen to me remember the Lord he's great and he's glorious he's got you we will get through this no no no I'm not going to let you quit I'm not going to let you give up we need some nehemiahs in our life people that'll speak Faith encourages cheer us on people that will help you carry you people that will help you block the doubt see sometimes we don't have enough arms to stiff arm the doubt that's coming our way sometimes come on we need a Quentin Nelson we need a big cue if you don't know who he is Google them you see that boy running at you you are running out the way you need somebody like big Q in front of you paved in the way so that you can keep moving forward to what God has for you we need friends that will help us stiff arm the ridicule and doubt people that remind us God is for us that all things are possible with God's help if you can't tell I'm a big Colts fan big Colts fan last year our running back Jonathan Taylor he led the league in rushing yards I mean he is a beast all right fast strong I mean he hey he's stiff on you don't want one of his stiff arms but if you were to go to Jonathan Taylor and you would say man how did you break the the or how did you have the the single season uh rushing lead the league in rushing yards last season I guarantee you he wouldn't just talk about himself I guarantee you probably one of the first things he would do is talk about five people his offensive line he would say hey there were these five fellows in front of me that were blocking his opponents see on the football field there's 11 guys trying to tackle the guy with the ball and there's absolutely no way Jonathan Taylor would have had the season he had without those Five Guys blocking for him matter of fact the Colts were in a game they were facing the Patriots you could say they were facing the devil if you want I mean it's very similar we'll just call him the enemy I got love for you Patriots fans we love you but and the Colts were winning but then the Patriots started coming back and it's like oh man here we go and I guarantee you I know as a Colts fan doubt started to creep into my mind see some of y'all shaking your head I think maybe even on the side some doubt was creeping into Minds it looks like they were coming back looks like great they're going to come back and they're going to beat us with Jonathan Taylor he had his five let me show you what it can do for you when you have when you have some people that are helping block and pave a way for you let's check out this clip right here boom okay so look Jonathan Taylor just got the ball if you don't know who it is look at that hole y'all that hole is there because a big old 79 or I don't know what the 70 something 56 that's big Q if you didn't know 56 Quinton Nelson you got the old line you got the tight end you got all of them all those Patriots they are coming to tackle Jonathan Taylor listen life is going to come in the enemy is going to come to tackle you with doubt and you need some people on the front lines with you willing to block every attack that's coming your way so that you got a hole to step into God's future and his plan that he that he has for you so that you can score that touchdown and so look what happens when you got people helping you block the way for you come on let's play the rest of the clips oh oh I don't even think he got touched the 40 the 30. the 20. the 10. touchdown Jonathan would tell you he scored that touchdown because of his blockers I know he had a juke move too so every once while you may have to Juke somebody but his blockers were there in front of them listen this is the number one reason you need to get in a small group if you aren't in one you need to get some blockers you need to o-line around you you need to get a team around you stop doing life alone matter of fact down the lobby we got people holding up signs they say what is your passion listen here at People's Church we want to help you lead a small group around your passion whatever your passion is would you lead a small group would you get around would you get in a group with some others that y'all can help each other stiff arm the doubt and the attack of the enemy sometimes you don't have enough hands to stiff arm all the attacks and you need a team and one of the best places to get that is in a small group before you leave today would you sign up to go to one of our trainings we will show you how easy it is to lead a small group around your past whatever your passion is and what's your problem my passion is fishing great would you start a small group some of you your passions the colds great but you mean I can do a small group around the Colts game absolutely make sure you're at church all right but then yeah go ahead I'll Pastor I won't be at church me and my small group are going to be watching Colts games don't you do that all right let me just make sure you're understanding what I'm saying but whatever it is your passion's food to a small group around food your passion is a Bible or certain book in the Bible do it do a leader smoker if your passion is women single moms if your passion is kids if your passion is parenting if your passion is men and helping men serve God and be good Dads and good husbands whatever your passion is would you lead a small group to help make a difference because we are better together Jonathan Taylor is better together he's better with that old line that he is without him we are better with you leading a small group than we are without you leading a small group and they will help us stiff arm all the doubt that comes our way so stiff arm ridicule it's deformed out they're getting closer they built the walls and all they have left to do is put in the gates but the enemy did not give up the enemy tried to tackle them one last time and so here's the third thing you have to stiff arm distractions stiff arm distractions look at Nehemiah chapter 6 verse one through nine it says Sam ballot tobiah gesture of the Arab and the rest of our enemies found out I had finished rebuilding the wall and that no gaps remained though we had not yet set up the doors in the gates throw on the home stretch it says so Sam Bala and Justin sent a message asking me to meet them at one of the villages in the plane of oh no but I realized they were plotting to harm me so I replied by sending this message to them I am engaged in a great work so I can't come why should I stop working to come and meet with you and so they're about to finish and here come the distractions verse four four times they sent the same message and each time I gave the same reply verse 5 the fifth time the relentless sand Ballard's servant came with an open letter in his hand and this is what it said there's a rumor among surrounding Nations and guess up tells me it is true that you and the Jews are planning to rebel and that is why you are building the wall according to his reports you plan to be their King he also reports that you have appointed prophets in Jerusalem to Proclaim about you look there's a king in Judah you can be very sure that this report will get back to the king so I suggest that you come and talk it over with me distractions threats and lies oh my and Nehemiah just kept stiff arming him left and right verse 8 I've replied there is no truth in any part of your story you are making up the whole thing they were just trying to intimidate us imagining that they could discourage us and stop the work so I continued the work with even greater determination Nehemiah just stiffed armed the distractions left and right and they kept building and if you if you continue to read in Nehemiah in chapter 6 verse 15 you read that on October 2nd the wall and the gates were finished listen it's the home stretch and here come a multitude of distractions and when you're on your home stretch when you're getting closer they're going to be many distractions different angles and ways and shapes and forms and people you're going to think you're good and it could even cause you to be like whoo I made it I'm almost arrived but listen you got to know the enemy is still chasing you and you cannot get distracted you have to stiff arm the distractions let me let me show you how this works I'm going to show you a video and uh you're gonna it's it's the bills and cowboys and Frank Reich our coach was the quarterback y'all if y'all see him apologize to him for what I'm about to show y'all but but let's go ahead and let's watch this clip right now oh he fumbles and then Leon he's like I'm I'm getting my victory and there's the devil you see him 82 you see the enemy he don't even see it he doesn't even see it he got distracted oh that's what happens that's what happens you think you're good you got distracted and the enemy is chasing you oh he had look at him he's like what happened oh you had to do all he had to do was hold on to that ball Don Bibi not tackling that big boy stiff arm to once and he would have scored but he got distracted see the same will happen to us when we get close the enemy of our souls he will not concede Victory but as long as we're protecting ourselves and we're stiff armoring him he's fine he's defeated but he will fight to The Bitter End to try to trip you up to get you the fumble we have to bear down push through stiff arm every distraction we have to use the same Proclamation that Nehemiah used we are engaged in a great work and you're not going to distract me I'm engaged in God's work and

Ca19fcFmMgo,"well today we're continuing our series called own it and uh we've talked about over the last couple weeks own your life own your relationship with God own your relationships with people and own your mental and emotional health and today I want to talk to you about how to own your mistakes this week I was thinking about all the mistakes I've made in life i' I've made a lot of mistakes in my 43 years of living and I started to think about what are some of the biggest mistakes I've made in life what are my top 10 biggest mistakes in life and to be honest with you was hard to think of 10 not because I was good but because I've done a lot of wrong I've made a lot of mistakes in life but as I started to think about man what are some of my top 10 biggest mistakes you know one is I started drinking alcohol and getting drunk at 16 years old and throughout High School another one is I started looking at pornography in Middle School another was having sex in high school another was just thinking about often how when I was younger just being disrespectful to my parents and deceiving my parents another is in my mid to late 20s uh got in a massive amount of credit card debt another one of my biggest mistakes was just first seven years of my marriage I was very I was verbally abusive with Jamie I would uh tear her down with my words and it did a lot of damage in our marriage and caused a lot of challenges those first seven years another one of my biggest mistakes are have been times when I put Ministry I put work before my family before my kids my marriage another one of my biggest mistakes is just times where I've lost control of my anger with my kids another one I when I was a youth pastor in Oklahoma City I the youth ministry grew very large and had to hire some staff and I wasn't a very good boss I was impatient I was too driven at times harsh um and then uh the last one biggest one of the biggest mistakes I was I was just not a very good Big Brother uh to my younger siblings I was not a great uh role model in my younger years and I've made so many mistakes I have blown it so many times and if the truth be told today we've all made some big mistakes come on look at your neighbor tell them you ain't fool of me I know you made some big mistakes come on go ahead tell them you ain't fooling me ah know you made some big mistakes we all have you've made mistakes in your marriage dating parenting friendships you've made mistakes at school at your job in your finances and in your health and here's the question how should you respond when you've made massive mistakes what do you do when you're suffering incredible pain consequences because of your mistakes and feel like you can't move forward in life and so today I want to preach from a very familiar story in the Bible about a young man who made a lot of massive mistakes it impacted his family his friendships his finances it impacted his entire direction of his life and the Bible talks about this son who went to his wealthy father and asked asked for a share of his father's estate he was basically was saying to his dad I want to pretend like you're dead I want my inheritance now I don't want to wait till you die he was basically saying you're dead to me I want my inheritance now I don't want you in my life anymore and the Bible shares how the father gave this selfish son his inheritance the young man left his father and his family and he went to a distant country he no doubt hurt his father and fractured relationships with his family because of his actions he then became friends with the wrong people he was partying living wild and he spent all of his inheritance on wild living he ran out of money and then the Bible says a famine hit the country and so this young man was now flat broke he couldn't take care of himself he was barely eating he was so so hungry that he went to work at a pig farm to try to make enough money to eat a decent meal but he was still barely eating he's hurting he's hungry he's so hungry the Bible says he wanted to eat the pig slot as he was feeding the pigs he was so hungry he wanted to eat the pig food he was in a bad place he was suffering the pain and consequences of mistakes what do you do when your mistakes have you hurting and suffering and experiencing horrible consequences how do you own your mistakes so that you can move forward in life first thing is this you have to own admitting your mistakes own admitting your mistakes look at Luke 15:18 this is that young man he says I will sit out and go back to my father and say to him father father I have sinned against heaven and against you this young man admitted his mistakes he admitted his sin he didn't blame anyone else he didn't justify his actions he owned his mistakes it takes both humility and courage to admit your mistakes in our image driven culture so many people are focused on protecting their image that it stops them from admitting their mistakes people want to post their best picture the filtered picture the picture where their marriage and their kids and their dating relationships look so happy come on have you ever seen one a couple they post something on social media and they're all smiling and oh I just we just love each other look like they have oh man a that so awesome they love each other what a great vacation they had and then two months go by and they're divorced and you're like what what you're thinking what in the world happened I mean they look so happy on those vacation pictures see those pictures weren't reality it was all about image versus reality and so many people live every day like this way that that they don't own their mistakes because they want everybody to think that they got it all together they try to fool the people who know them the best they lie to themselves and try to make things seem better than they really are they're all about protecting their image versus admitting their mistakes they don't admit that they've been neglecting their kids they've been a horrible parent they don't admit that their anger is out of control they're yelling controlling impatient they're a jerk to people they don't ad admit that they're lying to co-workers family friends eroding trust day by day that they're gossiping and backbiting and destroying people with their words they don't admit that they've made stupid decisions and now their marriage is falling apart they don't admit that they're upside down financially driving a nice car but broke as a joke they don't admit that they're full of Pride and don't listen to anybody and when people don't admit their mistakes they never learn from them they never grow from them the consequences only compound the first step to learning growing and improving your life after you've made a mistake is to admit your mistake John Maxwell said a man must be big enough to admit his mistakes smart enough to profit from them and strong enough to correct them but you will do the you will never do the last two until you do the first one and that's to admit your mistakes number two on knowing where you are and how you got there on knowing where you are and how you got there let's look back at Luke 15:17 the Bible says when he came to his senses he said how many of my father's hired servants have food to spare and here I am starving to death this young man came to his senses and he didn't try to make his situation better than what it was no no he owned where he was and how he got there he sinned and that's how he ended up in a pig pen starving to death he knew he had to own it go back home and apologize because he had messed up big time he knew he heard his father and his family see often times people make mistakes and they don't own where they really are they try to make things better than what they are is not that bad I mean I know I hurt my spouse but they'll get over it I know I don't listen to what my kids are thinking or their feelings and just yell at them but our relationship is great I know I lied a few times but I'm try trustworthy I know I don't follow through with my assignments at work but people know my heart and I deserve the promotion I mean I know I spent our savings on a new car and didn't tell my spouse but our marriage is great she'll be over it in a week or two you will never learn and grow from your mistakes if you don't own where you really are and how you got there you can't pretend that things are better better than where they are if your mistakes have you in the pig pen own where you are how you got there no more excuses no more blaming no more arguing Own It Own It number three on seeing how your life can be different on seeing how your life can be different in verse 18 this young man said I will go back to my father's house he was saying my mistake have got me in the pig pin but my life can be different I don't have to spend the rest of my life in this pig pin listen your mistakes don't have to ruin the rest of your life they don't have to define the rest of your life but you got to start seeing the future can be better than your past your life can improve and be better and this isn't easy when you've made a massive mistake that has you in the pig pen of life sometimes you feel like there is no way out of the mess you made your life is in shambles you can't ever recover from your mistake but the devil is a liar listen you serve the god of the comeback you serve a God who gives a second third fourth 100th 1,000th chance but you got to start seeing how your life can improve and be better you have to see yourself getting out of the pig pin the worst place to be in life is to have your physical sight but to have no spiritual sight where you can only see yourself in the pig pin for the rest of your life listen if you can't see yourself getting out of the pig pin then you won't get out if you can't see see your life getting better then your life will never get better you can't go back and change the beginning but you can start from where you are today and change the ending no matter where you are in life no matter how big the mistake was with God you can have a comeback and live a better life number four on taking the steps to change your life Luke 15:20 the the Bible says so he got up and went to his father this young man didn't stay where he was he didn't stay in the pig pin he got up and he started the journey back home he started taking steps in the right direction listen to own your mistakes and start moving forward in life you got to get up and you got to start taking steps in the right direction come on tell your neighbor get up and start taking steps in the right direction come on just tell them right now get up and start taking steps in the right direction well Pastor it's not worth my time to start taking steps in the right direction it's too late things are just too bad it is what it is I'm destined to live a pig pen life no stop saying that no no no no no no no no no look look just because things may not change overnight or in a week or two or in a month or two or in a year or two doesn't mean they won't change things didn't change overnight for the prodical son what brought his change was the fact that he started taking steps in the right direction and eventually his life changed and your life and circumstances will change and get better if you start taking steps in the right direction come on get up and get out out of the pig pen none of you were called to live in the pig pen of Life Proverbs 24:16 it says The Godly May trip seven times but they will get up again I know you've tripped and made some mistakes but I'm here to tell you to get back up stop living in shame and get up stop living in regret and get up stop making excuses and get up stop feeling sorry for yourself and get up stop letting your mistakes Define you and get up and start taking steps in the right direction and then number five on receiving the grace and forgiveness of God The Prodigal Son started his journey home his head hung low filled with shame guilt he has already rehearsed his apology he is ready to receive the consequences and the punishment he deserves he doesn't feel worthy to be his father's son he deserves to just be a hired worker back in his dad's house and I want us to read the father's response to his son who's blown it look at Luke 15: 20 through 23 it says so he got up and went to his father but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him the son said to him father I have sinned against heaven and against you I am no longer worthy to be called your son but the father said to his servants quick bring the best robe and put it on him put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet bring the fatten calf and kill it let's have a feast and celebrate listen when you've made the biggest mistake of your life your heavenly father is still full of compassion grace mercy and loves towards you listen somebody needs to hear this today God God loves you God has grace and mercy for you God is for you stop rejecting his grace and mercy stop rejecting the ring and the robe and the seat at his table stop punishing yourself and receive the grace of mercy of God and then have Grace on yourself stop beating yourself up and get yourself up listen the very moment you went to God and asked him to forgave you he did he did now forgive yourself and don't allow the opinions and words of other people to stop you from living in the grace and mercy of God come on how you know some people they love to keep bringing up your past and throwing them in your face Pastor Herbert was sharing a story of how uh there was a a a member of people's Church in Oklahoma City one of the their co-workers knew Pastor Herbert back in we woke up when he was before he was a Christian and living wild and crazy and uh they told that that attender they said oh yeah I will never go to your church I knew Pastor y'all this was 30 years ago that was back in 1991 like man he's been saved people are being changed through his church but man I'm just telling there were people they will throw your past mistakes in your face and The Prodigal Son he dealt with the same thing and so will you look what his brother said look at look at Luke 15:28 the Bible says the older brother became angry and refused to go in so his father went out and pleaded with him look at verse 30 it says but when the the the brother said but when this son of yours man weren't even his brother anymore when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home you killed the fattened calf for him the older brother wouldn't celebrate the fact that his younger brother's life had changed he wanted to keep bringing up the past listen there will always be haters there will be people that don't want you to move past your mistakes they want to see you punished over and over and over again they don't want you or they don't want God to bless you with a robe a ring and a party but don't let the haters stop you from forgiving yourself and from receiving your heavenly father's forgiveness and blessing listen truth be told none of us are worthy of God's forgiveness none of us deserve God's mercy and Grace none of us deserve to be blessed by God but thank God for Jesus thank God for the cross thank God for the blood thank God for the resurrection of Jesus Christ that changes us saves us forgives us and heals us listen we don't earn God's forgiveness and blessings by our good works we receive them by faith through the grace of God found in Jesus Christ you've made some mistakes but because of Jesus you're blessed you've done some things you're ashamed of but you're blessed you've done some things you regret but you're blessed today receive God's grace and mercy and forgiveness and forgive yourself get out of the pig pin and move forward in your life I want to close by reading our theme verse for this series Philippians 2:12 it says work out your salvation with fear and trembling you have to work out your salvation with fear and trembling trembling listen nobody's going to work it out for you nobody's going to work it out for you you have to own your mistakes and work them out with fear and trembling on admitting your mistakes on knowing where you are and how you got there on seeing that your life can be different on taking steps that can change your life and on receiving the grace and forgiveness of God listen today is your day to get out of the pig pin and move forward in life"
9yKgh8bJZXo,"so last Sunday we made a huge announcement and if you missed last Sunday let me tell you what our great God is doing right now we are leasing 30,000 square feet of this building but God has opened an unbelievable door for us to purchase the entire building which is 58,000 square feet and 5.19 Acres amen so we're going to be able to purchase that for $3.2 million and that's $55 a square foot we did a comp study of the area and buildings around here are selling for 75 to 80 a square foot our building payment for a 58,000 square foot building is going to be right at the same payment that we are currently paying to lease 30,000 square fet of the building incredible also there's 7200 squ F feet of the building that is currently it's being leased and it's going to be leased out for the next nine years to a company and the contract is written in a very favorable way for us we will receive $6,600 a month and by the end of the 9-year contract the the company will be paying us $8,100 a month so we will generate monthly Revenue which will lower our building payment so we can buy the building for under market value have a cheaper payment than what we're paying to lease the building and the great news is is we are going to be able to expand our Auditorium for more seats we're going to be able to build out our kids space a bigger Lobby so that we can reach more people for

ask God and as we give God's going to do a great work I would love for us to have less than $2 million of debt on this building which would mean we would need to give 772 th000 between now and June 17th and I just believe our God can do it amen I believe he can do it as we pray as we ask as we give matter of fact I'm asking God for a miracle I'm praying every day between now and June 17th that

it's all about that's what it's all about so we are we are fired up and excited uh for what the Lord is going to do well today uh we're continuing this series called stay in your lane and the title of my message today is turning your pain into purpose turning your pain into purpose we're in this series series called stay in your lane and throughout the series we've been studying the life of David and learning the key ways that we prepare for what God has prepared for us and last week Pastor Herbert talked about how David prepared for his purpose by passing the adversity test and one of the tests that we briefly talked about and I want us to dive deeper into today is the family and friends test we talked about how family friends and people in general can hurt and wound Us and how you handle hurt wounds hatred and betrayal of people will either prepare you for your purpose or will hinder your purpose your response to that pain will either prepare you for your future or postpone what God has for your future and so many people they miss out on their god-given purpose because of their wrong response to pain instead of allowing pain to develop them they allow it to destroy them and David didn't allow pain to destroy him and he experienced Unbelievable pain from several people and he stepped into his purpose because he had the right response to pain let me show you the pain that David experienced from King Saul King Saul attempted to kill David 14 times in 1 Samuel 1811 two times Saul threw a javelin at David to kill him in 1st Samuel 1817 Saul was plotting to get David to marry his holdest daughter and was hoping oping it would lead him to fighting against the Philistines and being killed in 1st Samuel 18:25 through 27 Saul wanted David to marry another one of his daughters and David decided to marry her so Saul told him the price to marry his daughter was 100 Philistine forkins he wanted David to be killed fighting the Philistines in Samuel 19:1 Saul tells his attendants and his son to killed David in 1910 Saul throws another Javelin at David in 1911 Saul sent Messengers to David's house to kill him in 1920 Saul sent men to capture David no doubt to have him killed in 1921 Saul sent more men to capture David and then in that same verse he sent even more men to capture David in verses 22 and 23 Saul pursues David in Samuel 23 24-2 Saul and his men pursued David in Samuel 241 and2 Saul took 3,000 men to search for David and then in Samuel 26:2 again Saul took 3,000 men to search for David to kill him some believe that Saul pursued David and tried to kill him somewhere between 13 to 15 years that is a long time to be running for your life David had to deal with years of hatred schemes lying and deception matter of fact Saul ended up becoming his father-in-law and still wanted him dead that's another level of hatred and betrayal and it would have been easy for David to allow hate resentment bitterness to grow in his heart but David's response to Saul is mindblowing it shows the heart of an incredible man of God on two occasions David had the opportunity to retaliate and kill King Saul look at 1st Samuel 24: 3-7 it says he came to the Sheep pens along the way a cave was there and Saul went in to relieve himself David and his men were far back in the cave the men said this is the day the Lord spoke of when he said to you I will give you your enemy into the hands for you to deal with As You Wish then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe afterward David was conscious stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe he said to his men the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed or lay my hand on him for he is the anointed of the Lord with these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul and Saul left the cave and went his way David spared this evil King's life but he didn't just do it once he did it twice look at 1st Samuel 26 through verse 7-10 it says so David and abashi went to the Army by night and there was Saul lying lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head Abner and the soldiers were lying around him abashi said to David today God has delivered your enemy into your hands now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear I won't strike him twice but David said to abashi don't destroy him who can lay a hand on the Lord's anointed and be Guiltless as surely as the Lord lives he said the Lord himself will strike him or his time will come and he will die or he will go into battle and perish after all that King Saul did to David it's pretty amazing that David didn't kill him I know some of y'all you would have saw that spear knead his head you oh yeah you want to throw some javelins at me huh bam you would have ended it but not David David had a deep trust in God he believed God will deal with King Saul and not only did David not kill King Saul but years later he decided to bless his crippled grandson 2 Samuel 9:1 David asked is there anyone still left of the House of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake and we find out that Saul still had a grandson alive named mbth and so in 1st Samuel 9:7 David says to mbth Don't Be Afraid David said to him for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul and you will always eat at my table David didn't allow the crazy e outlandish behavior of King Saul to destroy him he allowed it to develop him he allowed it to drive him closer to God he allowed it to prepare him for his purpose listen most of us don't have people pursuing us and trying to kill us but we all experience pain from people and my question question is how are you responding to the pain of people the friend who betrayed you the family member who abused you on this Mother's Day you're dealing with the pain of a child who won't talk to you the spouse who walked out on you the parent who neglected you the people who t talked about you it's not easy to deal with the pain of people it's hard it can make you feel sick to your stomach it can cause sleepless nights it can make you angry it can cause you to grieve what you used to have it can make you numb and coldhearted it can make you jaded and critical of people I I remember a season when I was betrayed by a close friend it almost destroyed me it was one of the most painful Seasons I've gone through in life I was angry I was hurt I was bitter and listen I got on the other side of that season by applying the biblical truths I'm about to teach you I was able to turn my pain into purpose to allow it to develop me instead of destroy me and today I want to teach you how to turn your pain into purpose your wounds into wisdom I want your pain to prepare you for your purpose I want it to develop you not destroy you and so here are five ways to turn your pain into purpose five ways to turn your pain into purpose number one is this pray for those that hurt you pray for those who hurt you this sounds like a cute sweet little cliche but praying is one of the most profound things we can do when someone has hurt you I I would go as far to say that all the other points hinge on this first point Jesus said this in Matthew 5:44 but I say to you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you these are some strong words from Jesus love your enemies and pray for them Pastor I don't want to pray for them I want to punch them I want to give them a piece of my mind I want to fire off an email and tell them off I want to go on social media and put them all on blast and let the world know what an idiot they are I want to cut them not pray for them no no no no no no before you do anything pray before you do anything pray and it's okay to pray honest prayers God doesn't require you to check your emotions at the door when you pray he wants you to be real to be honest to be vulnerable pray angry pray sad pray upset pray confused yell cry cry be frustrated God can handle all of your emotions he's like Keep It Coming keep it coming I can't have you going off on anybody like that keep it coming keep no do keep it he you can give it to them all be real with God be honest with your prayers the key is to pray to your heavenly father because prayer will eventually soften your heart prayer will help you see that person the way God sees them prayer will help you overcome a bitter heart Hebrews chap 12: 14-5 make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy without Holiness no one will the Lord it takes prayer to live holy and a part of Holiness is not living with bitterness see to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no Bitter Root grows up to cause trouble and defile many listen you don't want a Bitter Root to grow in your heart so go to God In Prayer don't let that Bitter Root get in your heart and and grow bitterness always grows prayer is like weed spray you got them weeds popping up on your driveway your sidewalk get you some of that round up y'all remember Round Up Just spraying them weeds and killing them with that's what prayer does the bitterness that's in your heart it's weed spray to get all that witness bitterness and get all that roots to kill the roots of bitterness don't allow the roots of bitterness to grow because they will only cause trouble in your relationships your healthy relationships will become toxic if you have a bitter heart it's not easy to work through the hurt pain and wounds of people but if you will pray and keep on praying you will experience free Freedom let the pain develop you instead of destroying you and if you will pray it'll help you do Point number two forgive those who hurt you forgive those who hurt you Matthew chap 6 verse4 and 15 it says for if you forgive other people when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive forgive others their sins your father will not forgive your sins forgive so you can be forgiven forgiveness is not optional if you want to be in a right relationship with your heavenly father and if you want your heart to be healthy listen forgiveness doesn't mean what the person did isn't a big deal but it does mean your relationship with God is a big deal it does mean that protecting your heart is a big deal forgiveness doesn't mean you have to have a relationship with the person but it does mean you value your relationship with God forgiveness doesn't mean you excuse what the other person did forgiveness prevents their behavior from destroying your heart someone once said holding a grudge doesn't make you strong it makes you bitter forgiving doesn't make you weak it sets you free forgiveness is a gift that you give to yourself and understand that forgiveness is a choice not a feeling you may wake up for weeks and months and have to choose to forgive even though you don't feel like it when I was dealing with that betrayal from a friend I was wounded I was bitter I was angry y'all I didn't feel like forgiving I didn't feel like they deserve forgiveness and I didn't I had I had some feelings towards them but it was not forgiving them and I realized I can't keep living with unforgiveness it was destroying me in my relationships even though I didn't feel like it I woke up every day for months and chose to forgive my feelings were saying don't forgive but my words and actions chose forgiveness and eventually my feelings followed my daily Choice forgive so that the pain develops you instead of destroying you number three is this talk to the person not about the person Look what Jesus says in Matthew 18 verse 15 and 17 talking about conflict talking about what happens when we there's someone hurts us it says if another believer sins against you go privately and point out the offense if the other person listens and confesses is it you may have you have won that person back but if you are unsuccessful take one or two others with you and go back again so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three Witnesses if the person still refuses to listen take your case to the church then if he or she won't accept the church's decision treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector let's break this down number one go privately the very first thing you do is you go privately and you talk to the person so many people problems could be avoided if people went to the person first and talk to them but people violate this biblical principle all the time and it reeks havoc in their relationships talk to people not about them and talk to resolve the problem don't go talk to be right don't go talk to prove a point don't go talk to be evil or mean Ephesians 4:31 it says get rid of all bitterness rage anger harsh words and slander as well as all types of evil Behavior avoid bitterness avoid rage and anger watch your attitude avoid harsh words avoid slander don't make stuff up don't embellish the truth avoid evil Behavior go talk to the person to resolve the situation if you don't get the situation resolved the Bible says then take one or two godly people with you and again you don't go to other people and talk about the person you don't put it on social media or in a group text take one or two people with you and go talk to the person and and then if the situation doesn't get resolved the Bible says then go to church leaders that could be your small group leader or a pastor get their wisdom and counsel have them meet with you in the person and if that doesn't resolve the situation the Bible says then treat them like a pagan what does that mean that means listen you've done all you can do you can move on as Jesus said you can shake the dust off your feet and you can move on you've done Romans 12:18 which says as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone you did your part move on number four number four do good to the people who hurt you when someone hurt you your feelings will tell you things like hurt them back get even retaliate cut them but Jesus teaches us there's a better way to respond a way that honors God and invites blessings into your your life Matthew 5:44 but I say to you love your enemies bless those who curse you and do good to those who hate you the Jesus way is not look for opportunities to get even but look for opportunities to do good Romans 12:14 bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse Romans 129 through 20 do not take revenge my dear friends but leave room for God's wrath for it is written it is mine to avenge I will repay says the Lord don't take revenge allow God to repay on the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink in doing this you will heat burning coals on his head if you do good to people who hurt you the Bible says you will Heap burning coals on their head see people who hurt you they love to argue fight yell scream and act like a fool and they can't stand it when you don't play their game when you bless them instead of fight with them it annoys them it makes them look foolish it makes them reflect on their evil Behavior it makes them have to deal with the shame of how they've mistreated you but the most important thing is you are being like Jesus when you bless those who persecute you and when you honor God God will honor you and God will fight for you number five number five the fifth way let God heal your heart let God heal your heart church family God cares deep when your heart is broken Psalm 34:18 it says the Lord is close to the Brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit I love the way the message uh uh says it it it says if your heart is broken you'll find God right there if you're kicked in the gut he'll help you catch your breath if your heart is broken God is right there he wants to help you catch your breath that's why you need to go to God In Prayer God wants to help you and heal you David said in Psalm 30:2 he said Lord my God I called to you you for help and you healed me David allowed God to heal his heart listen if you don't heal your heart you will bleed on the people who didn't cut you you will bleed on your family you will bleed on your friends you will bleed on people at work and at school and people don't enjoy being around you if you're always bleeding on them you you've heard it said that hurt people hurt people and it's true and when you don't let God heal you you take it out on your family and friends those closest to you receive punishment they don't deserve hurt people hurt people but healed people heal people let God heal you so that he can turn your pain into purpose your misery into Ministry get healed so you can go heal so you can go minister to others who are hurting but in order to do that you got to let God heal your heart you got to pray you got to you got to pray for those that hurt you you got to forgive to break off the root of bitterness again you forgiving it's a gift to yourself it's not allowing what they did to damage your heart and you got to let God heal you you got to let him heal your heart"
eAbAUGUmekw,we're in the middle of our series about the Holy Spirit and I told you this week I would be sharing with you the number one reason your fruit is not going and so the title of my message is the number one reason you're not growing and last week we talked about the fruit of the spirit it was part one if you missed last Sunday please go to our YouTube Page search people search Indianapolis watch part one on our message on the fruit of the spirit but we learned that at Salvation the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of every Christian and he brings all the fruit of the spirit with him but the fruit of the spirit comes in seed form it just doesn't come as an apple it comes as an apple C all right it comes in seed form the baby stage and it needs to grow and be developed in your life First Peter 1 23 it says for you have been born again not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the living and enduring word of God the fruit of the spirit it's in seed form the baby stage and you and I needed to grow First John 3 9 it says no one who was born of God will continue to sin because God's seed remains in them they cannot go on sinning because they have been born of God John says that when the Holy Spirit and his seed of the Fruit of the Spirit come to live inside of you at Salvation there will be change in your life because the holy spirit's job is to produce his fruit in your life but the problem is your flesh always wants to do was contrary to the fruit of the spirit and when you first become a Christian your flesh is stronger than your fruit because your flesh has been leading your life for years and now the goal is for the fruit to grow in your life so that you stop following your flesh and you start following the spirit the the fruit in the flesh they're at war with each other you remember them little cartoons where someone's standing and they got like the little devil with the Pitchfork on his shoulder and then on the other shoulders like God or an angel or something that's what's going on here there's a battle of the of the the fruit and the Flesh and they are at War and the stronger one will win in your life look what Galatians chapter 5 verse 16-23 says it says so I say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh for the flesh desires what is contrary to the spirit and the spirit what is contrary to the flesh they are in conflict with each other so that you are not to do whatever you want but if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law the acts of the flesh are obvious sexual immorality impurity debauchery idolatry and Witchcraft hatred Discord jealousy fits of Rage selfish ambition dissensions factions and envy drunkenness orgies and the like I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace forbearance kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control against such things there is no law I posed this question last week and I'll pose it again is your life producing the acts of the flesh or the fruit of the spirit what's growing in your life flesh or fruit what's winning in your life flesh or fruit what's controlling your life flesh or fruit and last week we learned about the first five characteristics of the fruit of the spirit there are nine characteristics of the fruit of the spirit last week we hit the first five let's just review those again so number one was love love is not only the first characteristic but it's also the motivation for all of the other eight the Greek word for love is agape agape love is the highest form of love in the Greek language it's selfless sacrificial pure form of love next was joy in a world full of Sorrow anxiety depression worry we can have joy from the Lord that only comes from the Holy Spirit and joy is something that a lion a lot of Christ followers are chasing after rather than allowing the Holy Spirit to produce inside of them the Holy Spirit wants to produce joy in your life number three is peace is being in the midst of trouble pain heartache hard work loss lack disappointment or grieving and having a calmness in your heart next we talked about patience patience is the ability to suffer to wait to endure with a good attitude there are many things you can only receive in the kingdom of God by developing the fruit of patience and then lastly last week we covered kindness we live in a cruel mean hateful and hostile world and God wants to produce kindness in the hearts of the Christ follower he wants our life to look different than the world and so now let's look at the last four characteristics of the fruit of the spirit next is goodness everybody say goodness some would probably think that kindness and goodness are the same but the Bible shows us that they're different yet they are also connected see kindness is eternal it's an attitude but goodness is external it's an action it's in your heart to be kind and then your kind heart leads you to do good for others as Christ followers Our Lives should be marked by goodness we should be known by our Good Deeds Jesus said in Luke 6 27 but you who are listening I say love your enemies do good to those who hate you Titus 2 14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify eager to do what is good Romans 12 21 do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good Ephesians 2 10 for we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do the Holy Spirit wants to produce goodness inside of you next is faithfulness everybody say faithfulness faithfulness is a quality that's lacking in our world and in the church a lot of Christians are known for not being Dependable or reliable not being a person of their word saying one thing and doing another lacking commitment lack follow-through quitting people struggle people are struggling with faithfulness they're not faithful to their spouse their children their family not faithful to their job their friendships their academics not faithful to their church or in their relationship with God Holy Spirit help People's Church be a place that is known for our faithfulness First Corinthians 4 2 it says moreover it is required of students of stewards that they be found faithful Revelation 2 10 do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer I tell you the devil will put some of you in prison to test you and you will suffer persecution for 10 days be faithful even to the point of death and I will give you life as your Victor's Crown no matter how hard it gets be faithful to Jesus Matthew 25 21 the master was full of Praise well done my my good and faithful servant you have been faithful in handling this small amount so now I will give you many more responsibilities let's celebrate together my prayers on Judgment Day we would all hear well done my good and faithful servant the next characteristic is gentleness everybody say gentleness how many of you would describe yourselves as gentle you know good I'm glad there's a couple of you you know because I think gentleness is overlooked you know what I mean I think more of us should aspire to that but here's the here's the problem there's a common misconception is it's that gentleness is weakness that gentleness is passiveness people will run over me if I'm gentle but that's just not the truth biblical gentleness is just the opposite it requires great strength to be gentle nothing is so strong as gentleness and nothing so gentleness as real strength gentleness and it's it's birth out of a humble heart Look what Jesus said Matthew 11 29 take my yoke upon me and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls Jesus wasn't weak or passive Jesus was strong and he was gentle and humble gentleness comes from a heart of humility if you lack gentleness you lack humility prideful people aren't gentle they're easily angered they're rude they're mean they're harsh doesn't take a whole lot of strength to be mean rude or harsh but it takes a lot of strength to be gentle we need the help of the Holy Spirit for gentleness and God wants to develop gentleness inside of you that is birth from a humble heart look at Ephesians 4 2 it says be completely humble and gentle be patient bearing with one another in love second Corinthians 10 1 by the humility and gentleness of Christ I appeal to you Philippians 4 5 let your gentleness be evident to all Titus 3 2 to slander no one to be peaceful and considerate and always to be gentle toward everyone God help us Holy Spirit help us be gentle and then the ninth characteristic is self-control everybody say self-control a husband asked his wife when I get angry you remain so calm how do you have such self-control she said I just go clean the toilet he said well how does that help anything she said I use your toothbrush [Music] water right there that husband had to pray for some gentleness do you did what with my toothbrush someone once said I am great at telling myself to stop my bad behavior it's the follow-through that needs work there's a lack of self control and some of you today don't believe you can have self-control in your life you believe that you have to be addicted you have to keep doing your bad habits that you have to get drunk get high look at pornography overeat abuse the pills have a hateful time you have to be a workaholic spend hours a day on social media you're like Pastor I just can't stop no no no no no no that is a Lie from the devil that he wants you to believe the Holy Spirit wants to help you have self-control to control your emotions and desires he wants to develop self-control inside of you second Timothy 1 7 it says for God gave us a spirit not a fear but of power and love and self-control Titus 2 11-12 for the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people it teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled upright and godly lives in this present age first Peter 4 7 it says the end of all things is at hand therefore be self-controlled and sober minded for the sake of your prayers Watchman niece said this he said we must have the spirit of power towards the enemy the spirit of Love towards men and the spirit of self-control towards ourselves Holy Spirit produce self-control in US in my prayer is that your fruit will grow and develop if your fruit is in the seed or the baby stage I pray it develops to the child stage if your fruit is in the child stage I pray that it develops to the teenage stage if your fruit is in the teenage stage I pray it develops into the adult stage if your fruit is in the adult stage I pray that it will develop to the senior citizen stage so let me ask you what's stopping your fruit from growing why have some of you been a Christian for years and your fruit hasn't gotten out of the baby stage I'm share with you the number one reason today hey next week I'm gonna share with you the number two reason number two reason why your fruit isn't going don't miss next week but right now let me share with you the number one reason that the scriptures that I'm going to read you are all about how to produce fruit look with me at John chapter 15 verse 1 through 10. Jesus says I am the True Vine and my father is the gardener he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit well every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful you are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you remain in me and I also remain in you no Branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me I am the vine you are the branches if you remain in me and I in you you will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing if you do not remain in me you are like a branch that is thrown away and Withers such branches are picked up and thrown into the fire and burned if you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you this is to my father's Glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples as the father has loved me so have I Loved You Now remain in my love if you keep my commands you will remain in my love just as I have kept my father's commands and remain in his love 11 times in that passage Jesus says to remain everybody say remain some of you your fruit isn't growing because you aren't remaining you're not remaining in Jesus so your flesh is winning the battle your flesh is growing and your fruit is staying small First Peter 1 14 so you must live as God's obedient children don't slip back come on some you slipping you slipping don't slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires you didn't know any better than stop slipping back into your old life remain stop slipping back to old friends and old habits and remain remain and grow remain and produce fruit remain so that your fruit grows stronger than your flesh we got to remain let's let me give you nine ways I'm gonna go through them quickly nine ways if you're taking notes get your thumbs ready we'll get your pen or pencil ready nine ways to remain so your fruit grows number one is this remain in the word John 15 7. if you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you you gotta read the word of God every day not just when you feel like it every day

Drawing Near you need church every week success starts on Sunday in God's house every single Sunday it can't be optional for you your kids and your teenagers you got to be here every Sunday you need

corporate worship but also in small groups you have to get in a small group and remain in a small group not just for a few months not just one time I visited I said hello not just when people aren't on your nerves you got to remain connected you got to remain meeting together with other believers number five you have to remain in serving look at First Peter 4 10. it said each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms come on get to growth track and get on the Dream Team some of you you aren't seeing your fruit grow because you think growth is all about taking in past I need you to feed me feed me feed me bless me bless me feed me feed me bless me listen but if all you do is take in and you don't give out

remain and serve number six remain in generosity First Corinthians 16 2 on the first day of every week each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income saving it up so that when I come no collections will have to be made some of you have never started giving to God get started giving every paycheck give to God first if you're giving take the next step and start tithing the tithe is the Baseline some of you used to tithe but you haven't remained the key to your growth is not starting and stopping the key to your growth it's remaining remain generous number seven remain in the love of God John 15 9 as the father has loved me so I have loved you now remain in my love God God loves you just like you are the Bible says while you were a sinner God loved you remain in the love of God number eight remain in the pruning process John 15 1-2 Jesus said I am the True Vine and my father is the gardener he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful some of you have stopped growing because you don't want God to discipline and prune you but the Lord disciplines and prunes those he loves come on allow God to keep pruning away area is in your life so that you can be more fruitful this is where I see a lot of people give up this is where I see a lot of people stop they're excited they're fired up about God and then all of a sudden the Bible gets in their business all of a sudden the word of God begins to correct all of a sudden the word of God and their life doesn't start this is where I see people they're like oh oh that hurts Oh Lord You're touching an area that I'm not ready for you to touch and you stop the pruning process and listen I know it's painful I've had God prune some things in my life but can I tell you when I let him prune it his word says it will allow you to do more and more fruit when you stop the pruning you stop the growing you got to remain remain wrestle pray you gotta fight your flesh your flesh is not going to give up easy your flesh is not just gonna surrender oh I give up no it's gonna cry and scream and fight it's gonna try to justify and you got to remain remain remain in the learning process and then number nine remain in obedience John 15 10 Jesus said if you keep my commands you will remain in my love just as I have kept my father's commands and remain in his love listen you don't obey to get saved but you do obey because you are saved in the context of what Jesus is talking about is your life bearing fruit and if you want to bear fruit you have to keep his Commandments you can't deliberately keep living a life of sin or keep deciding that you're not going to remain in God's word and in prayer and in church and in small groups that you're not going to remain in serving in generosity in the love of God and pruning in obedience listen if you don't remain your fruit will not grow you got to remain in every single area your love your joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness faithfulness self-control if you don't remain it will stay in the baby stage your flesh will control you and it will lead

forward to meeting with you well today we are starting a brand new series called ridiculous and the title of my message today is don't be ridiculous has anybody ever told you don't be ridiculous let's see a show of hands here anybody ever been told don't be ridiculous okay i didn't see every hand go up so why don't you just look at your neighbor right now and go ahead and tell them don't be ridiculous come on tell them right now don't be don't be ridiculous i know i've been told that a time or two and the phrase don't be ridiculous is found in first samuel chapter 17 verse 32-33 david is talking with king saul david has come on the scene and has realized that the israel army has been stuck in their tracks they have frozen in fear by this giant named goliath and it says don't worry about this philistine david told saul i'll go fight him don't be ridiculous saul replied there's no way you can fight this philistine and possibly win you're only a boy and he has been a man of war since his youth don't be ridiculous a number of years ago we went to a lake with some a number of friends and uh one of our friends had they had jet skis sea doos and i've i've never ridden on a jet ski or a sea doo and so i was really excited and the families were all taking turns and our family was the last one to go and every family went on there they were going crazy on that thing i mean they were getting going as fast as they could and then were just they were just whipping it and they were throwing each other off of the the sea i mean it was just crazy you just see bodies flying into the water and i'm like i ain't doing i ain't doing that i'm just thinking that to myself and then the next family gets up same thing [Music] and they're like oh awesome it's awesome you're like chris are you gonna whip it don't be ridiculous i mean i'm like no i think i'm good they're like come on goodbye you need to do it my wife was like babe just ride with me if you know my wife she is adventurous oh man do not get on a sea-doo with jamie she'll have you flying 50 feet in the air i mean she was she got on that thing she was like whipping whipping people off of it people are skipping off the lake and i'm like i'm like they're like come on your wife is doing it i mean they're trying to put peer pressure on me i'm like listen i got a family to raise i got a church to lead i got like don't be ridiculous the reality was i was playing it safe i was like i want to worship on the sea dude i just want to go at a nice speed and i'm just going to take in god's creation so y'all better believe i got on that cd oh our god is isn't awesome they're like chris whip it whip it he rains on heaven me take a long slow turn it i probably could have whipped it y'all but i was playing it safe a brother was playing it safe i wasn't trying to whip it or get whipped off and you know in the last 20 months there's been this giant of covid and all the division around it racial tension political polarization it has caused a lot of christ followers to play it safe with their faith they're not allowing god to do anything ridiculous through their life they're not dreaming big praying big believing big and moving forward with big faith they're playing it safe and david didn't play it safe when he encountered that giant he believed god for big things he was dreaming so big the king told him don't be ridiculous come on david look he's a grown mazer soldier you ain't nothing but a shepherd boy and i'll go fight him you know who my god i mean david was he but he had faith in his big god king said don't be ridiculous church would people hear your dreams and say that's ridiculous see so many of god's people aren't believing god for anything ridiculous they're dreaming small dreams praying small prayers lord bless the food and erase all the calories lower my pinky toe been hurt touch it lord lord i'm tired lord can you just give me a front parking spot at the walmart entrance today like we just little prayers and like the israelite army they were stuck many of god people they are stuck in the valley of elah for 40 days and 40 nights the uh the the army of israel allowed this giant to keep them stuck in small thinking and small faith and some of you today you find yourself stuck in the valley stuck in small thinking small dreams stuck in reasonable thinking stuck in excuses stuck in being comfortable stuck in bad habits in sin stuck with little faith living in fear stuck living in intimidation and today and throughout this series god is going to help you get unstuck since and to start living with big faith in a big god i believe through this series listen don't miss one week i believe god is going to give us bigger faith than we've ever had before that we need to have big faith in a big god and so i want to start off by giving you three things the giants of life want you to believe number one is this the giants want you to believe there's no way god can do big things through your life no way god could do big things through your life look at first samuel 17 33 don't be ridiculous saul replied there's no way you can fight this philistine there's no way you can those five words paralyze so many people from having ridiculous faith there's no way you can over the last 20 months with cobid we have been told what we can't do we can't go out to eat we can't go to movies can't go on the cruise the hospital can't go to the nursing home and restaurant and hear me i'm not complaining we have all had to navigate the season the best that we can but your spiritual enemy the devil he is magnifying this season and he's telling you what you can't do i'm hearing god's people pastors leaders talking about what they can't do the devil has people believing you can't dream big you can't believe god for big things you can't believe god will intervene in your situation you can't get free from addiction you can't be healed you you can't get over depression and anxiety you can't get the degree you can't live for jesus you can't own your own home you can't be debt-free you can't have financial peace you can't be a multi-millionaire you can't start the ministry you can't start the business oh you can't get promoted you can't get a better job you can't have a thriving marriage you can't raise godly children you can't ever come back to church and worship you can't be faithful to church you can't lead a small group you can't do anything big for god and listen i'm telling you right now today god wants to kick the i can't spirit out of your mind and out of your heart listen we do not serve a god of i can't we serve the god of i can philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me you can you can come on say it with me say this with me with god oh i need a little more conviction just a little bit more conviction say with god i can with god i can let me give you the second thing the giant wants you to believe he wants you to believe that you can't win first samuel 17 33 don't be ridiculous saul replied there's no way you can fight this philistine and possibly win and the devil is telling you you can try it but it won't work you can't win you're going to lose go ahead and try and watch how you fail see giants can make you feel like a loser they can suck your faith right out of you and the devil is trying his best to make you have a losing mindset instead of a winning mindset see through the natural eyes i mean saul was right david was going to lose i mean goliath was a giant david was average size goliath was a man david was a boy goliath was a trained soldier david was a shepherd boy goliath had armor and a spear david had a slingshot and no armor but david didn't allow the giant or king saul to suck his faith out of him he was full of big faith in a big god i'll go fight him and some of you you are allowing the words of people and giants to suck your faith out of you you're listening too much to the words of your giant and not enough to the words of your god romans chapter 10 verse 17 it says so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god what some of you need to do today is you need to hear the promises of god so you can get full of faith so you can have a winning mindset let me help you out here deuteronomy 28 3 it says you're blessed in the city blessed in the field blessing your coming in and going out romans 8 28 says all things work together for good romans 8 31 if god is for us who can be against us second peter 1 3 says his divine power has given you everything you need for life and godliness jeremiah 29 11 i know the plans i have for you plans to prosper not to harm you to give you a future and a hope joshua 1 9 be strong and courageous do not be afraid do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go isaiah 54 17 no come on no weapon form no weapon formed against you will prosper psalm 91 7 a thousand may fall at your side ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you psalm 118 17 i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord psalm 23 the lord is my shepherd i lack nothing philippians 4 19 and my god will supply all my needs according to his riches in glory in christ jesus second corinthians 9 8 it says and god is able to bless you abundantly so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work come on some of you are getting filled with faith right now psalm 27 13 i remain confident of this i will see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living psalm 84 11 the lord bestows favor and honor no good thing does he withhold from those who walk is blameless psalm 34 10 the lions may grow weak and hungry but those who seek the lord lack no good thing mark 11 24 whatever you ask for in prayer believe you've received it and it will be yours psalm 37 4 take delight in the lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart come on in somebody's faith rising up as you hear those promises let your faith rise up start believing believing and dreaming and praying your best days are ahead of you believe bigger dream bigger pray bigger pray bigger number three giants want you to believe that you don't have what it takes first samuel 17 33 don't be ridiculous saul replied there's no way you can fight this philistine and possibly win you're only a boy see the devil uses giants to make you believe you don't have what it takes god can use somebody else's ridiculous faith but not yours god can do big things through someone else but not through you he wants you to believe you're too young you're too old you're you're a millennial a gen z a gen x baby boomer no no no god can't use you you're too poor you're too rich you're too white you're too black you're too brown see giants they they want us to doubt and believe we don't have what it takes giants speak to your insecurities you're just not enough you've made too many mistakes why would god use you who do you think you are anyways you are small and your giant is so big see too many christians get focused on their giant and they lose sight of who they are in christ first samuel 17 33 don't be ridiculous saul replied there's no way you can fight this philistine and possibly win you're only a boy and he's been a man of war since his youth you can't because you're a nobody and your giant is a somebody and church i want you to know today you are not a nobody you are a somebody you need to hear what god says about you first peter 2 9 it says your chosen people royal priesthood holy nation you are god's special possession psalm 139 14 you are fearfully and wonderfully made second corinthians 5 17 you're a new creation all things have passed away all things become new deuteronomy 28 13 you're the head not the tale romans 8 37 you're more than a conqueror first john 4 4 greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world romans 8 38 nothing will separate me from the love of god isaiah 43 4 you're precious in god's eyes romans 8 2 you're free from the law of sin and death first corinthians 2 16 you have the mind of christ john 15 15 you're a friend of god john 15 16 you've been appointed to bear fruit ephesians 2 10 you're created to do works and john 1 12 you're a child of god listen you are a somebody because you're a child of god you're a child of the king when the enemy tries to tell you you're a nobody you remind him who your father is and that because of your father you're a somebody you're chosen you're called you're appointed you got to remember who your father is you're a somebody you're somebody and god wants to do ridiculous things in it through your life he wants to give you a ridiculous faith and so i want to give you three steps to see god do ridiculously big things in your life first step is this you must keep believing in spite of what you see and hear got to keep believing in spite of what you see and hear and so first samuel again the king's telling him don't be ridiculous you're just a boy he's a man of war look what it says in first samuel 17 34 it says but david persisted david didn't allow the giant or king saul to cause him to stop believing god for big things no no he persisted he kept believing he kept saying i can see david didn't see a problem he saw potential see to god to see god do ridiculous in your life you have to keep believing in spite of the giants you see and listen i get it the giants are real you're facing some real giants but if you keep believing god you will see your dream happen listen your giant may delay your promise but it won't deny your promise your giant may slow down your progress but it won't stop your progress you got to keep believing keep the faith look what the bible says in hebrews 11 1 about faith it says now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see keeping the faith means you remain confident in what you're hoping for even when you don't see it if you see it let's be honest you don't really have faith don't take faith for things we see but faith is the confident hope in what you don't yet see you got to keep the faith keep hope alive keep believing keep praying keep hoping god will do it if you keep the faith you'll keep the faith i'll never forget as in 2019 we had been in a school for four and a half years and we're just praying and asking god to give us a building and two so 2019 we were praying we were talking with all kinds of different buildings and land and and whatnot and out of nowhere end of 2019 fall of 2019 this building became event didn't even know it was available it was just a god it was a divine appointment and we we were able to able to make an agreement and and we started leasing this building end of 2019 and so some of y'all were here for this we we did like a big celebration service on a sunday night where we met here and we worshiped and we prayed over the entire building we walked around and wrote the names of our loved ones and those in the city we want to get saved and and you guys were just given generously because we had to remodel and repaint and we had to get all new audio and video and light all all that stuff and you're given and and then in january we had 21 days of prayer and fasting and we came here in the building at 6 00 a.m we're praying and we finally got our our launch date march 29th end of march 2020 is going to be grand opening three weeks before easter oh yeah i'm telling y'all we were fired up we're we're going to blow off the the doors on this place we may have to do four or five services we are fired up in the middle of march this thing called coveted oh just shut everything down and i remember i'll be honest with you i was optimistic i i had faith i was like oh this is going it's gonna last two weeks that's all right we'll make our grand opening easter we'll be all right noop easter online and i remember after a month like and what's gonna happen it's not like the lease got delayed we were paying the lease man are people going to keep giving are we going to survive i remember doing facebook lives tapping think think think anybody on i love you we love you we miss you praying for you oh lord just say something in the chat so i can just know you're there and doing that from my living room and just remembering all that and then a month goes by almost two i'll be honest i start to get depressed like man what is going on i remember god why like why is this happening what is going i mean just didn't know some churches were again closing down for good churches were laying off staff like it was a it was a scare just unsure what was gonna happen if would we ever get to have church again if we do will people even come back we got a new building will the building even get done because they had to shut down all the workers and i remember all of that i remember just being in a funk i remember being depressed i remember being angry i remember being god what are you doing and i remember just oh clearly god being like are you gonna trust me are you really gonna trust me are you gonna keep your eyes on this giant called covid and complain and cry or you can put your eyes on me and i remember i'd ask god for forgiveness multiple times forgive me lord and that those months fell so long but finally we got a date in june to open up the building i remember cried that day just man never take it for granted ever again and that i have it we have 10 people 200 300 one actually i knew there would have been five because my family was going to be here if nobody else jamie's going to lead worship and then i was going to preach to my kids but we had service that day and for the first time in the history of our church we had attendance under 200. we launched grand opening over 200 never went under and now we're under and i just think you know what that's all right we planted a church before we can do it again god said he's going to build his church and the gates of hell or the gates of covid will not come listen they will not prevail god's church and so you know we're going to be here and we're going to love people because there are still people in indianapolis we're going to keep loving our church family we're going to love them until they're ready to come back and if they never come back we're still going to love them we're just going to love people we're going to love our city and you know what week by week folks started to trickle back in church family started to come back in the midst of that we start to get all kinds of new families and so i remember december comes all of a sudden we got to add a third service who does that in a pandemic listen it was but god we couldn't see it we weren't even sure if we were going to have church and we're launching a third service in the middle of a pandemic and i stand before you today to tell you we are larger today than we ever were pre-coveted to god be the glory we didn't see it we didn't know what was going to happen but it is him it is god alone listen god wants us to have ridiculous faith even when we can't see it and i'm here to tell you we're not done oh we're not done but because of kovid we're getting ready to launch another campus in in oklahoma in edmond and that guy shut down but i'm here to tell you guess what next fall in august of 2022 we're launching that campus in edmond oklahoma jamie and i we lived in edmond oklahoma for six and a half years i'm so excited pastor herbert's announcing that in in oklahoma city and so they're launching an edmond campus and listen we're not done me and pastor herbert we've been talking we've been praying we've been seeking god and he has put it in our hearts so right now again we we lease out this building he has put it in our hearts that in 2022 we're going to purchase a building we're going to purchase land in a prime location we're going to own our own building we've got ridiculous faith you're like pastor where where's the land where's the building i have no idea i didn't know this was going to fall into our lab but i know god does i know he's got the address he's got the building he's got the land and we're believing in 2022 come on we're going to buy and purchase our own building our own land in a prime location god will do it we can't see it right now but we have ridiculous faith to believe god that he will do it and so we're going to have ridiculous faith no matter what we see number two number two how do you see god do ridiculous things in your life number two you must never forget what god has done for you in the past first samuel 17 34-35 it says but david persisted i've been taking care of my father's sheep and goats he said when a lion or a bear comes to steal a lamb from the flock i go after it with a club and rescue the lamb from its mouth if the animal turns on me i catch it by the jaw and club it to death david believed god could do the ridiculous in his life because he didn't forget how god helped him and did the ridiculous in the past see so many people don't have faith for today because they forgot what god did yesterday when you remember what god has done in your past it gives you confidence and faith for what god can do in the present and in the future listen god has done so much for chris smith 18 years old lost boy hurting lost looking for love in all the wrong places in in lawrence and god found me and he saved me and he changed my life i then went away to bible college and i became a youth pastor i was a youth pastor for 10 years and was blessed to have a youth group the size of five and then a youth group the size of five to six hundred god has done more than i could ever ask or imagine and then he brought us back to indianapolis literally where i grew up to spread his hope and love i remember as a youth pastor because i got saved when i was 18 years old i remember as a youth pastor i would tell i would talk to my students about reaching their campus for christ and i would tell them if there's one regret if there's one thing i wish i could do i wish i could go back i wish i could go back to my high school years i wish i could go back and share the hope and love of jesus christ and you know what's crazy listen little did i know that god would be bringing me back right here to start a campus and i'm reaching those old friends from high school that i'm in the high school now and i'm able to talk about jesus and bring hope and love oh man god has done it before and he will do it again remember in the past gives us faith for the future i've been married 17 years and i'm happy come on i got three children that i love and they love god i got amazing friends i'm part of an amazing church god has done it before and he'll do it again does that mean there weren't challenges oh no there were challenges there were giants there was pain i've been betrayed i've been wounded there were times i thought i couldn't make it but listen i always remember what god did before he will do it again never forget what god has done in your past it's going to help you overcome and get through every giant that crosses your path and that leads me to my third point you must understand battles always precede breakthrough battles always precede breakthrough first samuel chapter 17 verse 35-36 he says i go after it with a club and i rescue the lamb from its mouth if the animal turns on me i catch it by the jaw and i club it to death i have done this with both lions and bears and i'll do it to this pagan philistine too for he has defied the armies of the living god the lord who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear will rescue me from this philistine and saul finally consented all right go ahead he said and may the lord be with you david understood that battles precede breakthrough battles precede breakthrough you win victories by fighting battles you defeat giants by fighting giants you don't get a testimony without a test every time listen david had a testimony of defeating a lion and a bear because he thought a lion and a bear church's battles always precede breakthrough every time you want more victories it requires more battles every time god wants to take you to a new level get ready to fight the devil every time you start pursuing god's dreams the devil attacks with a new scheme listen who told you that you can have progress without pain you can't have a testimony without a test you can't have blessings without burdens you can't have a dream fulfilled without your flesh being killed church we are in a fight and we have to fight we have to fight for our dreams fight for our children fight for our marriages we gotta fight to win souls for christ we gotta fight to win our city we gotta fight to see every last person in indianapolis saved we gotta fight to help heal the hurting and the broken we got to fight for people not to go to hell we got to fight for this next generation the devil's trying to snatch them up and we say in the name of jesus i rebuke you i'm fighting for my kids i'm fighting for the teens we gotta fight to reach our cities this isn't easy it's a fight and people who do ridiculous things for god fight second corinthians 10 4 it says for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in god for pulling down strongholds as we close i want to give you four ways we must fight as a church we're gonna unpack some of these more in the rest of this series but real quick four ways we must fight as a church number one we gotta fight with ridiculous prayers would you start to pray ridiculous big prayers pray prayers you have never prayed before faith filled prayers big prayers to a big god secondly we gotta fight with ridiculous faith would you start believing speaking and acting with big faith come on we're called to be people of faith trusting believing speaking and acting with big faith number three third way we fight is with ridiculous commitment listen don't miss one sunday we got three services y'all you get blessed with tickets to a cold game praise the lord come to the 9 30 service all right you had a late saturday night praise the lord we got to 12 30. just for you sleep into 12 roll in here we are here for you be here every week be here for one night ridiculous commitment and then number four we fight with ridiculous generosity ridiculous generosity when you leave today we're going to give you a card 2021 2021-22 commitment card it says big faith big future and if you're new with us today listen we're not asking you for anything we just want you know you're at a church that has big faith and god is doing great things but if you call people's church your home i want to talk about having ridiculous generosity just give you a couple steps listen number one become a tither if you aren't tithing would you start tithing returning ten percent of your income to the lord let's have ridiculous generosity secondly would you pray about a one year commitment and this next year would you pray and ask god what he would have you give to dream builders over and above your tithe dream builders is how we do missions it's how we got this building it's how we're going to get our future building it's it's how we how we can do more and and so we're just asking you if you call people's church your home would you pray and would you ask god what he would have you give to dream builders over and above your tithe for the next year to see more changed lives and then on december 5th we're having our miracle offering on miracle offering sunday would you give as much as you can as quick as you can your miracle offering gift goes towards your dream builders commitment and so we'll be when you leave we'll pass out these cards and on the back here you'll notice that we have a total here that next year believing as a church we can give 1.5 million dollars and that 1.5 million is for one man we're believing in 2022. we're going to buy land we're going to purchase a building i don't know which one it is in a prime location so that we can have our own building a building that that we own for people's church indianapolis and so that's what india in in oklahoma city their their commitment is different it's for their new campus and for their new building that they're launching but here in indy 1.5 will go towards that and then it also goes towards all of our missions it allows us to continue to support 100 orphans in haiti it allows us to continue to plant churches all across the world that allows us to continue to give to wheeler mission and salvation army right here in indianapolis that are helping the homeless and the hurting and so we figure may take a million 1.25 for the the building in the land and then you know 500 000 or 250 thousands to continue to do all the missions work that we want to do and so that's why there's numbers on here and listen here there's a big faith estimator listen this estimator is all about this listen when it comes to giving it's not about equal giving it's just about equal sacrifice together we can give 1.5 million together together i'm believing by faith we can do that and so would you pray would you ask the lord you'll get this card when you leave and you can pray over it and i'm just believing god i'm believing god is going to use us together to have ridiculous generosity for faithful to tithe faithful to give over and

bF65_wMHzZA,uh but as we continue our series Miracles the title of my message today is this why is your faith not working we've been in a series on miracles and we learned in week one that every Miracle you see in the Bible has one common denominator here's the one common denominator you need a need if you have a need you are a candidate for a miracle last week we learned that if you have a need that you also you need to ask God ask God for your Miracle we learn that we have not because we do not ask God and we've also we also learned that we need to ask that when we ask to ask in faith to ask in faith one of the common ingredients you see in a lot of miracles in the Bible is Faith let me give you some examples look at Matthew chapter 9 verse 22 it says Jesus turned and saw her take heart daughter he said your faith has healed you and the woman was healed at that moment everyone's safe faith Matthew 9 29 then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done by you by faith the blind were healed come on everybody say faith Matthew 15 28 then Jesus said to her woman you have great faith your request is granted and her daughter was healed that moment Mark 10 52 go said Jesus your faith has healed you immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road in Acts 14 9 it says he listened to Paul as he was speaking Paul looked directly at him saw that he had Faith to be healed everyone's safe faith so we need a need we need to ask we need to have faith the question is what is faith and the Bible gives us a definition of Faith it's found in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1. look what the Bible says it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and Assurance about what we do not see some of you may be asking yourself okay well what does that verse mean well let me break it down for you I'm gonna break it down for you okay let me explain it starts off with the word now now is a powerful word because the author is connecting this thought to Hebrews chapter 10 where in Hebrews chapter 10 the author proves that Jesus is our savior he paid the price for our sins on the cross and it says now so now provides for us a new way to live life and that is by faith because of Jesus now we can live by faith it says now Faith is the substance substance means Foundation the Greek word means something placed or set under so faith is the foundation for the Christian the only way the Christian can build a life on Jesus is by faith so Faith it's a it's the substance or foundation in which the Christian builds their life on Jesus faith is the confidence everything is built on it's the foundation your hope stands on faith is like electricity it is VI it is vitally important if we lose electricity in this place nothing works the the lights go out the microphone turns off the air conditioning doesn't work everything in the building shuts down without electricity and it's the same with faith everything in the kingdom of God shuts down without faith and so it says faith is the substance or Foundation of things hoped for and Assurance about what we do not see faith all right Faith it's the conviction the hope the confidence the Assurance the certainty The Firm persuasion the trust that the Unseen Promises of God will be fulfilled in your life Faith is rooted in the substance or Foundation of who God is and Faith stretches forward to believe what God says a summary of Hebrews 11 1 could be this now that Jesus proved his love and Power on the cross we now have a foundation that gives us confidence hope proof and an absolute conviction and expectation that God will do what he said he would do faith is an expectation a confidence that God can and will do what he said it's a trust-filled expectation that God is who he says he is and will do what he said he would do it's not believing God can it's knowing God will and so as we learn what faith is important to understand that faith and belief are not the same thing people confuse faith with belief a lot of people are not in faith they're in belief and belief will not produce Kingdom results in your life let me explain James 2 19. the author says you believe that there is one God good even the demons believe that and shudder demons believe in God and know more about God than a lot of people do but they do not have faith in God because believing in faith are not the same thing you can believe in God and not have faith in God so let me teach you about faith today everyone say faith number one you have faith in God when it's accompanied with action you have faith in God when it's accompanied with action James 2 17 it says in the same way Faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead you can believe that your car works you can know everything about your car you can know it but the motor and the engine and you can know about the the alternator and all the lines and gas lines and brake system you can know about all that stuff you can even talk to your car name your car come on how many people have given your car a name it's like how many a few of you you can you name your car you can wash it all nice and wax it down you can even go ahead take a seat in the car but that is not going to move your car you can sit in it you can wash it you can call it a name you can know all about it but that's not going to get that car to move the only way that car is moving is you gotta get the keys you got to stick it in the ignition and you gotta turn that car on or if you know you got a newer car just push the button yeah but it takes action without action that car is not moving it's not going anywhere you have to put your belief into action to see results that's faith faith requires action listen belief will keep you where you are but faith will move you where God wants you to be believer keep you where you are but faith will move you to where God wants you to be if you don't take action you don't have faith James says you have a dead Faith you can't even get saved without faith it's my second Point number two you are saved through faith faith is the starting line the open door the Gateway the key to the beginning of your relationship with God in the kingdom of God faith starts it all and Faith sustains it all Faith starts it all and it sustains it all Ephesians 2 8-9 it says for it is by Grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of God not by work so that no one can boast we are saved through faith you can't even be saved without faith in God faith is like electricity everything in the Kingdom shuts down without it number three you cannot please God without faith look at Hebrews 11 6 it says and without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him what does faith look like that pleases God you first must believe that God is you can't stop there then you must believe that God rewards those who earnestly or diligently seek Him and notice it doesn't say he rewards those who earnestly seek money or possessions people or popularity no no God says if you seek me I will automatically reward you if you will put God first if you will honor God in your life God will reward you faith that pleases God seeks God with all your heart because you know that God will reward you if you don't believe God is and you don't earnestly seek God you don't have faith that pleases God those are bars y'all go ahead write them down put them out sing a song wrap it whatever you want but if you don't believe God is and you don't earnestly seek God you don't have faith that pleases God number four is this you have been given a Measure of Faith every Christ follower has been given a Measure of Faith at Salvation look at Romans 12 3. for I say through the grace given to me to everyone who is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly as God has dealt to each one a Measure of Faith now Faith in the context of this verse is not saving Faith okay this is this is talking about how at Salvation God gives every Christ follower a Measure of Faith so that we can begin to access all the benefits that are available in the kingdom of God and there are many benefits that are available to Christians and we receive them through faith so God gives every Christ follower a Measure of Faith number five you can develop your faith by hearing God's word Romans 10 17 it says so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God our faith develops by hearing the word of God you need to hear the word of God preach attending church is important because your faith is developed by hearing the word of God hearing the word of God it'll help you go from believing to Faith from dead Faith to action from knowing the word of God to obeying the word of God if you don't obey God's word you don't have faith look what James 1 22 says it says but be doers of the word and not hears only deceiving yourselves you're deceiving yourself if you don't put God's word into practice because Faith requires action number six you can develop your faith by withstanding tests if you want to build muscle how many know you can't just look at the weights and the muscle comes on having no you can't just lift the bar I mean maybe if that's where you start but if it's how you know there's got to be some resistance there's got to be some pain there's got to be some so you got to work it you got to work at something that's causing some resistance and pain because that that breaks down your muscle and then you can start to build up your muscle you got to tear your muscles for them to grow there's pain involved but they grow stronger with resistance and pain if you want to grow smarter you want to get a diploma you want to get a degree you have to pass what tests got a past tests you gotta if you want to go to the next level you got to pass test and to develop your faith you have to face test face resistance and pass the tests of life James says it like this in James chapter 1 verse two through three it says considerate pure joy my brothers and sisters whenever you face Trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance listen the test you're facing with your health is an opportunity for your faith to develop the test you're facing at your workplace your school with your friends in your marriage with your family with your finances it is there to develop your faith faith is a lot like school you need to pass the test or you'll keep taking the grade over and over and over again God wants to develop your faith so that you can move into what he has next for your life listen to this when you're going through the tests of life don't forget in the dark what God spoke to you in the light some of y'all are going through a test it is dark it is challenging I'm here to remind you today don't forget what God told you in the light when you're dealing with the darkness of the test he's with you he'll get you through he'll carry you through this test it shall pass it's going to develop you and strengthen you and get you to where God wants you to go come on he giving you everything you need to pass the test keep living by faith number seven is this you fight by faith when you gave your life to the Lord you joined team Jesus and you're in a fight against the devil and his demons you're in a war come on that's why when you gave your life to Christ all hell broke loose you know what I mean you're like Oh I thought things would get better why is it getting harder you're trying to do the four-week challenge and you're like why is it harder to get to church why am I facing more challenges listen because living for Jesus isn't easy but I'm telling you God will do something in you he'll strengthen you he'll make you stronger so be like man I try to join a small group and why does it feel like oh hell's coming against me just to get to one grew because the devil's not happy all hell is trying to break loose on you but you got to know greater is he that's in me that's in the world that God is with you if he before you who can be against you and God's going to take you to new levels and yes there'll be some new Devils but God will help you defeat every single one everyone and he's going to strengthen your faith you're going to be able to fight by faith that's why Paul says in first Timothy 6 12 fight the good fight of faith you have to fight the good fight of faith that's why Paul tells us in Ephesians 6 we got to put on the armor of God every day every day we got to put on the armor Smith Wigglesworth said this great faith is the product of great fights great testimonies are the outcome of great tests great triumphs can only come out of great trials got to put up the spiritual Dukes you got to remember who's in your corner and he's with you to fight the good fight of faith number eight you are protected by faith faith will protect you from the attacks of the devil Ephesians 6 16 it says in addition to all of this take up the shield of faith with which you can just extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one you need to know that when Paul is using this illustration he's not talking about a little Shield he's not even talking about Captain America's shield okay the kind of shields they use back in the day that Shield was six feet tall and three feet wide it was the size of a door so that when you were in battle you can literally stand behind this shield and it doesn't matter how many arrows come not one of them's touching you not one of them you got the shield to protect you because that's how they fought back they fought with arrows right and so he's letting you know listen you got to put your faith your faith if you will build your faith grow live by faith your faith will put up a shield that'll protect you from every arrow the enemy sends your way Faith blocks the lies the doubt the fear and the attacks of the the evil one and I want you to develop your faith so you aren't walking around with a small shield and allowing the enemy's flaming arrows to hit your life number nine is this you are called to live by faith we're saved by faith we please God with faith we have a measure of faith we can develop our faith we're in a faith fight we're protected by faith and we're called to live by faith Romans 1 17 for in it the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith second Corinthians 5 7 it says for we live by faith not by sight live is the key word in life how many days do you live in a year how many days do you live in a month how many days do you live in a week how many hours do you live every day the Bible says you are called to live every single day by faith you need to have faith 365 days a year seven days a week 24 hours a day you live by faith because faith is like electricity everything shuts down without faith you cannot access the promises of God without faith every day every hour every minute every second you need to live by faith hear me today faith is not a Sunday thing it's a daily thing it's a daily thing it's not a Sunday thing it's a daily thing number 10 you can miss out on Miracles by having a lack of faith Matthew 13 58 Jesus said it says or the the writer says Matthew said and he did not do many miracles there he was referring to Jesus he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith listen your faith is the delivery system to the miraculous your faith creates an atmosphere for the miraculous I don't want you to lack Faith you have to be committed to developing your faith so you don't miss your Miracle due to a lack of faith and then lastly number 11. you can move mountains with small faith Matthew chapter 17 verse 20 he replied because you have so little faith truly I tell you if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you when you hear this you might think that it contradicts the last point because a mustard seed is very small but the emphasis isn't so much on the quality of your faith excuse me it isn't so much on the quantity of your faith it is on the quality of your faith see the disciples hadn't placed their full trust in Jesus they had some faith but not strong faith and you need to be committed to developing a quality Faith a strong faith just a little bit of quality faith in God can move mountains and so you may be saying well how do I have a strong faith how do I get a strong faith listen you got to read God's word daily you need the word of God so that when your faith starts to waver you got his promises to lift up your faith and build your faith and strengthen your faith that's why you got to come to church every week so you can hear the word of God preach if you want your teenager to have strong faith you got to make sure they're epic every single Wednesday night our youth ministry where they're going to hear the word of God if you want to have strong faith you got to be obedient to God's word even when you don't feel like it oh that's when you know your faith is rising that's when you know it's getting stronger even when you don't feel like it I'm gonna obey you Lord I'ma follow your word you know how you can build your faith obey God's word by getting water baptized next Sunday celebration Sunday some of you've given your life to Christ and you haven't taken that step telling you getting water baptized it's going to build your faith it's going to strengthen your face obedience strengthens your faith be a tither serve on the Dream Team be in a small group you need a quality of Faith so you can see mountains moved in a quality Faith it's accompanied with we don't just believe no no we are people faith matter of fact later in the service we're going to have our prayer team up here to pray for miracles listen God still does miracles would you put your faith into action would you come forward would you would you let our prayer team prayer for you faith is followed by action because faith says I trust you God whatever you say I do I don't care what the world says I don't care what what you say I do what your word says I do faith says I trust you with everything I trust you with my life I trust you with my relationships I trust you with my finances I trust you with my career faces I trust you with everything everything that's Faith that's the kind of faith that God wants us to have

some strong opinions I told you you got some strong opinions and if you ask a lot of people if God is a god of works or a god of Grace they will have some strong opinions some would say God is a god of Grace acts 15 verse 10 and 11. it says now then why do you try to test God by putting on the next of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear no we believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved just as they are this is so true about our God we can only be saved by grace and not by works Ephesians 2 8 9. it says for it is by Grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of God not by work so that no one can boast we are saved by grace not by works you cannot work to be saved you cannot earn your salvation you can't ever be good enough kind enough give enough holy enough love enough or stop enough bad habits to be right with God you can only be saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ but after you're saved your life will change see you don't change to get saved but you do change because you are saved Jesus is all about Grace but he's also all about truth John 1 17 for the law was given through Moses Grace and Truth come through Jesus Christ Jesus is Grace and Truth your preference might be Grace Grace marvelous Grace or your preference might be truth you better live the truth the word of God you you better be holy but with Jesus there is no preference he is both Grace and Truth you receive salvation only by the grace of God through faith in Jesus and then after salvation you live by the truth of God's word God's grace doesn't give you a license to ignore the truth of his word God's grace doesn't give us a license to keep on sinning it's quite the opposite look at Romans chapter 6 verse 1 and 2 it says well then should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his Wonderful Grace verse 2 of course not since we have died to sin how can we continue to live in it when we give our lives to Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of us and so we can't keep living the same way because the holy spirit's job is to change us to make us more like Jesus in theological terms it's a fancy word called sanctification you cannot become a Christian and not change it's not possible because the Holy Spirit living inside of you makes you more and more like Jesus change is a part of the Christian Life first John 5 18 it says we know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin it's sanctification they become more like Jesus the one who was born of God keeps them safe then the evil one cannot harm them in first John 2 29 it says if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him when you give your life to Jesus you will start doing the right things that honor God second Timothy 2 19 it says nevertheless God's solid foundation stands firm sealed with this inscription the Lord knows who are his and everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness when you give your life to Jesus the Holy Spirit Will begin leading you away from different sins it's a process God continues to change us until we die it's called sanctification First John 3 6 it says no one who lives in him keeps on sinning no one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him change isn't optional for a Christian if you're a Christian you will change First John 3 9 it says no one who was born of God will continue to sin because God's seed remains in them the seed of the Holy Spirit the seed of the Gospel it says they cannot go on sinning because they have been born of God if you say you're a Christian and nothing has ever changed in your life it's questionable that the seed of Christ is inside of you because when the Holy Spirit is living inside of you he begins to change you something in your life will change and the change doesn't always happen immediately but it will happen it's just like when a woman gets pregnant when Jamie first was pregnant no one had any idea you could not look at her and tell that she was pregnant but a a baby was growing inside of her I'll never forget um our first pregnancy we went on a trip to Europe Jamie and I did and Jamie was pregnant and we were in Paris there we are and you would have no idea that Jamie was pregnant or bearing child but at that time she was pregnant but you know what as time went on her belly started to get bigger this has happened three times in our family Bailey got bigger and a baby came out I mean we got a whole family of five but each time she was prep you would have never known that there was a but it started to grow and if you're pregnant with the power of the Holy Spirit eventually you will give birth to love peace and joy and patience and kindness and self-control your life life change may not happen overnight but it will happen your spiritual belly will eventually start showing you won't be sinless but you will sin less you will have more used to's than still Do's the holy spirit makes you want to change he changes your have to's to want to change is a part of the Christian Life when you give your life to Jesus again the holy spirit's inside of you and it begins to work and begin to grow and there are maybe some things that are overnight but I can tell you the change that happened in my life after I gave my life to Jesus there were some things that changed immediately but there were others it took months it took years listen today I've been living for the Lord now for over 20 years and listen there's still things that God is still trying to change and work in me that the holy spirit is still trying to work in my life and and the question is this here's the question what keeps Christians from changing what causes a Christian to stay stuck in the same sin pattern the same bad habits the same stinking thinking the same destructive Behavior and today I want to help you experience the change that God has for your life so that you can live with fewer regrets in 2023. I want to compare two kings in the Bible King Saul and King David they were very similar and yet very different both were Kings over Israel both were anointed by God both made mistakes but the Legacy they left behind were very different let's look at King Saul's Legacy in first Samuel chapter 15 verse 53 it says until the day Samuel died he did not go to see Saul again those Samuel mourned for him look what the Bible says it says and the Lord regretted that he had made Saul King over Israel I don't want the Lord regretting that he chose me to be Jamie's husband that he chose me to be the father of Jace Cali and Cohen friends to my small group and other friends the king Saul's Legacy was the Lord regretted he made him King look at King David's Legacy and contrast acts 13 22. it says after removing Saul he made David their King God testified concerning him I have found David Son of Jesse a man after my own heart he will do everything I want him to acts 13 36 it says now when David had served God's purpose in his own generation he fell asleep and was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed how is it possible for two men anointed by God to be leader over his people and one God regretted and rejected and the other was a man after God's Own Heart who lived out God's purpose for his life the answer is this one was willing to change and the other was not one was willing to change the other was not if we got to talk to Saul he would have had a lot of I wish I would have changed I wish I would have changed so I want us to learn some valuable lessons about changing from David and Saul here's the first lesson I want us to learn Saul had a prideful heart but David had a humble heart one of the key reasons Saul didn't change was he allowed his success to develop pride in his heart and when he became king he got a big head first Samuel 15 17 Samuel said although you were once small in your own eyes did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel the Lord anointed you King over Israel see Saul started out small in his own eyes but success caused him to get big in his own eyes he became so big that he began to ignore the commands of God he one time he took it upon himself to act as a priest instead of waiting on Samuel the priest look at first Samuel 13 9 he said bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings and Saul offered up the burnt offering see the priest was supposed to offer up the burnt offering but Saul had become so big in his own eyes and thought he could do things his way instead of God's way because of Pride he's like I don't care what Sam I'm gonna do what I want to do I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna offer up the burnt offering look at listen to what else he did in first Samuel chapter 15 verse 12. it says early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul but he was told Saul had gone to Carmel there he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to kilgall Saul had became so big his head got so big the brother built a monument to himself he just thought he was all that in a bag of chips and built his own Monument not in God's honor but in his own honor David on the other hand didn't allow his success to go to his head David became king but he stayed small in his own eyes he didn't set up a monument in his own honor he wanted to build God a monument he wanted to build a temple for the Lord look at First Kings 8 17. it says my father had it in his heart to build a temple for the name of the Lord the god of Israel second Samuel 7 18. it says then King David went in and sat before the Lord and he said who am I Sovereign Lord and what is my family that you have brought me this far David was King but he stayed small in his own eyes he was small and he made God big second Samuel 7 22 how great you are sovereign Lord there is no one like you not there is no one like me and I'm so special and no no God you are the awesome one and there is no God but you and we have heard with our own ears see David had a heart to change because he stayed small in his own eyes Church stay little in your own eyes don't become conceited entitled don't think you deserve what you have don't think you deserve more stay little and make God big you decrease and let God increase listen prideful people resist change humble people they are yielded to the work of God and what God wants to do in their heart and so stay little you decrease some of you you've become big in your own eyes you think you're better than others your accomplishments have puffed you up the money you make the possessions you acquired they have gone to your head today humble yourself before God rather than having God humble you like he did Saul let me give you the second lesson Saul feared man but David feared God first Samuel 15 24 it says then Saul said to Samuel I have sinned I've violated the Lord's command and your instructions I was afraid of the man and so I gave in to them started blaming the men Saul became gripped by the fear of man he desired to please people more than pleasing God and our lives are in a dangerous place When We Fear man more than we fear God look at Proverbs 29 25 it says fearing people is a dangerous trap but trusting the Lord means safety fear of man fearing people the fear of man's opinion the Bible says it is a trap it is a dangerous trap but if you will trust God it means safety listen you won't if you won't change because you're so consumed with what people think about you it's a it's a dangerous trap and so you get into a relationship with someone you have no business being with you stay in toxic friendships that pull you away from Jesus you're unethical in your business deals you're lying to your spouse your parents your co-workers and your teachers your life is all about creating an image and protecting your image so that you can look good in front of people fear of people it is a trap and it will keep you from changing it'll have you later on in life with regrets saying I wish I would have trusted God and not feared people but David was more concerned with pleasing God than pleasing people he had a fear of God he wrote these words in Psalm 34 9 fear the lord you his holy people for those who fear Him lack nothing Psalm 34 11 come my children listen to me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord David feared God and he wanted to teach others to fear the lord and two verses later he goes on to write that fearing God leads to a changed life in verse 13 and 14. it says keep your tongue from evil in your lips from telling lies turn from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it when you fear God more than you fear people it will lead to your speech changing it will lead you turning away from Evil it will lead you seeking after good things like peace two similar people with two different outcomes why one changed and one did not David changed and Saul did not let me give you the third lesson Saul Justified his sins but David repented from his sins Saul and David both sinned against God they weren't perfect people none of us are after they both sinned against God a prophet of God confronted them and these two kings had drastically different responses how they responded to their sin caused one to change and one to avoid change when Saul disobeyed the Lord's direct command the prophet Samuel confronted him and rather than owning up to his sin Saul Justified his actions he made excuses for his sin look at first Samuel 15 15. salt answered the soldiers brought them from the amalekites they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God but we totally destroyed the rest Saul knew he was in trouble here God didn't ask him to spare anything God told him to destroy it all but he tried to justify well I kept what was good because I wanted to sacrifice it to you Lord and then we did destroy all the rest and God's like that's not what I asked you and it's not what I told you he was just defying first Samuel 15 19 and 20 why did you not obey the Lord why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord but I did obey the Lord Saul said I went on the mission the Lord assigned me I completely destroyed the amalekites and brought back egg their King notice how he left out the one thing that he did not do right he's like he just shared the 75 percent of the mission that he did and did right Saul made excuses for his Disobedience rather than owning his sin asking for forgiveness and repenting instead he pointed the finger everywhere else listen you can make excuses or you can make changes but you can't do both you can make excuses or you can make changes but you can't make both we're all good at justifying our sin and making excuses for them well my boss is a jerk so I'm Gonna Be a Jerk back you know what the Bible says treat others the way that they treat you no go look up that verse treat them the way you want to be treated I mean that a ploy is cutting corners and getting bonuses well I'm gonna do the same thing I mean they lied on me so I'm lying on them I mean they heard they hold they hurt me deeply I'm not going to forgive them I'ma hold on to unforgiveness my heart is in so much pain I have to get drunk at night to forget all this pain I mean my spouse isn't meeting my needs and I deserve to be happy so it's okay if I step out on them I'm like this because this is how I this is just the way I am I can't help it I have to I need to I Can't Stop and when we justify our sin we don't want to change like Saul we can get so busy making excuses rather than making changes but David committed some horrible sins but his response was very different than Saul's when the prophet Nathan called David out for his adultery and murder I want you to see David's immediate response second Samuel 12 13 then David said to Nathan I have sinned against the Lord Nathan replied the Lord has taken away your sin you are not going to die David took ownership of his sin no excuses just a broken heart before God owning our sin leads to repentance of sin David owned his sin and he wrote these words in Psalm 51 you can read that whole Psalm but I'm just going to give you a couple verses so you can see David's heart Psalm 51 2-4 he said wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me for my sin for I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me against you you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so you are right in your verdict and Justified when you judge in verse 10 and 11 he prayed created me a pure heart o God and renew a steadfast Spirit Within Me do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me David repented he was caught in his sin confronted and instead of making excuses he repented and he changed and at the end of his life even after committing adultery and murder God said David was a man after my own heart David lived out my purpose for his life why because David changed he repented of his sin he didn't make excuses like Saul he didn't justify like Saul so that he could just continue to live the way he wanted to live he repented before God and said God forgive me he repented he repented he repented so if you'll bow your heads and close your eyes I just want to talk to some of you in the room today I don't want you to I want you to have less regrets in 2023 and I realize there may be some of you in this room today that right now you're confronted with your sin just like David and Saul and I want to give you an opportunity right now to repent I want to give you an opportunity right now to change to stop to say no more I'm done living my way I'm done indulging in this life of sin I know the holy spirit it's in me it's convicting me it's speaking to me and today right now in this moment I want to repent and I want to change with every head bowed and every eye closed if that's you today and right now you just need to repent of some sin before God would you just raise your hand to the Lord right now come on would you just lift your hand thank you thank you thank you come on let's pray father God right now we repent we repent forgive us of our sin God we don't want to keep making excuses we don't want to keep justifying but we want to change we want to live your way God help each person in this room to Humble themselves before you help them to fear you more than they fear man and right now I thank you for the repentance that's happening in this room I thank you for the Forgiveness that's happening in this room right now God I thank you that the Lord you are saying to each person with their hand raised as you said to David the Lord has taken away your sin the Lord has taken away your sin the Lord has taken away your sin in Jesus name in Jesus name come on can we thank God that he takes away our sin can we thank him for his grace and his truth and his love church family could we stand all across this room come on let's just stand and let's just worship God and thank him for his forgive goodness and thank him that he takes away our sin when we repent
W38jkmB-9sY,well we're in this series called own it where we want to break free from excuses and the title of my message today is own your mental and emotional health own your mental and emotional health I I'm curious of of the audience today when it comes to filling up your car with gas how many of you fill up when your uh your your your gas tank is three4 full it's still three4 full how many

pastor I wait for that little light to pop on to let me know that I'm about to hit hit e and that's when I feel like where where where my folks at you know oh praise the Lord for that little light if it ever went out I would be in trouble matter of fact my my current vehicle I have one of those cars where It'll like show you your mileage right like how many miles you have to you need to refill and my light comes on when I have about 40 miles left and I'm like okay how many I know I be counting sometimes I mean I don't fill up right away but previous to that I had a vehicle that didn't do that you had to measure it by the eye you know what I meany how deep into the how how you know how deep into the red or and uh man one time Jamie and I we were we had a flight to Oklahoma City and we were cutting it a little tight and uh I I was the light came on and I'm like ah man I'll get it I'll get it when we you know after we when we fly back I'll get it because there's a gas station right by the airport and so we're going and we're coming we're on the interstate and we're coming up to the exit and ran out of gas I'm like can I push this vehicle over to that gas station I could see it off the ramp it was raining y your pastor was out there I I like all my legs I was pushing I was struggling y'all might have saw me that day looking like a fool on uh I just ran out of gas and in life you can run so hard so fast and run out of gas mentally physically and emotionally you can move so fast in life and misread your gas gauges you weren't planning on running out of gas but you find yourself with nothing left in the tank you're showing up at work at school at home in your relationships and you don't even realize you're running out of gas and about to stop in the middle of the road of Life about 12 years ago I was I was running hard I was running too hard I was unhealthy I was uh I I was struggling I was running so hard so fast I was distant even from Jamie I was distant from my kids and I was getting unhealthy emotionally and mentally and physically and and I wasn't reading my gas gauges right I was starting to really battle some anxiety started to have some panic attacks matter of fact had some panic attack so strong I found myself uh in the the hospital and and and listen I wasn't these weren't things that I wasn't I was was planning for I wasn't planning on it but I wasn't reading my gas gauges right I wasn't paying attention and I found myself stopped in the middle of the road of Life found myself mentally physically and emotionally unhealthy and there's a story in the Bible about a man who wasn't reading his gas gauges properly and he ran out of gas and it about cost him his life in First Kings 18 Elijah he called fire down from heaven he defeated the prophets of Baal and then King Ahab had heard about how Elijah defeated the prophets of Baal and he told his wife and let me read to you what happens next in First Kings 19 verse 1-4 it says now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword so Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say May the gods deal with me be it ever so severely if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them and the Bible says Elijah was afraid and ran for his life when he came to beers Sheba in Judah he left his servant there while he himself went a day Journey Into the Wilderness he came to a broom Bush sat down under it and pray that he might die I've had enough Lord he said take my life I'm no better than my ancestors Elijah was running so hard and so fast and found himself in a bad place mentally physically and emotionally he wanted to end his life what do you do when you're in a bad place mentally and emotionally how do you begin to own your emotional and mental health how do you own it so that you can keep your yourself from running out of gas today I want to give you six habits to owning your health six habits to owning your health number one is this own recognizing the warning signs of being emotionally unhealthy I want you to notice the warning signs that led to Elijah running out of Gap he was working hard he had just defeated the prophets of Baal he just had this great Victory and shortly after his victory the Bible says in First Kings 19:3 that he was afraid he was dealing with an extreme amount of fear his emotions and adrenaline were already on a hive from this encounter with the prophets of Baal and now he's facing this huge threat from Jezebel and his emotions are all over the place and then he ran for his life he had no break after the prophets of Baal he just kept going he doesn't recognize that his gas tank is running low he's pushing through and running hard and fast and then he left his servant and isolated ated himself his gas tank was running low and then he went into the Wilderness all by himself isolating himself was one of the worst things he could have done then he admitted that he had had enough he couldn't take it anymore he's overwhelmed he's worn out he was out of gas he was ready to die the Bible tells us the warning signs that Elijah faced and to own your emotional health you have to begin to recognize the warning signs are your emotions all over the place fearful worried anxiety stress depression constant sadness or hopelessness maybe there's a chemical imbalance when I kept having these panic attacks again I was ashamed I was embarrassed I didn't want to tell anybody but I finally told my doctor just all the different things I was feeling and he went ahead and ran some other tests and actually found out I do have a a a a slight imbalance and so he gave me a medication I take to this day that is tremendously uh helped me out but you got to you got to recognize the warning signs do you have constant mood swings erratic emotions frequently crying unhealthy responses to people angry agitated lashing out are you always tired worn out having a difficulty sleeping are you going at an unsustainable Pace are you ignoring the Sabbath day not taking one day off a week have you isolated yourself you you've pulled away from your family and friends there's maybe a lack of interest in activities that you used to love or or a lack of focus you have difficulty concentrating or giving full attention to whatever you're working on your performance is declining you got you got to recognize the warning signs and I want you to begin to own your health by recognizing the warning signs be honest with yourself don't lie to yourself if you're not doing well admit it you may still have some gas in your tank but you're seeing some warning signs be honest with yourself so that you can get some help when you go to the doctor what do they ask you they ask you okay what's wrong what are your symptoms and you don't tell them my toe is hurting when your hand is hurting right that ain't going to do you no good to get treatment on your toe when it's your hand that's hurting because listen if you're not honest with your symptoms you will not get the right diagnosis and you will not get the right prescribed treatment and some of you you're trying to hide your symptoms you're ignoring the warning signs you're not being honest with yourself and you are going to run out of gas number two you have to own evaluating how you got where you are so helpful to read the story of Elijah and to see what led to him running out of gas there are times in life we see the warning signs we know we're running out of gas but we never evaluate why we never ask what's causing me to run low on gas so many people are struggling but they keep doing the same thing they keep living the same lifestyle until they finally run out of gas in the middle of the road of life so I want you to recognize the warning signs and then ask yourself how did I get to this place why am I running out of gas what do I I need to own and change so that I can get to a healthier place in my life I'm telling you I had to start evaluating where I was and how I got where I got and how I ran out of gas and how I got so bad yeah yes there wasn't in there were other things I wasn't sleeping well I was working too hard I wasn't taking a Sabbath and so I had to I had to identify okay what got me here because once you identify it then you can begin to change it and so as you evaluate if you aren't sure what's causing you to get to an unhealthy Place point three will help you here's number three on listening to spiritual guidance First Kings 19:7 it says the angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said get up and eat for the journey is too much for you the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah on mult multiple occasions okay but I'm not going to focus on the angel speaking to Elijah what I want you to notice is that Elijah didn't listen to his own voice see when you're in a bad place the worst person you can listen to is yourself because when you're in a bad place you don't see things clearly your perspective is clouded your brain is foggy you're tired and you are not in a good place emotionally you need someone who is spiritually mature to speak into your life notice I said spiritually mature someone who walks with God someone who knows God's word has proven success in their own life so that they can speak into your life see your natural tendency when you're not doing well is to do what Elijah did and that's to isolate yourself your tendency will be to to pull away from relationships but you got to force yourself to get around godly people you need people who will speak the truth in love to you you need people who can see what you can't see about yourself people who are full of wisdom people who will give you biblical guidance and one of the best things some of you could do for your mental physical and emotional and spiritual health is getting a small group listen you got to own it you got to own it push through wanting to isolate yourself push through the awkward feelings we can all have when building relationships push through your insecurities uh wondering what people will think about you and get in a small group get some Godly voices in your life that will help you get some gas back in the tank some of you running on low you're running on E one one of the best things you can do get in a small group get in a men's group get in a women's group get in a freedom group get in Brotherhood get in Sisterhood activity groups we got all kinds of different groups out there mom's groups dad's groups Mary I we got all kinds listen what you get in a group get some Godly voices in your life that will help you put gas back in your tank number four number four own doing the Practical things how me know sometimes we get too spiritual we're in a bad place mentally emotionally physically I'm binding the devil I'm pleading the blood I'm speaking in tongues I'm anointing myself with oil I'm confessing the word I'm lifting my hands to praise God I'm speaking the name of Jesus I'm declaring Victory I'm more than a conqueror and God says that's all good but you need to take a nap and get some rest yeah you wearing yourself out doing I just go ahead take a nap first Kings 19:5 and 6 it says then he laid down under the bush and fell asleep all at once an angel touched him and said get up and eat he looked around and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals in a jar of water look at this he ate and drank drank and then lay down again the angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said get up and eat for the journey is too much for you practical things helped Elijah eat you're hangry you got an empty stomach you are sleep deprived you're running yourself ragged sleep he woke up n you ain't ready eat and sleep some more practical things and he listened he listened to the voice of the Angel he rested he slept he ate sometimes the most practical things can help you the most they can put gas back in your tank get some rest take a day off every week it's the Sabbath is holy God created it take a nap start sleeping go to bed earlier figure out why you're not sleeping well start eating a good meal cut out fried food and sugar eat healthier start exercising go on a walk every day in your neighborhood start going to the gym stop isolating yourself and get in a small group today own the Practical things they will help you get some gas in your tank number five own pursuing the presence of God first Kings chapter 19: 9-13 it says there he went into a cave and spent the night and the word of the Lord came to him what are you doing here Elijah he replied I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty the Israelites have rejected your Covenant torn down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword I'm the only one left and now they're trying to kill me too the Lord said go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord for the Lord is about to pass by the Bible says then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind after the wind there was an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake after the earthquake came a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire came a gentle whisper when Elijah heard it he pulled his cloak over his face he went out and stood at the mouth of the cave and then a voice said to him what are you doing here Elijah Elijah owned getting in the presence of God and it's so encouraging to me that it didn't take some massive move of God for the Lord to work in Elijah's life God wasn't in the wind the earthquake or the fire god spoke to Elijah in a whisper church if you want to get some gas in your tank you have to own getting in the presence of God it's the small Whispers of God that can change your life it's the small spiritual disciplines that can put gas back into your tank start praying and reading your Bible every day so you can hear the whispers of God daily come to church every Sunday so you can experience corporate worship and hearing the preaching of God's word and God will whisper to you and he'll fill your gas tank that's why we do the four-week challenge it's not about crumble cookie I hope you enjoy them but we do it so that you can get planted in God's house so that your spiritual tank gets filled every single Sunday listen let me put it this way but you can't make it through your week without a full tank success starts Sunday it starts in go I can't make it I I am here every Sunday to get full for the week that lies ahead of me how many you know sometimes a full gas tank can't even make it a week you ever been there like why am I filling up my tank again that's why you got to pray and read your Bible every day come on keep it keep it keep topping it off keep topping it off keep topping it off you need spiritual gas to face the challenges of life you have to own consistently getting in the presence of God and then number six own pursuing God's purpose for your life after Elijah rested ate heard the voice of an Angel got in the presence of God then God told him to go go back to his purpose to get back to living out the reason why God put him on Earth listen Church living out God's purpose will help your emotional and mental health you were created on purpose for a purpose First Kings 19:1 15-16 it says the Lord said to him go back the way you came and go to the desert of Damascus when you get there a anoint hezel king of Aram also anoint juu son of nimi King over Israel and anoint Elisha son of Chaat from Abel mahola to succeed you as Prophet Elijah went from running to having purpose again he was going to annoint some Kings he was going to spend the rest of his life mentoring Elisha to take his place as a prophet living out God's purpose can put gas back in your tank I'll never forget 20120 I'm sure as most of us will when the world shut down and we stopped having Church in the building and um I just remember going through that time March and then April and May and I just remember feeling depressed missed preaching I missed being in God's house I miss being with you I was I was struggling because I felt like I wasn't living out my my my god-given purpose when we I I come in by myself and I just preach to an empty room if I needed to but I just I I listen when you're living out God's purpose for your life it feels that spiritual tank and I remember just being in a funk and God had to work me and he had to help me through it but sometimes if I'm on vacation too long I can start to get a little depressed I'm I'm ready to come come back I'm I miss you I'm going for two I'm like where my hey I'm going for a week where my people at are they here are they here that's what God's purpose does listen you were created on purpose for a purpose you were created to build God's kingdom to serve people to make disciples to help people know God and grow in God and serve on the on the Dream Team you will get your gas tank full by living out his purpose some of you your purpose is to invest in kids when you when you give your life to raising up kids to love Jesus is going to fill your gas tank for some of you it's investing in teenagers and helping them love God and make wise decisions is going to fill your gas tank some of you you need to lead a marriage small group so you can help young married couples or lead an addiction small group so that you can help people get free like you got free or lead a divorce small group to help people who are hurting and need hope and and healing lead a business small group and raise up business owners for the kingdom of God or lead a financi finial small group and help people experience Financial Freedom listen when you start making disciples when you start serving others when you start investing on others God's going to put gas in your tank he's going to fill you up because you were created on purpose for a purpose and when you are living out that purpose he will fill up your tank you were created to build the kingdom of God and when you start living out that purpose God fuels your tank and so I want to encourage enourage you on your health in 2024 2024 get emotionally mentally spiritually and physically healthy on it I I'll close with our theme verse Philippians 2:12 so then my beloved just as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your salvation with fear and trembling you got to work it out you got to work it out if you're going to own it you got to work it out when it comes to your emotional mental you got to work it out you got to recognize the signs

always easy absolutely not there are U some tremendously hard days but it's okay because I'm living my purpose it's all right I'll take those days all day long because I'm I'm living out my purpose and so let's own it
gQGRAdzO2jE,exercising is hard work getting on a budget and staying on a budget is hard work Jamie and I did our 2024 budget it's hard work keeping your house clean with kids is hard work and how many of you know that relationships are hard work having a good marriage is hard work Jamie and I we've been married over 19 years and we've had great seasons and some bad Seasons it's hard work to be married a long time it's even harder to be married a long time and have a god honoring marriage parenting is hard work it's a lot of work to raise kids who love the Lord in this crazy world having relationships with some of our family members is hard work some grandparents or maybe that crazy uncle or Aunt cousins in-laws this hard work dating is hard work friendships are hard work it's a lot of work to have good friendship come on just look at your neighbor tell them you're a lot of work tell them hey now look at your second choice and say I didn't talk to you first because child you're double to work yeah tell them tell them because relationships are so hard a lot of people have given up on them talking about Christian people have given up on relationships I hear Christians say I love God but I don't want anything to do with God's people they think they're just fine all by themselves they say things like I am better off in life if I just spend my time with me myself and I all I need is me and Jesus me and Jesus are a good team me and Jesus are good enough I don't need anyone else but Church here's the interesting thing the first problem in the Bible was not a sin problem it was a Solitude problem in Genesis 1 when God created the Earth he said it is good six times once even said is very good everything God created was good and before sin ever entered the world God said there was one thing that wasn't good look at Genesis 2:18 the Lord God said it is not good for the man to be alone I will make a helper suitable for him the man had God as his best friend he lived in a perfect environment there was no sin on the Earth but God knew that he wired the man for relationship and that's not just true for Adam it's true for you and me it's true for every human being we all need relationships it's not good for us to be alone because when we get isolated our mental health declines worry stress depression and anxiety all increase when we live isolated lives it's not good for us to be alone because people who have friendships live longer it's not good for you to be alone because the quality of your life will be determined by the quality of your relationships I'll be honest with you I am an introvert I don't require a lot of friends but my personality does not negate the truth of God's word that I need friendships and my friends they mean the world to me my Life is Richer because I I have not only my wife my kids but also my friends I thank God for my friends I thank God for my small group and church no matter your personality type you need friendships you need relationships and today I want to talk to you about Ruth and her friendship with Naomi in Ruth 1: 3-6 if you want to read that on your own you can but I'm just going to give you a summary here the Bible lets us know that Naomi and her husband had two sons Naomi's husband died and she was now a single mom with two sons her two sons married moabit women one named orpa and the other Ruth 10 years later her two sons died Ruth and Naomi had some great reasons on why they should not maintain the relationship and so I want us to glean some insight from this story and so first I want to share with you three things that keep you from owning the building and man and maintaining of your relationship the first thing is pain Naomi Ruth and orpa were experienced intense grief and emotional pain due to the loss of their husbands I can only imagine their grief Naomi lost her husband and her two sons Ruth and orpa lost their husband and their brother-in-law if there was ever three people that had a legitimate excuse to isolate themselves and to avoid relationships it was these three women see pain has a way of driving us into isolation when we're hurting we tend to hide when we're in pain we come to church late and then we Dash right out the door when service is over and if you're not careful pain will drive you away from the relationships you need the most even when you're in pain it's not good for you to be alone the second thing is problems Naomi Ruth in Ora's world has turned upside down when their husbands died they didn't just lose their husbands but they lost their income the men these men worked and provided for their family and so these ladies they didn't know how they were going to buy food or pay their bills they had some serious problems and when people are overwhelmed with problems they tend to pull away from relationships pull away from from their friendships they isolate themselves have you isolated yourself because of your problems you're tired weary overwhelmed maybe you're embarrassed and you just don't want to deal with people but it's not good for you to be alone the third thing is people I know Ruth's mother-in-law wasn't perfect she made some mistakes in their relationship maybe she crossed a line and started meddling in Ruth's marital tension with her husband maybe one year Naomi forgot to buy Ruth a birthday gift I'm sure Ruth had some good reasons on why she shouldn't maintain a relationship with Naomi now that her husband was dead see one of the biggest reasons we don't build or maintain relationships with people is because people are flawed how many of you know people will hurt you frustrate you get on your nerves irritate you make you mad how many you know people can be goofy and unreliable come on lift your hand if you know any weird people come on lift your hand if you know any weird people and if you don't have your hand lifted it's because you're the weird one okay I'm just I'm joking I'm joking some of you are not owning your relationships because you are sick and tired of people you don't have any close friends because people have hurt you you're not connected getting connected at People's Church because someone disappointed you or broke your trust even though people can be weird and Goofy God said it's not good for you to be alone you still need people and so I want to share with you four lessons you learn from Ruth on how to own your friendships first lesson is this press through pain look at Ruth chapter 1 vers 8-10 it says then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law go back each of you to your mother's home may the Lord show you kindness have you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me may the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud and said to her we will go back with you to your people these two daughters-in-law were pressing through some Unbelievable pain as they wept aloud and said we want to go with you you listen to own friendships we have to press through pain in life pain is unavoidable you will have personal pain you will have people pain but even when you're going through physical emotional mental pain you need relationships when your heart is broken when you're grieving when you're hurting you need relationships people will disappoint you they'll let you down they'll get on your nerves make you mad but you still need relationships I can tell you after 15 years of being a pastor at People's Church and dealing with all types of people I have learned to develop thick skin but yet maintain a tender heart I refuse to become jaded towards people or to stop loving people and believing the best in people and building relationships with people Church you have to press through pain to own your relationships because it is not good for you to be alone number two the second lesson is be committed look at Ruth 1 11-18 but Naomi said return home my daughters why would you come with me am I going to have any more sons who could become your husbands return home my daughter I am too old to have another husband even if I thought there was still hope for me even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to Sons would you wait until they grew up would you remain unmarried for them no my daughters it is more bitter for me than for you because the Lord's hand has turned against me at this they wept aloud again then orpa kissed her mother-in-law goodbye but Ruth clung to her look said Naomi your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her Gods go back with her but Ruth replied don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you where you go I will go where you stay I will stay your people will be my people your God my God where you die I will die and there I will be buried may the Lord deal with me be it ever so severely if even death separates you and me and it says when Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her she stopped urging her orpa was like you're right Naomi you aren't going to have any more sons and even if you did I'm not waiting I mean I'm trying to get married in a year or two and have some kids and I don't blame her I don't blame her they were all in pain Naomi was bitter but Ruth clung to Naomi she was committed to her even though it was a tough season when we own our relationships we are committed during the Good Seasons and the Bad seasons relationships are hard work marriage is hard work parenting is hard work family relationships hard work Church relationships are hard work friendships are hard work so god-honoring relationships they require clinging they require being committed to one another we have to be committed to one another when we get offended be committed when someone disagrees with us be committed when you see someone's Humanity their flaws their issues be committed even though they have a different culture or perspective than you be committing be committed during this upcoming election season I've seen people walk away from their own family over an election they leave their friends they leave their Church oh God may we have the character of Christ and be committed to our relationships Ephesians 42 says be be completely humble and gentle be patient bearing with one another in love Ruth models this for us so well naom was bitter she was even a little angry at God she told Ruth multiple times to leave go back to your people I don't need you in my life but Ruth was patient with her she was bearing with her see relationships aren't all about us it's not always about what we can get out of the relationship sometimes it's about what we can give it's about how we can be there for someone when they're hurting bitter lonely confused scared or angry you have to make up in your mind I am going to bear with people Colossians 3:13 bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone for as the Lord forgave forgive as the Lord forgave you bearing with people will require you to forgive people people will hurt you disappoint you and let you down but we are called to forgive and bear with each other so look at your neighbor and say I guess I'll put up with you a little longer go ahead tell them I guess I'll I guess I'll put up with you a little longer number three the third lesson lesson have realistic expectations we we can learn so much from Ruth about having realistic expectations as we examine her relationship with Naomi Ruth knew Naomi was bitter and angry with God she knew Naomi didn't want to get remarried and have more children she knew Naomi was relocating she knew their relationship would look different now that her husband and Naomi's son was was dead I'm sure she knew that when she got married to another man it could create some challenges in their relationship Ruth had some realistic expectations when she clung to her relationship with Naomi she was committed to the Rel relationship during this new season see one of the reasons people stop owning their relationships is because so many of people have unrealistic expectations unrealistic expectations lead to frustration unchecked frustration leads to people not owning their relationships let me give you some realistic expectations about people first people are crazy all of us got a little bit of crazy in us crazy behaviors crazy habits crazy routines every night I sleep with a body pillow don't judge I cling to it I love my body pillow you got to pray for your pastor I still bite my nails when I go to a restaurant I order the same thing I am not adventurous people are crazy number two people will hurt you and disappoint you if you think otherwise you have unrealistic expectations here's what I've learned about people that I think will help you have the right expectations of them most people have good Hearts but bad practices have good Hearts but bad practices most people were never taught or never saw modeled for them in a healthy way how to deal with trauma pain loss grief disappointment setbacks and anger so they react in a way that isn't helpful to them or to their relationships and then number three relationships go through different seasons so you have to show Grace love and commitment through every season of life Ruth and Naomi were going through a new season and Ruth said I'm committed to you I'm clinging to you I'm not giving up on our relationship Church you have to have realistic expectations or you won't own building and maintaining your relationships and then number four the fourth lesson God's plan for your life is connected to people one of the amazing things about this story and really the story of the Bible is when people stay connected to people they fulfill God's plan for their life see because Ruth stayed committed and connected to Naomi and went with her to her Homeland she met and married a man named Boaz they then had a son named OED who had a son named Jesse who had a son named David the man after God's Own Heart who had a son named Solomon who was the wisest man to ever live 28 Generations after David our Messiah the King of Kings the Lord of lords was born Jesus Christ was born from the lineage of Ruth and Boaz God's plan for your life is always connected to people it's not good for you to be alone because you can't live out your life your purpose for your life all by yourself even Jesus needed people to fulfill his purpose Jesus chose 12 disciples 12 close friends to do life with Jesus knew his purpose was connected to people I wonder how many of you are missing out on God moments God opportunities open doors Your Divine Destiny and purpose be because you're not connected and committed to people you need people to fulfill your god-given purpose and so I want to give you three quick applications number one be committed to your family come on own it love your family build relationships invest forgive work through the problems don't wait on them you own it get signed up and get to our marriage conference on February 25th you can sign up out in the lobby sign up for that marriage conference

plan for your life is people and relationship and yes it's messy it's not was perfect but that's why God teaches us to forgive and to bear with one another that's why he teaches us from Ruth to cling because we need it we have to have Godly relationships the right relationships and so own it be committed to your family be committed to your friendships be committed to your church family

least sorry it's second to last second to last sorry I don't you know the iPhone I mean it's cool right it's cool like you don't have to worry about having those flashlights on your bedroom and on the first floor second floor if power goes out you got your iPhone you know what I mean you just flip on that flashlight or you you you wave it we've never done that in worship I don't know why in church I don't know but anyway so you got you got your iPhone light here and then the next light last but not least Christmas lights who love Christmas lights oh my family we love Christmas Christmas lights we love getting some hot chocolate yummy Starbucks drinks and driving around and looking all the Christmas lights around uh Indianapolis just reminds us of our our favorite season the Christmas season time with family and uh uh yummy food and and and our household is whole made from scratch cinnamon rolls oh I can't wait to go to sleep tonight to wake up tomorrow and get some homemade cinnamon rolls but it's just a great time of family memories and it just it's about Christmas the birth of Christ every Christmas morning we read the Christmas story together never want to forget the reason for the season and the Christmas story is really all about light last weekend we studied John 3:19 it says this is the verdict light has come into the world the light it's referring to there is Jesus Jesus he was born that's what Christmas is all about light has come into the world but men love Darkness instead of light because their deeds were Lal if you missed last week I encourage you to watch it we talked about how darkness is deceiving and how our world loves Darkness but Jesus came he came to be a light to help us overcome the darkness and John 8:12 it says when Jesus spoke again to the people he said I I am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life and so today I want to share with you three ways this truth of Jesus being the light of the world can impact your life the first truth is this light invades Darkness Christmas is all about Jesus the Son of God who left heaven and came to Earth he was born of a virgin named Mary Jesus came as the light of the world he didn't say he was the light of Christians or he was the light of good people or that he was the light for all those that have their lives together no no no no no he said he is the light of the entire world and to understand the power of these words you have to know the context in which Jesus said them and the verse is leading up to this powerful statement in John 8 what what what was happening was that a woman caught in the act of adultery was brought before Jesus and these Pharisees and these teachers of the law they brought these this woman before Jesus to condemn her these religious people wanted to condemn this woman even today religious people love to condemn others but when the religious people when they brought these condemning accusations they wanted to Stone this woman they brought her before Jesus it's interesting the Bible says that Jesus got down and he started to write in the dirt come on anybody else glad that Jesus isn't afraid to touch some dirt come on anybody else glad that Jesus isn't afraid to touch the dirty issues in our life that Jesus he he began to write in the dirt and Jesus didn't condemn her see so many people have the wrong view of Jesus Jesus didn't come to condemn you over your sin he came to save you from your sin John 81011 it says Jesus straightened up and asked Heroman where are they has no one condemned you no one sir she said then neither do I condemn you Jesus didn't condemn her because he didn't come in the world to condemn people but to save people John 3:17 for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him Jesus shines his light on your life not to condemn you but to convict you of your sin so that he can save you from your sin no matter what you've done Jesus loves you and he wants to save you from your sin number two here's the second truth light pushes back the darkness Jesus doesn't want to just invade your darkness and forgive you of your sins he also wants to push back the darkness in your life so that you can live a different life Jesus came not only to forgive you but to change you to give you a new life John 81 and 12 no one sir she said then neither do I condemn you Jesus declared and then he said go now and leave your life of sin when Jesus spoke again to the people he said I am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life when you follow Jesus he doesn't just forgive you of your sin but he pushes back the darkness in your life the light of Jesus changes your life it's just like how this the this flame is changing this candle the moment that the candle was lit this candle changed this candle now shares the goodness of light this candle now it's changing and and and it shares a a pleasing a nice Aroma come on be like a good smelling candle you know what I mean light that thing up and just a smell going everywhere and that's what happened this light it's changing it the flame when it touches the wick this candle now is bringing the goodness of light and it's bringing this good smell Hebrews 12:29 it says that our God is a consuming fire see when the light of the world Jesus Christ enters your life his fire begins to change you from the inside out your life begins to to look more and more like Jesus your life begins to Prova provide light to a dark World your life begins to be a pleasing smell a beautiful smell and pleasing Aroma in a stinky world listen you don't have to take the same habits and Hang-Ups into 2024 if you give your life to Jesus his light will push back the darkness in your life and begin to change you Jesus was born to save you and change you third truth number three light brings life you know we learned in grade school that without the sun without Sunshine nothing on Earth could live right if you take away all the sun all the life on Earth it would perish and just as the sun s n is necessary for physical life the son s o n of God is necessary for spiritual life you can't experience real life without knowing Jesus as your lord and savior John 8:12 when Jesus spoke again to the people he said I am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of Life Jesus saves us from forgives us changes us and gives us real life this Christmas season I want you to have real life listen life doesn't come from presence under the tree life doesn't come from having your family visiting your home life doesn't come from a Christmas dinner or pecan pie or even homade cinnamon rolls real life comes from knowing Jesus John 14 six Jesus answered I am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me real life comes from knowing Jesus 1 John 5:12 he who has the son has life he who does not have the Son of God does not have life listen you will never find real life in money and degrees you'll never find real life in marriage and kids you'll never find real life in dating in houses or your 401k account you'll never find real life from the Thrills and power and PR prominence and Prestige listen if you think those things are giving you real life you have no idea what you're missing out on because you're missing out on the joy that only comes from Jesus you're missing out on the hope that only comes from Jesus you're missing out on the peace that only comes from Jesus you're missing out on the Forgiveness of all sins that only comes from Jesus Jesus the light of the world is where you and I find real life let's pray if you'll bow your heads and close your eyes with me this Christmas season I want everyone in this room to have have real life and real life comes from Christ and Christ alone and if you're here today and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ I want to give you the opportunity right now to receive the greatest gift you could ever receive on this Earth it's not a gift under the tree it's not a gift given by a loved one it's a gift only given from God through Jesus Christ it is the gift of Salvation Jesus is the only way the truth and the life and if you're here today and don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ or maybe maybe you've wandered away maybe 2023 has been unimaginable it's caused you to drift maybe even turn your back on God I want you to know today he has not turned his back on you he loves you he's waiting for you with open arms for you to receive the gift of Salvation so if you're here today you need to make Jesus your lord

hH39PvZKER8,well today as we're continuing our series we are people's church and i would encourage you if you've missed any of these weeks you can go on our youtube page just search people's church indianapolis and you can listen to any of those messages we've just been talking about who we are as a church and today the title of my message is we are a place that celebrates diversity we are a place that celebrates diversity in our text today the majority of it is going to be coming out of acts chapter 15 and let's look at verses one and two it says certain people came down from judea to antioch and we're teaching the believers unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by moses you cannot be saved this brought paul and barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them so paul and barnabas were appointed along with some other believers to go up to jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question and so what's happening here is a group of jewish christians were saying the gentiles couldn't be saved unless they followed their custom of circumcision and this caused a sharp dispute in the church jesus or excuse me jews and gentiles were very different see they spoke different languages jews worshipped only yahweh gentiles generally were polytheistic they believed in many gods jews were required to keep kosher with their food gentiles were able to eat non-kosher foods like pork and shellfish so the the gentiles come on they were milling eating some smothered pork chops grubbing on some baby back ribs give me my baby back baby back baby back grubbing on some bacon cheese burgers and the jews they could not and would not eat those things jews were circumcised and gentiles were not and the jewish christians were telling the gentile christians they couldn't be saved until they got circumcised i'm trying to imagine when i got saved at youth group i remember just bawling my eyes out it was just a god moment i'm just trying to imagine in that moment the pastor coming up and tapping me on the shoulder and saying actually you're not saved yet what do you mean i'm not saved we need to take you to room c what's in room c oh we just we just gotta do a little procedure it's just a a little surgery i'm like what serge what yeah yeah yeah yeah you gotta come and you gotta get circumcised first what oh no oh i would have been out of that church and i would have been gone peace out i'm good i'm good i am good and this is what was going on the jewish christians were telling the gentile christians they couldn't be saved unless they got circumcised the jews were making it hard for the gentiles to have a relationship with god and be a part of the church they weren't about diversity they were about division and the same type of division still happens today in the church people are trying to keep others out of church and away from jesus because of their own customs and traditions you can't be a part of our church unless you're the same skin color as us unfortunately the most segregated hour every week is still sunday morning during church but i'm glad that people's church is being a part of bringing healing to hearts bringing different skin colors together to lift up the name of jesus some are saying you can't be a part of our church unless you vote like us are rich like us middle class like us poor like us you can't be a part of the church unless you're vaccinated like us unvaccinated like us wear a mask like us don't wear a mask like us you can't attend church unless you wear a suit and tie like us wear skinny jeans like us like gospel music like us you can't be a part of church unless you sing out of a hymn book like us and we see division being created we see people saying don't post on social media about the latest curtain event and then others say you better post on social media about the latest current event how you can't attend our church unless you watch cnn news like us or watch fox news like us pastor you better preach about the most recent headlines in your sermon pastor you better not preach about the most recent headlines in your sermon division churches and christians have been finding every little reason possible to be divided and this isn't the heart of god one of the reasons we started people's church 20 years ago was to be a house that celebrates diversity diversity hasn't happened by accident we've been very intentional to create a culture that celebrates diversity here at people's church we don't tolerate diversity we celebrate diversity we are a place that celebrates diversity and so i want to give you four reasons we celebrate diversity number one is this we celebrate diversity because god celebrates diversity in his church let's look back at acts 15 verse 7. it says after much discussion peter got up and addressed them brothers you know that some time ago god made a choice among you that the gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe see peter reminds the church that god is the one who chose to allow the gentiles to receive salvation through christ god chose the gentiles god chose diversity diversity is god's idea it's the heart of god look at acts chapter 11 verse 17 and 18 it says so if god gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the lord jesus christ who was i to think that i could stand in god's way when they heard this they had no further objections and praised god saying so then even to gentiles god has granted repentance that leads to life god is the one that chose to include the gentiles into his salvation plan god chose to make both jew and gentiles a part of his family and so anyone who tries to keep people from following church or excuse me from following jesus and attending church because of tradition skin color age gender politics economic status is fighting against god because god chose diversity it's the heart of god god chose diversity and so does people's church number two we celebrate diversity because god's heart is for us to be one god's heart is for us to be one let's look at acts 15 verse 8 and 9. it says god who knows the heart showed that he accepted them by giving the holy spirit to them just as he did to us he did not discriminate between us and them for he purified their hearts by faith god didn't discriminate because he wants every man and woman to be his son and daughter he wants all of us to be a part of his family god wants his family to be one in mind and in heart a few years ago my mom's side of the family all came to indianapolis to celebrate my grandpa's birthday and it was just a cool moment just to see this room full with so many aunts and uncles and cousins and nephews and i remember looking around and seeing my grandpa he is he's italian and from new york fully from new york and fully italian oh he loves the yank you talk about the yankees all day long so my grandpa's there i had an aunt from australia that was there from down under i had an aunt who was asian that was there over in the corner my mom and her sister are speaking french have nieces and nephews running around that are mixed had an uncle there from belgium had my big tall red-headed uncle from texas there hanging out had my stepdad who's hispanic from california there and i just looked around and just saw so many different people and our family together and just made me smile do we see everything the same or do we always are we all seeing everything eye to eye absolutely not but we love one another and we're there for one another and so i love just seeing us there all together laughing getting along unified one of the key ways we please god and make him smile is when the church is one when we're unified look at john chapter 17 verse 21-23 it says that all of them may be one father just as you are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me i have given them the glory that you gave me that we that we that they may be one as we are one i in them and you and me so that they may be brought to complete unity then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me one of god's greatest desires is for the church to be one everybody say one jesus said that when the church is won then the world will know that god sent me in a huge way the love of god is revealed to the world is through a unified church one of the reasons the world isn't attracted to jesus and the church is because the church can't get along we need to constantly pray this prayer that jesus prayed lord make your church one bring us into complete unity because a divided world needs a unified church a unified one a church of one romans 12 5 it says so in christ we though many form one body and each member belongs to all the others colossians 3 15 it says let the peace of christ rule in your hearts since as members of one body you were called to peace and be thankful god god help us to be one so that the world will know that you sent jesus ephesians 4 4 it says there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called lord make us one make us unified not uniformity but unified we are different and that's okay listen being different it is a beautiful thing we are stronger because we are different and all of our differences they make us better and more effective if we bring our differences together to be one and so at people's church we celebrate our differences we celebrate our differences number one we we celebrate the different races and cultures galatians chapter 3 verse 26 and 28 it says so in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith for all of you who are baptized into christ have clothed themselves with christ there is neither jew nor gentile neither slave nor free nor there is male or female for you are all one in christ jesus paul is saying don't make your race and culture your most important identity don't make your age social status political status economic status your most important identity your most important identity is that being a child of god i'm white just in case you didn't know i'm white i love my culture i love my heritage pastor herbert our founding pastor he's black he loves his culture he loves his heritage my mom is french she loves her culture she loves her heritage my stepdad is hispanic he loves his culture he loves his heritage but our most important identity and the identity we're most proud of is we're children of god we're children of god church it's okay to be proud to be african irish asian hispanic middle eastern hawaiian german or whatever race or culture you're from but your most important identity is a child of god your race and your culture shouldn't divide the church the bible says in genesis that we're all made in the image of god that means no matter your skin color where you were born you were made in god's image there is no superior race there is just the human race that was made in the image of god and as christ followers were a part of god's family number two we celebrate the different gifts first corinthians chapter 12 verse four through five it says there are different kinds of gifts but the same spirit distributes them there are different kinds of service but the same lord we celebrate all the different gifts at people's church we need you to use your gifts in god's church so that we can see more changed lives your gift matters and your gift is important thank you to all of you that use your gifts

gray hair we thank with that wisdom that experience that we need you we love we celebrate you we celebrate all of you who are middle aged we need your wisdom too we need your experience that you add to our church we celebrate our adults and our young adults all your gifts and creativity and wisdom we celebrate it we celebrate our youth and our kids all your passion your zeal your creativity and your tech savviness oh we need it and we celebrate it listen our kids and students are not just the church of tomorrow they are the church of today and here at people's church we have a deep conviction and commitment to invest jesus and biblical values into our kids and students we're passionate about raising up world changers that are going to leave a legacy come on our kids and our youth they're going to be the ones that are going to lead the charge to see more changed lives in the next 20 years amen they matter lis this is why we go all out every sunday every sunday in our kids ministry we teach our kids about jesus and they worship every single sunday in our kids ministry birth through fifth grade this is why every wednesday night 7 p.m we have our youth ministry epic for students in the 6th through 12th grade and we're we're we're teaching we're passionate about helping them discover their their god-given purpose and plan for their life that's why we have a young adult small group we want to see young adults growing and thriving and and hopefully we'll be able to start a ministry called recharge where we can just see more and more young adults coming and growing and thriving in their faith and and living out the life that god has for them here at people's church we celebrate the different generations let me give you a third reason as to why we celebrate diversity now we celebrate diversity because it shows we have the love of god in our hearts it shows we have the love of god in our hearts there's way too much hate and i'm not just talking about the world i expect the world to hate our biblical values and convictions jesus said that would be the case look at john chapter 15 verses 18 and 19. it says if the world hates you keep in mind that it hated me first if you belong to the world it would love you as its own as it is you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the world and that is why the world hates you the world is going to hate us what's disappointing is to see how many people who call themselves christians that are so mean ugly and hateful christians using social media as a weapon to create hate and division christians quoting scriptures out of context to create hate and division amongst different races and different people groups i i want you to hear what the bible says look at first john chapter 2 verse 9 and 10. it says anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light and there is nothing in them to make them stumble first john chapter 4 verse 20 it says whoever claims to love god yet hates a brother or sister is a liar for whoever does not love their brother and sister whom they have seen cannot love god whom they have not seen john 13 35 by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another for all listen for all of you who are truly christians you have to stop hating and causing division with people who lit look different vote different and believe different than you you have to stop using your personal experience and upbringing and personal viewpoints and perspectives as a weapon or as an excuse to hate others hate always separates and divides it keeps us from coming together it keeps us divided and it keeps us from listening and having empathy see biblical love will sit down and listen to someone else's experience perspective and viewpoint love builds a relationship love listens that's why our small groups are so important make sure you get in one this summer a place where people can listen and learn and grow and listen we can listen and still disagree and do it in love see sometimes we may feel compelled to share our biblical values and convictions boldly but bold doesn't mean hate bolt doesn't mean hate we love we love we love number four we celebrate diversity because it builds bridges and tears down walls god has called us the people's church to be bridge builders not wall builders bridges help get people in walls keep people out a church should be putting up searchlights to get people in not security lights trying to keep people out and god has called us at people's church to make it as easy as possible for people to have a relationship with jesus and to worship at church we don't want to make it hard for people to come to christ look back at acts 15 19. he says it is my judgment therefore we should not make it difficult for the gentiles who are turning to god listen we live in a society where people are hurting people are looking for answers they're looking for freedom they're looking for hope they're looking for peace they're looking for love they're looking for god and they look to christians and the church and the church can make it so difficult for people who are trying to know god i wonder [Music] if any of you have a cookie jar in your house or maybe you remember growing up with the cookie jar and as you can see there's only a couple cookies left in there and as long as this cookie jar was within my reach as a little boy i'll be tearing them cookies up my parents wouldn't get any cookies so you know what they started to do so i wouldn't eat all the cookies so i couldn't get to all the cookies they put the cookies up high they put them up on the top shelf and i couldn't get to the cookies a lot of people are doing this with jesus trying to put jesus out of reach here at people's church we do not put the cookies on the top shelf no no we're we're putting the cookies on the bottom shelf we're putting we're trying to make it as easy as we possibly can for people to come to jesus to meet jesus to have their life changed by jesus but what's happening right now is people they they put you don't want to drop the cookies people they put cookies on the top shelf and they make it difficult for people who have a different skin color different age different culture different political beliefs different upbringing different view on covid different view on what church service should look like and i am committed here at people's church to pastor a church that is for everybody every single person every age everybody everybody everybody he might be like pastor why are you so passionate about making a church for everybody because everybody needs forgiveness everybody's going to spend eternity somewhere everybody needs new life through christ everybody needs a spiritual family for when they're going through difficult times everybody needs friends everybody needs biblical solutions to life's problems when jesus said for god so loved the world he wasn't just talking about white people black people brown people old people young people he wasn't just talking about democrat people republic people or independent people he wasn't just talking about rich people poor people vaccinated people unvaccinated people he was talking about everybody every single person matters to god the gospel is for everybody salvation is for everybody and because god wants everybody to be a part of his spiritual family and so at people's church we are a place that celebrates diversity so everybody everybody can come to jesus everybody can come to church and meet jesus
li_v8xrZSbQ,well the title of this series as we celebrate our 20-year anniversary is we are people's church and last week we shared how we are a place of principle a place of prayer in a place of power and so every week we're just highlighting who we are at our core our vision our values and today i want to talk to you about how we are a place where it's okay not to be okay we are a place where it's okay not to be okay a number of years ago me and my wife and two of our children they were really young at that age we met with another couple at cracker barrel for breakfast come on anybody like cracker barrel breakfast that's one of my favorite spots there and so we were there for some cracker barrel breakfast and uh we're uh eating with this couple fellowshipping having a great time and all of a sudden we smelled something fowl and uh my my wife nudged me kind of gave me the look like was that you i'm like let me she was like did you pass gas i'm like no i didn't what are you talking about and but man we could smell something was oh something smelled really bad and then we looked over at our child two years old in the high chair and there was green diarrhea flowing up out of the diaper and dripping down the high chair oh it was nasty y'all it was a mess we ruined everybody's breakfast everybody after that day some people may not want to go back to crack or barrel and for any of the parents in the room come on anybody ever had that experience where your child made a mess messed themselves maybe wet their pants and it's just this all big mess and you know what how do you respond when that happens you know what i mean are you like what did you do i know you're only two but you could have told me your stomach was hurting why didn't you tell me you had diarrhea what get up out of that high chair take your behind to the restroom and clean don't you come back out until you are completely cl you are just nasty you ruined breakfast for everybody in here come on nobody is gonna react that way right nobody's going to react that way we picked up our child well i should say my wife picked up our child her stomach's a little stronger than mine she picked it she taken him to the restroom droplets and we all are cleaning up the floors and the high chair but when that happened listen we didn't leave our child in its mess we didn't yell at them for their mess we loved them and we cleaned them up even though it was an inconvenient mess we cleaned them up loved them even when they were an inconvenient mess how does god respond to us when our life is a mess this is so important to answer because how god responds to messy people is how his church should respond see jesus oftentimes gets a bad rap a lot of people think that if they personally meet jesus that when he sees all of their mess that he would not like them he would not accept them he would reject them he would want nothing to do with them he may turn up his nose at them he may look at them like they're like why did you do that but no no no no that's not jesus of the bible jesus would meet you right where you are love you where you are and help you in your mess because jesus meets people right where they are at people's church we meet people right where they are we say it like this it's okay not to be okay come on look at your neighbor just just tell liberate them tell them it's okay not to be okay it's gonna look at your second choice cause they're feeling left out now they're like oh my goodness let them know it's okay not to be okay you can come to people's church with your hurts habits and hang-ups so we're going to look at how jesus responds to messy people and i want to give you three reasons why we are a place where it's okay not to be okay three reasons why we are a place where it's okay not to be okay number one the first reason is because jesus pursues us while we are not okay he pursues us while we are not okay let's look at matthew chapter nine verse 9. it says as jesus went on from there he saw a man named matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth follow me he told him and matthew got up and followed him did you catch this matthew did not go to jesus jesus went to matthew jesus pursued matthew see so many people have this perception that humanity has to pursue god if they want a relationship with the creator of the universe yet the story of the bible and jesus is never a story of man pursuing god it's a story of god pursuing man matthew didn't go looking for jesus jesus went looking for matthew jesus pursued matthew even when he wasn't okay see matthew was a tax collector and you may be like well why is that important well see during this time rome had major military power and rome would go into countries and they would dominate them and they would take over areas like israel and jerusalem then the roman government they would set up tax districts and they would hire chief tax collector to hire people to be a chief tax collector over a providence or district then that chief tax collector had the authority to go collect taxes and so they had a quoted a meet by the roman government and after they met that quota they could keep the rest and so tax collectors they would force people to overpay their taxes so that they could pocket the rest matter of fact chief tax collectors they became very wealthy by ripping people off that there are many jewish people that lost businesses and properties because they were being ripped off by the chief tax collectors and so these tax collectors they were despised by the jewish people there's no way in the world they would want to have a meal with them at cracker barrel or anywhere else let alone there's no way they would want to worship with them in the temple they were despised they were considered the worst of sinners and so here's matthew he's collecting taxes at a tax booth his jewish neighbors despised him and now jesus is pursuing this despised tax collector and he didn't say to him matthew i need you to go retire i need you to leave this wicked job and then come follow me he didn't say i need you to go get your act together and then come follow me no no jesus of the bible he pursues us in the middle of our hurts habits and hang-ups you see the same thing with levi look at luke chapter 5 verse 27 it says after this jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of levi sitting at his tax booth follow me jesus said to him jesus pursued a rotten tax collector named levi look at luke chapter 19 verse 5 it says when jesus reached the spot he looked up and said to him zacchaeus come down immediately i must stay at your house today jesus pursued another wicked tax collector named zacchaeus god pursues sinners john chapter 6 verse 44 it says no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws them and i will raise them up the last day you can't even come to god the father unless god draws you god pursues us when we're not okay luke 19 10 it says for the son of man came to seek and save the lost i'm thankful that jesus pursued me when i was a mess when i was lost when i was living wild when i was looking for love in all the wrong places listen i'm not here to give you my test of baloney i want to give you my testimony i was the hot mess express i was broken busted and disgusted and jesus pursued me in the middle of my mess anybody here that can testify that jesus pursued you in your mess come on let's give him praise and thank him that in the middle of our mess the messiest messes inconvenient mess jesus pursued us number two the second reason we're a place where it's okay not to be okay it's because jesus desires to be a part of our lives while we are not okay he desires to be a part of our lives while we're not okay back to matthew 9 9 it says as jesus went on from there he saw a man named matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth follow me he told him and matthew got up and followed him jesus pursues matthew and he says follow me i can just see peter james and john who jesus just told in matthew 4 to come follow him i can imagine them being there with jesus and seeing him walk up to the tax collector's booth and be like oh oh gee oh yeah jesus about to get him and then all of a sudden jesus says hey matthew i want you to come follow me and they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa jesus whoa whoa hey pow wow powwow huddle up huddle up hold up hey jesus you know who that is yeah that's matthew yeah he's tax collector i know no no you don't know jesus like i know you are cool and love people hate him they despise he is a he is robbing people he calls people to lose their businesses and their jobs and jesus says it's okay i wonder what matthew was thinking matthew's sitting there texas for rome texas for me and then jesus comes up yes sir and jesus says come follow me matthew you had to be sitting there thinking this the jewish carpenter does he want me to follow him behind the alley like what like where does he want me to these people hate me jews don't lie that i'm i mean i can't imagine the thoughts running through his mind i know he he's probably thinking about i know i heard he's good and he heals and he's probably going to tell me just how messed up i am and tell me all i'm just a thief and i'm a cheat and i'm a steal and i'm a liar and i guarantee matthew's having thoughts been there in no way trying to tell me there's no way he'll ever accept me no way i could be a part of his kingdom i mean he's supposed to be the son of god he's probably gonna tell me there's no way that i could be in his presence or or follow him and i guarantee you matthew matthew is having all these thoughts he says come follow me and i want you to see what jesus does in the very next verse matthew 9 10 it says while jesus was having dinner at matthew's house jesus said come follow me i want to have dinner with you i want to hang out with you i want to spend time with you jesus doesn't tell matthew come follow me you nasty sinner you good for nothing heathen child of satan no he says matthew i wanna have dinner with you i wanna go into your house i wanna hang out with you wow jesus builds a relationship with matthew he gets to know matthew he doesn't say go clean up and then follow me go clean up and then i'll come to your home and eat and get to know you no no jesus says follow me right where you are just like you are see there's a huge misconception that people have to come into jesus's presence and to church service a certain way that you got to come cleaned up and dressed up neat nice and have your life all together but this isn't the jesus you see in the gospel the message of jesus is come messed up now go clean up come messed up come with your hurts your habits and your hang-ups not go clean up and you see this over and over again look at luke chapter 15 verse one and two it says now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear jesus sinners lost people broken people they were attracted to jesus it says but the pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered this man welcomes sinners and eats with them yeah jesus welcomed sinners jesus said come to me just like you are come messed up not go clean up see jesus wants to begin a relationship with you right where you are he loves you and he welcomes you right where you are look at luke 19 verse 6 and 7 it says so he came down at once and welcomed him gladly zacchaeus gladly welcomed jesus he was attracted to jesus and the bible says all the people saw this and began to mutter he has gone to be a guest of a sinner sinners were attracted to jesus but the religious people of the day were complaining because jesus was hanging out with sinners see churches typically fall into two categories they attract sinners or they complain about sinners they attract sinners or they complain about sinners and i want people's church to be a church that attracts sinners listen we are a hospital for broken hurting and the lost we strive to make jesus attractive to broken lost and hurting people we want to make jesus attractive from the streets to the seats come on somebody that's why every sunday out on 82nd street we got our dream team waving at folks waving them in because we want to make jesus attractive from the streets to the seats when you pull into the parking lot you'll get another wave when you walk into the door two three or four or five people there waiting we we're waving at you greeting you we want people to be greeted five times before they even get to worship in the message that's why we got our kids dream team back there loving on kids and doing our kids services every single week because we want to make jesus attractive to our children from the streets to the seats that's why we have our worship team in all of our dream everything we do every single sunday is to make jesus attractive from the streets to the seats because people need jesus i want people's church to be one of the friendliest churches on the planet so we attract people who need to experience the love of god i want to be a place where everyone is welcome no matter who they are or what they've done because that is the heart of jesus look back at luke 5 verse 29 through 30. i want to show you something else it says then levi held a great banquet for jesus at his house and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them but the pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners matthew 9 11 when the pharisees these were the religious people the church people saw this they asked his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners did you notice that these tax collectors were so hated they got their own category you catch that everybody else was just sinners but they're like why does your teacher eat with these tax collectors and sinners can you imagine if you had your own category oh my goodness jesus is eating with those sinners and teachers oh oh jesus is eating with those sinners and those horrible coaches oh can you believe it don't do it jesus stay away jesus is eating with those sinners and lawyers and doctors oh jesus i can't believe it he was eating with those sinners and preachers oh jesus eating with those sinners and those waiters those sinners and those crazy engineers oh my jesus is eating again with those sinners and those stay at home moms can't believe jesus would do that and this happens in church sometimes church people can get so religious and try to keep certain people away from you you are too messed up to come to jesus to be in church no no what's wrong with you no you no no no no you can't come to jesus you can't go to church you got issues you can't be coming you can't go to church like that but that is not the message of jesus jesus says no matter who you are what you've done come follow me come messed up not go clean up come on come in your inconvenient mess not get cleaned up come with your hurts your hang-ups and your habits not go clean up and the pharisees asked a question we must answer today why does jesus eat with the worst of sinners why does jesus welcome sinners and jesus answered why in the next verse it also leads to our third reason why we're a place where it's okay not to be okay number three is because jesus cleans up what is not okay jesus cleans up amen what is not okay look at matthew chapter 9 verse 12 it says on hearing this jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick jesus said i welcome and i eat with sin the worst of sinners because it's not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick and when jesus was saying this he wasn't just referring to the tax collectors and the the sinners that he was sitting having dinner with no no he was talking to everybody present he was saying you're all sick yes even you pharisees you're not as okay as you try to portray you are also sick all of you were sick and i came for sick people we've all been sick pastor are you saying i'm sick no i'm not jesus said you're sick but we all have hurts hang-ups habits and issues and here's the truth of the matter come on we've all had sick thoughts some of us have been sick in our finances sick in our marriage seeking a friendship sick in relationships sick at your job sick at school sick habits sick addictions and jesus said i came for sick people not to judge and condemn them but to help them jesus didn't come to beat you up he came to clean you up jesus didn't come to beat you down he came to lift you up and to clean you up to heal you up luke chapter 5 verse 31 and 32 it says jesus answered them it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance jesus says come to me messed up not go clean up because when we come to jesus messed up jesus cleans us up jesus leads us to repent of our six-way sick ways jesus is so amazing he meets us and he loves us right where we are but he doesn't leave us where we are with his power he comes and he changes us right where we are let's look at zacchaeus again in luke 19 verse 5 and 10 it says when jesus reached the spot he looked up and said to them zacchaeus come down immediately i must stay at your house today and so he came down at once and welcomed him gladly all the people saw this and began to mutter he has gone to be a guest of the sinner but zacchaeus stood up and said to the lord look lord here and now i give half of my possessions to the poor and if i have cheated anybody out of anything i will pay back four times the amounts that kias he follows jesus just like he was and now he's repenting of his sin what jesus does in your life is so amazing when you come and follow him just like you are he cleans us up and jesus said to him today salvation has come to your house because this man too is the son of abraham for the son of man came to seek and save the lost jesus goes to zacchaeus house and his whole house gets saved when jesus and sinners get in the same house life change happens at people's church we want to be a place where jesus and sinners are in the same house it's okay not to be okay but when you meet jesus you won't stay that way jesus will give you a new way a healing way a better way a way that will change your life forever and ever and ever it's okay not to be okay but when we meet jesus you won't stay that way because jesus changes our lives jesus leads us to salvation jesus leads us to repentance jesus leads us to holiness jesus leads us to purity we're a place where it's okay not to be okay because when jesus and sinners get in the same place lives are changed forever it's okay not to be okay because jesus he pursues us while we're not okay he wants to be a part of our lives when we're not okay he doesn't say go clean up no no he says come messed up they hear people's church we say the same come messed up come with your hurts your hang-ups your habits your flaws come with all your mess so you can meet the only one that can clean it up meet the only one that can save you heal you restore you he's not telling you go away go clean up and then come back to me no no he's saying please come with all your mess and all your issues and i'm gonna help you clean up what's not okay
uhy3Jk6LcjQ,and uh today we're continuing our series called Miracles nothing is too hard for God at People's Church we believe that God still does Miracles he still heals bodies he still delivers people from bondage and addiction he still does the impossible no matter how dire your situation may look or God is able to perform a miracle amen and we've been studying God's word learning about the key ingredients to a miracle week one we learn that you need a need the one common denominator for every Miracle is you have to have a need week two we learned that you need to ask the Book of James says you have not because you don't ask God week three we learned that you need to have faith you need to ask in faith we learned a lot about faith last week and if you missed that message or any of them please go to our YouTube page and watch those but we learned that faith and believing are not the same thing that Faith requires action faith is key to experiencing miracles and today is week four and I want us to learn the eight biblical ways to receive a healing some of you need a miracle but you don't understand the different ways that God heals and so I want to teach you what the Bible says about how God heals here's the first way number one pray for healing pray for healing I want to share with you some effective biblical ways to pray for your healing first is this pray to the father in Jesus name pray to the father in Jesus name look at John 16 23 Jesus said in that day you will no longer ask me anything very truly I tell you my father will give you whatever you ask in my name there is power and authority in the name of Jesus come on sometimes that's all I can say is Jesus and there is power and authority in his name the name above all names John 14 12-14 Jesus said very truly I tell you whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing and they will do even greater things than these because I am going to the father and I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son you may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it pray in Jesus name secondly pray specifically look at Matthew chapter 20 verse 32-34 Jesus stopped and called them what do you want me to do for you he asked Lord they answered we want our sight and the Bible says Jesus had compassion on them touched their eyes immediately they received their sight and followed him what do you want Jesus to do for you be specific praise specific prayers thirdly pray with faith Mark 11 verse 22-24 it says have faith in God Jesus answered truly I tell you if anyone says to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen it will be done for them remember last week we learned that faith is not just believing that God can it's believing that God will therefore I tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours when you pray believed you have received what you are praying for I often times I do this by thanking God I've been thanking God God I thank you that you have a new building for us in a prime location so that we can reach more people for the good news of Jesus Christ God I thank you in advance and my kids are going to serve you and love you and follow you all the days of their life God I thank you that you're going to bless each one of my children with Godly spouses God I thank you for my health in Jesus name I pray prayers of faith not prayers of doubt next pray with other Christ followers look at Matthew 18 19-20 it says again truly I tell you that if two of you on Earth agree about anything they ask for it will be done for them by my Father in heaven for where two or three Gather in my name there I am with them there's power when two Christ followers agree together in prayer praying with your small group is powerful I'm believing for miracles to happen in our small groups when you come to 21 days of prayer and fasting and you pray with your church family it's powerful listen when you come at the end of service and you allow our prayer Dream Team to agree with you in your prayer it's powerful there's powerful it's or excuse me there's power when you join your faith and your prayers with other Christians and for some of you your healing it's on the other side of the prayer of agreement there's some in here you're a private person you've been praying privately for God to heal you but God's been nudging you to have some Christians agree with you in prayer do it there's power in agreement let me give you the second biblical way to receive a healing and that is through the gift of healing and First Corinthians 12 Paul talks about nine gifts of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit gives Christians different gifts so that we can minister to others and one of those gifts is the gift of healing look at First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 it says to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by that one Spirit God has given some Christians the gift of healing some of you may have this gift when you pray for people you see them healed maybe it's when you pray for people in your small group or at your workplace or at school or at your home you see God heal them people are healed by God through the spiritual gift of healing the the Third Way is command healing let me explain something you see throughout the Bible is a command to receive healing the Holy Spirit prompts someone to command a healing and then the person is healed look at Luke 18 verse 42 and 43 Jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has healed you as a command healing immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus praising God when all the people thought they also praised God look at Acts chapter 9 verse 33-34 it says there he found a man Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years Aeneas Peter said to him Jesus Christ heals you get up and roll up your mat immediately Aeneas got up there are times God will prompt someone to give a command for healing to someone and the person responds in faith and they're healed this ties very closely to the next Point number four is instruct with an Act of Faith let me explain we see people receiving healing in the Bible when someone is prompted by the Holy Spirit to give a sick person an instruction to do some type of Act of Faith the person follows the instruction and then they are healed look at Matthew 12 13 it says then this is Jesus then he Jesus said to the man stretch out your hand so he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other look at Luke 17 verse 12-14 as he was going into a village ten men who had leprosy met him they stood at a distance and called out with a loud voice Jesus Master have pity on us when he saw them he said go show yourselves to the priests and the Bible said as they went they were cleansed on the other side of their Steps of Faith was healing look at John chapter 9 verse 6 through 7 after saying this he spit on the ground made some mud with his saliva put it on the Man's eyes go he told him wash in the pool of Shalom the words mean sent so the man went and washed and came home seeing how many all know it better be God if it's involving some spit and mud you know what I'm saying hey don't you be spitting on some mud and rubbing it on me I'll give you a head butt in the name that's nasty nasty I don't understand why Jesus did this but it worked now for some of you wild Christians we are not starting a spitting and mud ministry here at People's Church okay so don't get any crazy ideas Pastor I got a new small group I want to lead no but what I do want you to see is that sometimes the Holy Spirit Will prompt someone to give an instruction to someone and when they follow the instruction God brings healing to their body last year we heard about Pastor Herbert's wife Tiffany she's had a gluten allergy for years and years and years and there was a Revival service and the speaker said if you need a healing in your physical body I want you to come forward and Pastor Tiffany she came up she came forward She's Come many times but this time she came forward and she was healed her response in faith healed her again I don't understand at times uh why someone's healed and why someone isn't but I just know this is a way that people are healed by God let me give you a fifth way rebuke any demons causing sickness now I'm not one of those people who believe that a demon is a cause of everything I don't believe a demon is behind every tree all right people love to hide behind the devil the devil made me late to work he made every single one of those stop lights red no he didn't you left late all right you just left late stop blaming the devil that one the devil that was you but it's important to understand that there is a real devil and he can be behind sickness the the first thing you need to understand is that sickness was not part of God's original plan let me let me share with you a few things first sin and sickness entered our world because of the fall of Adam and Eve you can read about this in Genesis 3 on your own sickness is one of the realities of living in a fallen broken and sinful world secondly some sickness because of sin John 9 2 his disciples asked him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind how you know some sickness is because of sin that because of the sin of being addicted to drugs that could cause sickness in your life I mean I know the sin of gluttony can cause some sickness if you're eating too many cheeseburgers and fried chicken and ice cream or you're not taking care of your temple your body hey you know what I mean so some sickness can be from sin next some sickness is so the glory of God can be revealed John 9 3 neither nor neither this man nor his parents sin said Jesus but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him sometimes sickness is not because of sin it's not your fault it's not your parents fault it's not hereditary it's because we live in a fallen world where sin and sickness are prevalent and God can use a sickness and the healing that he brings to bring glory to his name now some sickness is because of demonic influence and we see this in the Bible Luke 4 11 14 it says Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute when the demon left the man who had been mute spoke and the crowd was amazed Matthew 17 verse 14-15 when they came to the crowd a man approached Jesus and knelt before him Lord have mercy on my son he said he has seizures and his suffering greatly he often falls into the fire or into the water look what verse 18 says it says Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of the boy and he was healed at that moment there are several more scriptures I could read to you about how demonic influence was behind sickness but I I want you to understand there are times you need to rebuke a demon to experience healing let me give you the sixth way biblical way to receive a healing that's laying hands on the sick another biblical way that we see people receive healing is through the power of a touch throughout the old New Testament you see blessings Miracles and healings take place with a touch let me give you an example from the Old Testament how the power of God moved through a Touch look at Deuteronomy chapter 34 9. it says now Joshua son of none was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses laid his hands on him so the Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses he laid his hands on Joshua and Joshua was filled with the spirit of wisdom let's look quickly at healings that took place in the New Testament through touch the bible also calls it laying hands Matthew 8 3 it says Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying I am willing be cleansed and immediately his leprosy was cleansed Mark 141 moved with compassion Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him I am willing be cleansed immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed Mark 7 33 after he took him aside away from the crowd Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears then he spit and he touched the Man's Tongue Jesus healed a few times with spit and this one's even nastier than the first one he spit and touched a man tongue like that's just I mean I guess if I'm gonna let anybody's touch me it's going to be Jesus but that is it that is the only spit and but listen I I want you to see the power of a touch not the spit the power of a touch Luke 22 51 but Jesus answered and said stop no more of this and touched his ear and healed Him Luke 4 40 when the sun was setting the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness and laying his hands on each one he healed them acts 28 8 his father was sick in bed suffering from a fever and disintery Paul went in to see him and after prayer placed his hands on him and healed him there's power when someone lays their hand on you and prays for you God uses the laying on of hands to bring healing number seven is anoint with oil James chapter 5 verse 14-15 it says is anyone among you sick let them call the Elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord after the prayer offered in faith and excuse me and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well the Lord will raise them up if they have sinned they will be forgiven if you study this out in the Greek the word oil in the Bible is talking about bacon oil come on honey I got them little cans your mama's got them cans on the on the oven they got that little bacon grease that they leave it in there and it turns into oil and and they use that to cook that that's the kind of oil that the Bible is talking about I'm just kidding y'all I'm just kidding somebody like man Pastor Chris are going deep I didn't know that bacon oil was used I'm just playing with y'all I'm just playing with y'all there's actually nothing special about the oil it's a point of contact that can represent the anointing of the Holy Spirit the oil represents and God chooses to use anointing people with oil and prayer as a method of bringing healing and then number eight the eighth biblical way to receive a healing pray again Pray Again Pastor I've done all these and I still haven't been healed what do I do now Pray Again keep on praying don't give up keep believing keep trusting don't stop praying Pray Again Mark chapter 8 verse 23 through 25. he Jesus Took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village when he had spit on the Man's eyes and put his hands on him Jesus asked do you see anything the Bible says he looked up and he said I see people they look like trees walking around verse 25 it says Once More Jesus put his hands on the Man's eyes then his eyes were opened his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly Jesus prayed for the man again he prayed a second time it's important to understand that God heals instantly and God heals progressively your healing may happen in a moment or it may happen over time the key is to keep praying keep trusting keep believing keep praying keep asking keep trusting keep believing because God is the Healer he is the Healer listen the method and the person don't bring the healing God is the Healer so keep asking God keep trusting God don't give up on God keep praying and here's the best news ever if you're a Christian you will be healed because if you don't get healed on this Earth you'll get healed in Heaven Come on is anybody thankful for heaven no more disease sickness No More Pain No More Tears perfect body in heaven and listen I know I can teach this message and I know it could be easy to doubt because there's been things in my own life where I've prayed these different methods our son Cohen keeps getting these fevers we'd laid hands on him we've anointed him with oil we've asked other Christians to help prayed we have prayed specifically I've prayed a prayer of command a prayer over him and we keep praying we've been praying for years and he's still not healed and I don't understand it all but as long as I'm still living I'm going to keep praying I'm Gonna Keep trusting listen on my worst day if God doesn't answer another prayer I have heaven and that's enough if he doesn't answer another prayer I've been forgiven and that's enough if you don't answer another prayer I have Jesus and that is enough and I'm just here to tell you today keep praying keep believing Pray Again Pray Again Pray Again feel bow your heads and close your eyes with me

words I wish I would have I wish I would have made that decision I wish I would have done that differently I wish I would have ended that relationship or friendship and one of the things I've said is

have known more about myself before I got married I wish I would have known more about parenting before I had kids I wish I would have known how much my past pain and issues was impacting my soul my life in my relationships and because I didn't know I have some regrets and I want to share some of my biggest regrets with you I regret looking at pornography I didn't know the power of pornography the damage it would do to my mind my thought life how addictive it is I regret exposing my mind to it I didn't know garbage in garbage out I didn't know that Romans 12 says we need to be renewing the power of renewing our mind I regret having sex before marriage I didn't know the power of sex I didn't know about saving myself before marriage I didn't know First Corinthians 6 18 says sexual sin is a sin against your own body I regret not discovering how unhealthy I was I was so used to being unhealthy that I thought that my unhealth I thought my issues were normal this is just the way I am and I thought since I saw people that I was doing better than that I was okay I mean they're crazy I'm just a little crazy you know they're crazy all the time I'm just I'm just crazy sometimes and I regret the people I heard because of my past pain anger and issues my past pain and anger impacted the people I loved the most the number one person is my wife it took me years before I recognized my unhealth I regret my pride and how I treated people not listening not valuing what others had to say not being patient I regret some ways I parented it's too harsh getting frustrated it's fear-based I did not understand how important it was to maintain a relationship with my kids I regret having an offended spirit I regret being disrespectful deceiving and disobedient to my parents and in this series I want to help you live with fewer regrets Church you're going to learn some things you may not even know you need to learn and I truly believe that these series of messages are going to help you live a life of fewer regrets come on how many of y'all want less regrets in 2023 and I'm going to tell but I do less regrets in 2023 and the key verse for today's message is Proverbs 26 11. it says as a dog returns to his own vomit so a fool repeats his folly two years ago we finally broke down and got our daughter Callie a dog for Christmas got a picture of when the day we picked him up she named him peanut butter because she thought his fur was the color of peanut butter and so we now just call him peanut peanut has been in our family for over two years and there have been moments when I'm sitting in my room or downstairs where peanut is there and all of a sudden he stands up and I hear I'm like oh Lord Jamey Kelly I don't do vomit y'all and before my wife or before Cali could come and clean it up I look and peanut is eating his vomit just eat it up is gone I'm like oh there are times I've seen peanut in the backyard sniffing his poop and I'm like what's that dog doing and then he eats it I've seen him sniff other dogs poop nasty peanut don't you be licking me no no don't you be licking my face with that tongue no no no no what's so interesting about dogs is they will vomit and they will go right back to the very thing that made their stomach upset and eat it again they are drawn to their own vomit they are drawn to the very thing that just moments earlier made them sick to their stomach and we humans can be a lot like dogs because we have the propensity to return to the very thing that made our lives sick we returned to unhealthy habits we return to bad behaviors we return to stinking thinking we return to Our Sick sins we return to our vomit over and over and over again we enjoy it for a moment or for a season but then it makes us sick but then we return and do it again maybe you've made the same New Year's resolutions year after year I'm done with this it's over I'm changing but then you find yourself right back in the same vomit again we can all find areas of Our Lives that we repeatedly are drawn back to some type of destructive Behavior maybe it's a destructive relationship maybe it's destructive shopping habits overspending overeating debt drugs alcohol abuse pornography anger and rage and outburst maybe it's video games social media it's destructive Sports chocolate food the cell phone Pride gossip lying the comparison game compromise in cutting corners and throughout this series I want to help you not go back to the same vomit in 2022 and 2021 and the 2000s and the 1990s with God's help I don't want you to continue to go back to the vomit and living a life full of regrets God wants you to go from vomit to Victory we don't want to keep going back to that vomit and living a life of regrets but we want to make some changes so that we can live in a life of Victory and so let me give you three I wish I would have that will keep you from returning to your vomit number one is this is I wish someone would have told me have you ever been at a restaurant and you've seen somebody getting nasty with the waiter or the waitress or the person preparing their food before they have their food oh that's not going to end up well you don't do that before they give you your who knows what they are doing to your food now or mixed up in that soup or covered up with the bun like no I'm not like I've seen people I'm like oh they don't read they don't even know that is not gonna end up going well for you there are some things that you're doing that's not working for you it's destructive to your life and you don't even realize it nobody's ever told you that's not working for you so you keep going back to the vomit and damaging your life because you lack knowledge the Bible says it like this in Psalms or excuse me in Proverbs chapter 10 verse 21 it says the lips of the righteous nourish many but fools die for lack of sense Isaiah 5 13 it says therefore my people have gone into captivity because they have no knowledge Hosea 4 6 it says my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge some of you are in captivity you're being destroyed because of a lack of knowledge you keep returning to your vomit because you don't know what's that it's making you sick it's not working for you and nobody's ever told you that's not working for you well today I want to tell my church family a few things I want you to know I want you to have knowledge number one you don't have to live undisciplined being undisciplined is destroying your life you can be disciplined in school and get your education you can study for the test you can can be disciplined and keep a job you can get to work on time you can do your job well secondly you don't have to live in the Sin your sin your Disobedience to God's word is destroying you you don't have to live with the addiction the addiction it's giving you momentary pleasure but it's destroying your life and your relationships here's another one you don't have to stay broke you can get out of credit card debt you can pay your bills on time you can have money in the bank you can have money in retirement you can break generational poverty you don't have to have toxic and drama-filled relationships you can have peace in your relationships you can have relationships that bring you Joy you can have a peaceful marriage and a peaceful home you can have God honoring relationships you don't have to live bitter and with resentment you can forgive you can be healed and made whole you don't have to live on an emotional roller coaster you can have a sound mind you can have sound emotions I wish someone would have told me and so I I hope I'm helping you today number number two is I wish I would have pursued knowledge there's another group of people who keep going back to your vomit because you don't have an appetite for knowledge and wisdom you don't pursue knowledge and wisdom you don't have a desire to know better so that you can do better you ever heard someone say I'm doing the best I know how man that's a scary place to be that mentality is saying I'm limited by what I know and what I've experienced no you you don't have to be limited by what you know and experience you can gain knowledge let me give you three things I wish I would have known earlier in life it would have kept me from some major regrets first I wish I would have desired wisdom Proverbs chapter 4 verse 5 through 8. it says get wisdom everybody say get wisdom get wisdom get understanding do not forget my words or turn away from them do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you love her and she will watch over you the beginning of wisdom is this get wisdom though it cost you all you have get understanding cherish her and she will exalt you Embrace her and she will honor you get wisdom read books listen to a podcast get mentors in your life that are where you want to be spiritual mentors that you can get wisdom it's one of the perfect reasons to get into a small group in a small group you can get wisdom and grow and get knowledge and get understanding get in a small group this spring secondly I wish I wasn't a know-it-all instead of getting wisdom and understanding most people are focused on giving their wisdom and understanding they're focused on speaking their wisdom more than gaining their wisdom come on happy I know that we can't talk and listen at the same time you can do it and the Bible says James 1 19 it says be quick to listen that's why God had to give us two ears because we quick to speak that's not what the Bible says quick to listen slow to speak don't listen just to respond listen to learn listen to grow listen to change thirdly I wish I would have pursued getting feedback on my blind spots first I wish I knew I had some blind spots for years I didn't understand that we don't see things as they are we see them as we are I don't see everything about myself about others oh the world as clearly as I think I do and neither do you have a lot of perspectives about a lot of things in life but they aren't all accurate perspectives my perspectives and viewpoints aren't always accurate none of us see everything as clearly as we think we do and listen it changed my life when I allowed other people to speak into my perspective in my viewpoints when I asked others what are some of my blind spots what are the things that I don't see I began to realize I have some serious blind spots and so do you we all have blind spots are you allowing trusted people speak into your blind spots or are you defensive super sensitive do you invite people trusted people godly people to speak into your plight blind blind spots but ask them this please help me see the me I don't see we all have a me we don't see and so position your heart to get feedback and receive it and to to listen don't get defensive but listen to learn listen to grow listen to change Proverbs 15 14 says a wise person is hungry for knowledge Proverbs 1 7 it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction Proverbs 3 verse 13 through 18 it says blessed are those who find wisdom and who gain understanding you have to find wisdom you have to chase it you have to ask for it you have to pursue it from others gain understanding it says for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold she is more precious than rubies nothing you desire can compare with her long life is in her right hand in her left hand are riches and honor her ways are Pleasant ways and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life to those who take hold of her those who hold her fast will be blessed come on you gotta gain and go after wisdom and understanding you gotta grasp it you gotta go to hold on to it come on we break that fast on January 29th the same way you gonna snatch up that donut you gotta snatch up wisdom and gain understanding so you can listen to learn to grow and to change and then number three number three I wish I would have applied what I heard a lot of people have a whole lot of knowledge but they don't have a whole lot of wisdom let me explain knowledge is information wisdom is application knowledge is information wisdom is application you can know something but that doesn't mean you're applying it some of you you keep returning to your vomit because you don't apply what you're learning you like gaining knowledge you like people giving you advice you love learning but you can love learning and not love applying some people's desire to listen and learn is a 10. but their willingness to apply what they hear is a one there's a high desire to listen but a low desire to apply they don't do anything with what they hear they know a lot but they don't do a lot you can know a lot about love but be a jerk you can know a lot about having a servant's heart but be consumed with selfishness and not serve others you can know a lot about being a great friend but live isolated from others you can know a lot about living a holy life but live wild ratchet and nasty you can know a lot about having a great marriage and your marriage be a mess don't confuse knowledge and wisdom information versus application well again knowledge is information wisdom is application here's another thing I also wish I spent more time changing instead of blaming and justifying I used to blame and justify my behavior you can make excuses or you can make changes but you can't do both if you keep making excuses no matter how good the excuse is you will keep returning to your vomit church this is your year to stop returning to the vomit I wish someone would have told me Chris pay the price to change versus paying the price of staying the same you can't avoid paying the price but you'll either pay the price of changing or the price of staying the same and the price of staying the same is way more painful I can tell you my life is so much better because I've gone through the pain of changing than dealing with the pain of staying the same the pain of staying the same almost wrecked my marriage the pain of staying the same almost wrecked my parenting the pain of staying the same almost wrecked my life and my Purity and my relationship with God but the pain of changing and it was tough and it was challenging has got me away from the vomit and has put me on a path towards Victory I wish someone would have told me look at Proverbs 1 verse 28-32 it says when they cry for help I will not answer though they anxiously searched for me they will not find me for they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the lord they rejected my advice and paid no attention when I corrected them therefore they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way painful choking on their own schemes painful for simple turns turn away for me to death fools are destroyed by their own complacency painful listen this is your year to change no more blaming no more blaming others no more blaming the world no more blaming your family no more blaming your situation no more blaming your job no more excuses you gotta say I am not going back to the vomit no more vomit no more vomit no more vomit I'm Gonna Learn I'm gonna learn to grow I'm gonna learn to change I'm Gonna Change I'm done with the vomit and I want to live in the victory the victory the freedom that God has for me I'm gonna get wisdom I'm Gonna Learn God's word and apply it
E0qYdS2DgY0,well today we are continuing our series called till he appeared and before i get into the message come on anybody else glad that the colts appeared last night got that w jt jay jonathan taylor appeared through that hole and ran for that touchdown i was getting a little nervous showing being honest i was getting a little nervous and he took it home to the promised land but we're going to talk about jesus now all right jesus until he appeared and our text for this series is isaiah chapter 9 verse 6. it says for to us a child is born to us the son is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace the last two weeks we've covered what it means for jesus to be a wonderful counselor a mighty god today we're going to focus on everlasting father jesus is our everlasting father i absolutely love being a dad i love having quality time uh with my children i love seeing them grow i love going on daddy daughter dates with my with my daughter i love taking out my sons and having one-on-one quality time and then i enjoy getting them on the putt-putt court and showing them who is king come on dad is still king uh it's not gonna last forever but right now i still reign in putt-putt i remember uh when we dedicated uh each one of our children to the lord a matter of fact my children were dedicated in three different states my oldest son jace he was dedicated at our church that we were on staff at in ohio and then my daughter callie she was dedicated in oklahoma city when we were on staff at people's church and then my youngest cohen was dedicated right here at our indianapolis campus and so i got a i got a buckeye i got a sooner and i got a hoosier all right all three of my children uh dedicated in all three steps and uh it's crazy how fast uh your children grow up you know and as they've grown up listen it's been challenging it hasn't been perfect listen there have been challenges with my children but i love them and i love being a dad and it's like you blink and they just they just shoot up matter of fact i came across this picture when we first moved back to indianapolis uh this was in 2014 came across this picture of my my two oldest there's there's jace and callie and oh look at them loving on each other they that doesn't know what's happening but i praise the lord right then and there they were they were loving on each other they're so little and then before you know it it is 20 21 and then bam another child entered the equation i mean cohen wasn't even in the last one but jace and callie just growing up uh so fast and just love being a father and 700 years before jesus was born isaiah prophesied that jesus would be an everlasting father 700 years ahead of time god knew that we needed an everlasting father so 2 000 years ago he sent his only son jesus to the world to be our everlasting father now i want you to know that jesus is our everlasting father but he is not god the father there is one god that exists in three persons god the father god the son and god the holy spirit we call it the trinity jesus is the everlasting father but but he's not god the father so everybody say everlasting father everlasting means that jesus has no beginning and he will have no end he existed before he came to earth and he will exist forever he always existed and always will jesus is eternal jesus is everlasting look at john 1 verse 1 through 3 it says in the beginning was the word the word there is referring to jesus and it said the word was god and the word or excuse me the word was with god and the word was god he was with god in the beginning through him all things were made without him nothing was made that has been made colossians chapter 1 verse 16 and 17 it says for in him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things have been created through him and for him against talking about jesus it says he is before all things and in him all things hold together john 17 5 it says and now father glorify me in your presence with the glory i had with you before the world began he's eternal everlasting john 8 58 it says very truly i tell you jesus answered before abraham was bored i am in revelation 1 8 it says i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end says the lord god i am the one who is who always was and who is still to come the almighty one jesus is everlasting and not only is jesus everlasting but he is a father he's the father of creation he's the father of eternity he's the father of mankind he's my father and if he's not your father i hope he becomes your father today and so i want to share with you four reasons jesus is a good good everlasting father four reasons jesus is a good good everlasting father the first reason is this jesus cares about you jesus cares about you you may be thinking to yourself does god really care about me does he really care about what i'm going through does he really care about what i'm facing in life matter of fact there may be some in here that you would say i i feel all alone and i want you to know that jesus sees you and he cares he sees you and he cares luke chapter 12 verse 6 through 7 it says are not five sparrows sold for two pennies yet not one of them is forgotten by god indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered don't be afraid you are worth more than many sparrows jesus says if you don't think i care about you you are wrong i care about a cheap bird and you are mur worth way more to me than any bird i think the old song says it best why should i feel discouraged why should the shadows come why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and home when jesus is my proportion my constant friend is he his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me and i sing because i'm happy and i sing because i'm free i don't know if i can go any higher for his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me jesus cares about you look at first peter verse 5-7 it says give all your worries and cares to god for he cares about you give jesus all your worries your pain your heartache all of the challenges give them to jesus he cares about you he wants to comfort you support you guide you and protect you jesus is an everlasting father and he cares for you the second reason that jesus is a good good everlasting father is jesus loves you jesus loves you anybody remember the little children's church song jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so listen you need to know how much god loves you you may be asking well why would god love someone like me it's because god is love god doesn't love you because of who you are god loves you because of who he is and god's love isn't based on performance your success your good deeds your accomplishment it's not based off your title your money your friend group your family name or your good looks it's not based on any of that no matter how bad how nasty how jacked up messed up your life might be god loves you he loves you romans 5 8 it says but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us while we were still sinners while we were making mistake after mistake while we were an enemy of god jesus loved you see god's love it is unconditional it's sacrificial it's unlike anything you can experience on this earth and listen you can't do anything to earn it and since you can't do anything to earn god's love there's nothing you can do to lose it he loves you period romans 8 verse 38 through 39 it says for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord god loves you god loves you god loves you god loves you i'm here to tell somebody today that god loves you i know you may have made some bad decisions but god loves you i know you're addicted but god loves you i know your life has been hard but god loves you i know you feel unlovable but god loves you jesus is our everlasting father and he loves you he loves you number three the third reason that jesus is a good good everlasting father is that jesus disciplines you see god disciplines us because he loves us he wants what's best for us look at proverbs chapter 3 verse 11 through 12. it says my child don't reject the lord's discipline and don't be upset when he corrects you for the lord corrects those he loves just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights i know for some of us today that word discipline can put some shivers down our spine that's not a very positive word i remember growing up one of my friends uh in his right in his front yard by his front door they had a switch tree some of y'all know something about that somebody like what's a switch tree i didn't know what it was either until one of my friend one of my friends and his sister got in trouble and their parents said go get me a switch and it better be a good one i'm like hey man you need to burn down that tree bro like why whoo i can remember my friend his sister didn't want to get a switch so she let him get it so he went out there he was coming in with the and then she ran out there it was crazy y'all i was like man that tree's of the devil i thank the lord there is no switch tree at my house because my little behind would have gotten tore up so i i know that word doesn't always bring some positive thoughts come on how many on here you got some some whoopings and you got talked to at the same time don't you ever talk to yo who do you think you are christopher paul i mean syllables you're like oh i mean i know right now when i talk about jesus disciplines you it's some painful memories that might be coming but listen jesus only disciplines his children because he wants what's best for us and praise the lord he doesn't have a switch tree all right our our good good father he disciplines us to correct us and to develop us i'm glad god doesn't just let me wreck my life without convicting me warning me and correcting me i thank god that even when i didn't want to listen god was like no no chris don't go there don't do i'm trying to protect you will you trust me and i am so thankful when i see how god's discipline has protected me and watched over me and listen there been times where i didn't listen you know what i mean and then god just let me go on my way and experience the consequences and i was like lord i'm sorry i'ma listen next time i i apologize i see what you were saying i see why you were trying to lead me away from that but you got to know listen he disciplines because he loves he's an everlasting father he is a good good father and then let me give you the fourth reason the fourth reason is this is that jesus provides for you he cares about you he loves you because he loves you he disciplines you and he provides for you matthew 7 11 it says if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him this particular scripture is talking about god the father but i love how it shows the heart of god to provide for his children i love my kids and because i love them i provide for them i make sure there's food in the house and i make sure there's clothes on their table and i make sure they have a bed and a and a roof over their head listen because i love and only love my children they got braces in their mouth you know what i mean like i i'm like hey do you want a car or braces or anyone uh man braces are expensive no joke but because i love them there are braces in their mouth and i give gifts and when i see my kids hurting i hurt and i want to help them and encourage them when i see someone coming at them i want to protect them because i love them and i want you to know that jesus loves you the same he wants to put the same way i provide for my kids he is an even greater provider jesus literally wants to provide for all your needs he wants to provide for your physical needs financial needs your relational needs your mental needs your emotional needs and most of all your spiritual needs see god wants to give you the greatest christmas gift ever and that's the forgiveness of your sins john 3 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life god gave us jesus over 2 000 years ago so that our sins can be forgiven and today all you have to do is give your life to jesus confess him as your lord and savior and he'll forgive all your sins i'll never forget high school i was looking for that love that hope i was looking for the meaning of life and i was looking in all the wrong places partying drinking girl just look into all of that and none of it filled the hole in my heart matter of fact i attended church for a whole year and just kind of ignored the holy spirit i ignored jesus but then finally one day i said i've tried everything else let me try jesus and it changed my life forever i didn't understand it all my life was still a mess but his love forgiveness and hope it changed everything when i experience the everlasting father he is a father far greater he has done more for me than i could ever ask or imagine way more than i deserve way more but that's who he is he's a good good everlasting father and if you haven't given your heart and life to jesus christ if you don't know him as your father i want to give you that opportunity right now
YN3D21m8EUk,well today i'm wrapping up or i'm not wrapping up i'm sorry we got a couple more weeks of throwback two more weeks this week and next week actually three more pray for him we got three more three more weeks of throwback september 11th we have the series speed kills your pastor will be the lord is already working in my heart uh when it comes to that message but today we're continuing our series called throwback and the title of my message today is work your weakness work your weakness at times if i'm honest oftentimes i have moments where i feel weak and insecure and i just want to be transparent with you today about some of my greatest insecurities some of my greatest weaknesses one of my greatest insecurities is that i am naturally an introvert i put my extrovert on on sunday i give it all i got but naturally i i don't feel comfortable in settings with lots of people um a lot of times i don't know what to say a lot of times i wish why man why aren't i quicker when i were wittier why don't i have the gift of gab why can't i just be that with me i see all these pastors they're the life of the party and they can just talk to anybody no problem and here i am sweating and and worrying i'm like lord why would you have me be a pastor when when deep down inside i'm you made me an introvert and i have wrestled and struggled with this insecurity at times it has caused me to feel like i'm inadequate unworthy and at times it's caused me to feel like i'm ineffective another one of my weaknesses is i battle anxiety and i've struggled as a matter of fact i've hid this weakness for many many years i'm supposed to be a pastor i'm supposed to be this man of god i'm not supposed to have anxiety defeat me i'm not supposed to have anxiety take over and i'm i'm i've had panic attacks and i still to this i'm better than what i've used to be god's done a great work but i still have to battle anxiety and it's tough and it's hard and it's messed with me and it's a weakness and it's an insecurity there's times i don't feel like i'm good enough sometimes i feel like i'm not a good enough preacher not a good enough leader and i struggle i have times where i feel weak what makes you feel weak insecure or inferior is it your appearance your hair used to be mine i just let it go it's not coming back i've laid hands on my head and ask god with anointing oil to make it grow god said let it go but it could be appearance your nose your eyes too short too tall too big too small maybe your voice maybe it's your education you're not making good grades at school maybe you feel like you don't have enough education you feel unqualified maybe it's your financial status you don't have enough money you have so much debt you're struggling to pay your bills and you feel weak maybe it's your relationship status you're single and you want to be married but things aren't happening quickly or maybe you're married and wish you were single marriage has been hard and you feel like you can never be what your spouse needs and you feel weak maybe it's your job or career you thought you would have a better job by now you thought you'd be promoted by now you hate your job and career and you feel so week here's what i want you to learn today when you feel weak and insecure you are a prime candidate for god to use god specializes in using weak and insecure people and so i want to learn this principle from an old testament hero named ehud look at judges chapter 3 verse 15. it says again the israelites cried out to the lord and he gave them a deliverer ehud a left-handed man the son of gira the benjamite the israelites sent him with tribute to egglog eglon king of moab now the bible points out that ehud was left-handed and this was a big deal in the bible days especially to be a left-handed leader and so today i'm going to give you three lessons from a left-handed deliverer three lessons from a left-handed deliverer number one is this god wants you to embrace your uniqueness god wants you to embrace your uniqueness being left-handed was unique back then and it still is today approximately 10 of the population is left-handed come on we're my left-handed brothers and sisters where am i left-handed okay okay probably about ten percent in the room left handed and and ehud he was not only left-handed but he was from the tribe of benjamin now this is interesting because benjamin means son of the right hand so ehud is left-handed but he's a part of the tribe of the right hand i think it's safe to say ehood was unique and the reality is we're all unique and we have to embrace our uniqueness come on tell your neighbor you're unique not weird come on tell them you're unique not weird you're not weird you are unique did you know there are more than three million differences between your dna and anyone else's in the world including your parents and siblings there are over 8 million 300 000 possible combinations of 23 chromosomal pairs that make each person and each of these chromosomal pairs contains anywhere from dozens to thousands of different genes the number of possible genetic combinations is 4 to the 3 billionth power your calculator can't even compute that high all right and so there is your math and science lesson from pastor chris if your brain is hurting like mine i'm sorry we'll have one of these teachers help us out but what what i want you to understand is you are unique and you're unique by god's design it's not by accident look what genesis 1 27 says it says god created mankind in his own image in the image of god he created them male and female he created them some of you need to hear this today god created you in his image and he doesn't make mistakes people may have told you that you're worthless or junk or trash or weird a mistake no no no no you're unique you're created in the image of god god made you like you are on purpose and for a purpose psalm 139-14 it says i praise you because i'm fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well you are fearfully and wonderfully made you're amazing you're a masterpiece you are unique and it's by god's design embrace your uniqueness i've had to learn to embrace my uniqueness god made me the way that i am god gave me my introverted personality god gave me my gifts and i don't want to change who god made me to be i want god to develop me so i can be the best version of me i want to be the best chris smith i can be for god nobody can beat me at being me and god made each of us unique because he has a unique purpose for each of us to accomplish look at romans chapter 12 verse 4 and 5 it says for just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function come on we're unique so in christ we though many unique form one body and each member belongs to all the others the bible says we are one body of christ but we have different functions we all have a unique person purpose listen nobody else on this planet was created to start people's church indianapolis back in 2015 except for chris and jamie smith that was our god-given unique purpose and god has called chris and jamie smith to impact specific people we are created to see you your family and your friends saved discipled and become more like christ i'm the only dad created to raise jace kelly and cohen and if i don't fulfill my unique purpose many lives will not will will not be all they could and should be and god created each of you with a unique purpose to impact specific people and if you don't fulfill your unique purpose many lives will not be impacted by the love of god god created you uniquely to make an impact on specific lives as a teacher a principal a college professor a scientist a business owner an engineer in the medical field as a singer or musician technology or i.t or as a lawyer or parent and friend listen even in our church god has given you unique gifts and a unique purpose to impact specific people and if some of you don't serve in pc kids or epic student ministry there will be kids and teenagers who won't be impacted the way they could be if you don't serve and lead a small group they're going to be people in our church family who don't connect get connected and grow in their faith the way that they should and listen i'm not i'm not trying to put you on a guilt trip but what i want you to understand is god has given you unique gifts to impact specific people for his glory god wants you to embrace your uniqueness number two is this the second lesson god qualifies the unqualified god qualifies the unqualified the the tribe of benjamin was the smallest of the tribes of israel this alone was a reason for many to disqualify ehud from being a leader in israel listen to what saul says before he became king of israel in psalm first excuse me first samuel 9 21 saul answered but am i not a benjamite the smallest tribe of israel and is not my clan the least of all clans of the tribe of benjamin why do you say such a thing to me ehud was from the smallest tribe and the tribe's name means son of the right hand and he's left-handed this is what i would call unqualified times two being left-handed in that society meant he was weak at a disadvantage and unqualified people would not have chosen ehud to deliver israel from the enemy because being right-handed was a sign of strength and power you see this throughout the bible look at exodus 15 6 it says your right hand lord was majestic in power your right hand lord shattered the enemy isaiah 41 10 it says do not fear for i am with you do not anxiously look about you for i am your god i will strengthen you surely i will help you surely i will uphold you with my righteous right hand psalm 17 7 it says show me the wonders of your great late love you who save by your right hand psalm 44 3 it was not by their sword that they won the land nor did their arm bring the victory it was your right hand your arm and the light of your face for you love them psalm 110 1 it says the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool at your feet luke 22 69 but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god in colossians 3 1 it says since then since you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god although the right hand was a sign of power and strength although the tribe of benjamin means son of the right hand god chose and used a left-handed man a man that most would have disqualified i can only imagine what he had thought he's at the smallest tribe he's the only one that's left-handed and god calls him who me sure you don't want one of these right-handed brothers and sisters god says i want you can imagine he felt weak and felt unqualified you know we all have reasons why we didn't feel unqualified maybe you feel unqualified because you're single maybe because you're married maybe because your children are too small or too old maybe because you're a single parent or divorced maybe because you're new to church or you got a jacked up family maybe because of physical illness maybe you feel unqualified because you're too old or you think you're too young or you've been abused or you didn't finish your education maybe you feel unqualified because you you lost your job listen god qualifies the unqualified look at first peter chapter two verse nine it says but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation god's special possession that you may declare the praise of him who called you out of darkness and into his wonderful life whether you are left-handed or right-handed you are chosen by god no matter your personality you're a royal priest no matter your mistakes or failures you're a holy nation no matter your gpa in school accolades achievements your bank account your career or your position you are special to god people's church hear your pastor today you are chosen by god stop disqualifying yourself stop tearing yourself down stop thinking you're a loser stop thinking you're a nobody stop saying you can't be used by god you are uniquely made in god's image to accomplish a unique purpose that will impact a specific people god qualifies the unqualified and then number three the third lesson we can learn from a left-handed deliverer is god displays his power in our weakness what many considered to be ehud's weakness was the very thing god used to deliver israel from an evil king look at judges chapter 3 verse 16 through 23 it says now ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit long which was strapped to his right thigh under his clothing he presented the tribute to eglon king of moab who was a very fat man after ehud had presented the tribute he sent on their way those who carried it but on reaching the stone images near gilgal he himself went back to eglon and said your majesty i have a secret message for you the king said to his attendants leave us and they all left ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace and said i have a message from god for you as the king rose from his seat ehad reached with his left hand drew his sword from his right thigh and he plunged it into the king's belly even the handle sank in after the blade and his bowels discharged ehad did not pull the sword out and the fat closed in over it then ehud went out to the porch he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked him see when ehud went to visit the king they would have checked his left thigh they would have never expected a left-handed man they would have been expecting a right-handed man and so they would have checked his left thigh to see if there was a sword there but god had a plan he was using a left-handed man and so because they did not check his right thigh ehud was able to take out the knife and to kill the enemy listen you need to understand what the world saw as a weakness god saw it as an opportunity to display his power that's what god does look at second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 it says but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in your weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that christ's power may rest on me god loves to display his power in our weakness the very thing that makes you weak is the very thing god wants to use to display his power through your life god loves to work through our weaknesses because he gets all the glory give god your weakness and let him display his power come on you got to work your weakness you got to work that left hand i'm working that 900 i got on my s.a.t i'm i'm working my weakness of having an introverted personality i'm working my weakness and not feeling like i'm enough as a pastor or a leader i'm i'm working with my weakness of anxiety and god is displaying his power in my life through my weakness and so you need to work your weakness work that left hand god is going to display his power for your life because you're working your weakness look at isaiah 40 29 it says he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak give god your weaknesses and he's going to increase your power come on god's gonna put his power on your sour god's gonna put his ability on your liability god's gonna take his super and he's gonna put it on your natural and he's gonna do the supernatural through your life and your weakness you have to work your weakness you have to work your weakness as the keys come up i want to give you just two next steps two practical steps to take to work with your weakness see too often we feel disqualified the enemy wants us to feel unworthy that we cannot make a difference and so here's two steps you can make the first step is this listen would you lead a small group there are specific people that need you to lead a group we don't have enough groups at people's church we'll never have enough groups there's not enough marriage groups men's groups women's groups young adults groups singles groups single moms groups activity exercise groups you name it there's not enough because there's still so many people in our city and in our world and in our family that need community and love and relationship and we would love to take whatever your passion is and to help you start a small group for our fall semester it starts september 11th would you step out in faith come on would you put the sword on your right hip and would you give your left hand to god even with all your weaknesses and insecurities and say god use me i'm telling you he wants to use you unless you will show you how easy it is we'll train you will walk through you and walk through it with you and so you can sign up today you can just text in to pc groups to 9400 you'll get a link click the link fill it out or even on the lobby you can stop by our small groups table we have all kind of uh uh trainings coming up where we can show you because listen god listen we are better with you than without you i'm just telling you right now we are better with you leading a group than without you leading a group [Music] another step you could take is would you join the dream team more people serving means more changed lives it's as simple as that people how to pastor how do you reach more people how do we how do we reach more losses with more people as with more people us with you we are far better with you than without you with your weakness and insecurities would you step out would you sign up you can text pcgt to go on our growth track class that starts in september we'll help you discover your gifts help you find the right ministry for you will you step out in faith you are called god made you with your unique personality and with unique gifts to serve for specific people there are some people we won't be able to reach and minister to until you're willing to step out and lead that group or join the dream team whether it's behind the scenes or out front just smiling and welcoming people to people's church god wants to use you to make a difference listen god created you to be in the game he didn't create you to sit on the sideline the enemy would love for you to stay on that sideline with your left hand looking at all your weaknesses and all your insecurities and god says my power is perfect in your weakness if you will step out and you will get in the game you're going to win we're going to see victory i'm not only going to use you but i got something i'm going to do in you that you would never know and imagine until you step out in faith i bet you ehud was nervous walking up with that knife on his right thigh and the guards come to pat him down and they pat down his left side nothing there he's thinking oh jesus and they're like you may enter [Music] they didn't check my right side and then he walks in can you imagine god's about to use me to deliver israel left-handed nobody and he didn't play no he didn't even pull that sword out he grabbed his he just left it in there to god be the glory god use me for a victory i can imagine just the feeling and the experience and let me tell you you'll never have it and experience it until you're willing to step out and put that sword on your on your right hip and use you in your weakness and say god here i am my weakness is it all make your power be made perfect in my weakness and you'll see god do a miracle through you and use you in ways you never could imagine the same way he did with e-hud a left-handed man from the tribe of benjamin
FKHKV9oIM0A,well today I'm continuing our series stay in your lane and the title of the message I want to preach to you for the next few moments is working hard to prepare for your purpose working hard to prepare for your purpose as a young boy I not only remember what it was like to wrestle with the question what is my purpose but I also remember the moment in which I actually discovered my purpose and then began taking steps to actively fulfill my purpose uh just my personal experience I was really young when I discovered what my god-given purpose in life was I remember being uh growing up in church I would go to summer camp as a teenager and uh when you've gone to Camp long enough as like a student or a leader you kind of get like you know how every night of Camp is going to work like they kind of have like one or two goals they want to accomplish which with each service and so always the last night of camp they're trying to get you fired up on fire for Jesus you just had the most incredible week of your life as a teenager and now you're about to be sent right back to home your family your job your school you need to be on fire for Jesus be bold about your faith right so I remember the last night of camping y'all I grew up like old school Pentecostal if you couldn't tell uh but I did okay so the type of camps I went to y'all we gave like specific altar calls for everything like he at people search we're just like hey if you need prayer come down to the front get prayer right no no no no no no that is not what we did at church camp it was like if you need prayer for lower back issues come here and it's like well I got a runny nose it's like nope lower back only you coming right here right so you I'm like last night at Camp y'all know like I'm standing there they've given 27 altar calls and I'm like man it's getting prettyy late I don't know if they're going to give an alter call for me right I'm like if they don't that's fine and then finally I remember the guest speaker he gets up and he says this next altar call I'm going to ask people to come down who feel called to full-time vocational Ministry in a local church you're called to be a pastor called to be a missionary called to preach the gospel you are called to serve the local church vocationally and I was like boom something just leaped inside of me I was like that's you boo boo so I was like no hesitation I ran to the front was like yes this altar call is for me so I ran down to the front I closed my eyes I lifted my hands I prayed in the guest speaker he prayed and I remember he said amen and I opened my eyes and I turn around and look y'all there were four to 500 students at this camp this week I was the only one that went down for this altar call so it's like you imagine I open my eyes and I look around I'm like where everybody at though you know what I'm saying and I remember coming back to the altar call like whoa like that feeling of excitement of like yeah this is what I'm called to do and I remember my best friend was standing next to me he goes bro you were the only one that went down there and I was like no really I saw like six I was like yes obviously I was the only one down there you Heathen what were you doing back there I'm just kidding I didn't say that to him but I remember the excitement I remember wrestling with attention God why did you put me on this Earth but then the moment where I discovered my purpose and then immediately began taking steps and putting the work in to see the dream become a reality you see what is my purpose that is an age-old question most people have grappled with at some point in their lifetime and maybe still are to this day see the a simple definition for the word purpose is the reason that something is done or created the reason so many of us wrestle with this question is because having purpose in life is one of the most fundamental human needs see people look for purpose in relationships careers accomplishments status and any other Earthly Pursuit that you can think of yet scripture reminds us that the only purpose that stands is the purpose of the Lord in Proverbs 19:21 one of my favorite verses it says this many are the plans in the mind of a man but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand see the plans of people are fleeting but the the purpose of God is forever the purpose of God is eternal in Proverbs 16:4 it says the Lord has made everything for its purpose lean over at your neighbor and say everything everything everything for its purpose that means God created you on purpose and for a purpose you are breathing sitting here today in your seat because there is purpose on the inside of you and one of the key factors to prepare us for our god-given purpose is found in scripture when we read and study the life of David which is what we have done in the series and more has been written about David than any other person in the Old Testament and you know at least I'll speak for me personally it's tempting and very easy to make the mistake of reading accounts about David's life with an easy filter when in reality David was able to achieve great things and walk in his god-given purpose because of his commitment to work hard Jonathan sack once said no great achiever even those who made it seem easy ever succeeded without hard work see when we read about David working as a Shepherd in the field or or about him killing The Lion and the bear to defend the sheep or we we read about David defeating Goliath and all his victories and battle as a warrior or when we read about him working in the palace for King Saul and then ultimately becoming King we can we can make the mistake of wrongly assuming that all of his accomplishments were easy simply because God was with him kind of reminds me like I've grown up Indiana born and raised and if you've heard me preach or you know me really well I I'm diard like y'all when the 12:30 service is over peace out go Pacers I'm going home to watch game s before our youth leader meeting this afternoon like that's why I'm saying Pacers and Racers right so I I'm die hard right and one of the the best privileges I've had growing up in Indiana was being alive at the right time to watch P Manning play football and what I love about PT Manning yo he's got statue for a reason you know what I'm saying what I love about P Manning is that whether I got to watch him in person or watch him on the TV it didn't matter who they were playing or what the circumstances were he was just good and he made it look easy I'm like he's the goat he's the greatest and it was easy to to watch him on TV or to watch him in the game even if the other team was better than us and and we were probably going to lose it was always going to be close because number 18 would keep us in the game he just made it look easy and as I got older I began to think about the stuff we didn't get to see on TV what he wasn't doing on Sundays to prepare for Sundays The Blood The Sweat s the tears the sacrifice the studying the game the the game tape and and the Playbook all the things that he didn't do he made it look easy but in reality it wasn't and you see we can honestly if we're not careful do the same thing when we study the life of David he made it look easy but it wasn't see David had a responsibility to do his part what we need to understand is that when it comes to fulfilling our purpose God will never do our part he only going to do his you see if we obey God and do what we know to do he will do his part David he did his part he worked hard and as a result he walked in his god-given purpose and today I want to talk to you about three keys to work hard to fulfill your purpose that I believe David bottled for us in scripture and the first one is this number one work hard right where you are with what you have see if you know anything about David he was the youngest son of Jesse he worked in the field as a shepherd and shepherding was a hard work I remember uh when I was in Bible College and I I had to do I wrote a sermon about David and what the professor required us to do was study like everything we possibly could about the character and then about that story in the text so I got to learn a lot about David and what he did as a Shepherd you see shepherding it required a great amount of walking to guide sheep to find Green Pastures and pockets of water among a desert land and shepherding also required David to guard his flock from many dangers including attacks from wild animals in fact when we read first Samuel 17 veres 34-35 David he recounts protecting his sheep here's what the Bible says your servant has been keeping his father's sheep when a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock I went after it struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth and when it turned on me I seized it by its tear Struck it and killed it y'all David was a bad dude you see whether he was guiding his flock or he was guarding his flock he worked hard and he gave it his best and what I love about David is that while he was a Shepherd there was no task that was beneath him as he prepared for his purpose and it's in the little things we prove ourselves being capable of bigger things because how we do the little things ultimately determines how we'll do the big things how you live your life on a daily basis matters going to bed at a decent time waking up on time putting the right food and drink in your body treating others well how you handle things at home it it matters keeping your space clean paying your bills on time creating a a an environment of peace and a health a healthy home how you work on your job it matters showing up on time doing what's asked of you no matter how small it seems meeting deadlines and then following directions that are given having a good attitude working hard with excellence and integrity how you stored yourself at school students it it matters doing the little things well studying doing homework listening to teachers because if you do the little things well then you'll do the big things well too you see while David was Faithfully tending to his flock that was when God chose him and appointed him to be king see no doubt being appointed King was a big significant accomplishment and yet David didn't get puffed up he wasn't prideful he wasn't arrogant he wasn't all about himself instead he went back the Bible says he went back to the field and did as he did before he was appointed King he was tended to his father's sheep you see how David did the little things well was how he would eventually do the big things throughout his life he modeled the value of hard work in the shepherd field the battlefield and then ultimately in the palace and I believe that like David we need to work hard right where we are today I think about the opportunities God has given me throughout my life to do the little things well so that one day I could ultimately do bigger things well I remember answering the call to a full-time Ministry graduating high school and I did all four years of college online and so I stayed at home and I I worked for our family business and then I I was going to get my degree and the youth pastor came to me and asked me to be a part of an internship to basically just lead uh this incredible youth ministry with him and at the time I didn't really I was not interested in youth ministry at all which probably makes parents scared that like our youth pastor at one point in time was not interested in youth ministry at all y' I love youth ministry okay uh but back then I was like nope that's not about me I was kind of like I've got nothing else better to do and I kind of went in it just carelessly and then over time as I began to to do realizing I was doing what God had purposed me to do my desires begin to change I be to work really really hard if the youth pastor asked me to vacuum the youth room or scrub the toilets or set up the curtains or like throw pool noodles in it like what this is stuff you do in youth ministry right I did all those little things to the best of my ability not realizing that God God was using that entire experience one day to prepare me to lead a youth ministry of my own because in September of 2020 we launched our youth ministry here in at the Indianapolis campus during the peak of covid and I look back and say God I'm thankful that I handled the little things well because I had no idea that I would get something bigger and ultimately how you handle the little things will determine how you do the big things we need to honor God with our lives and what we say what we do we have a choice to do the little things well every single day and when we work hard to do the little things well God can trust us with bigger things I believe what we should never question is if God really desires to give us bigger things I believe he does a better question is can God trust you to give you bigger things David worked hard where he was and he worked hard with what he had to accomplish God's purpose for his life and then number two like David we can also so work hard and overcome excuses you see excuses destroy success every time but as the famous artist Pablo Picasso once said action is the fundamental key to all success and what I love about David is that David was a man of action think about it this way when he could have made excuses to be in the house with his brothers instead of out with the Sheep he took action he didn't complain about the weather he didn't complain about how the Sheep smelled or like this one has ran away eight times today and I have to go back to get it at night time he didn't Grumble he didn't complain he took action think about when the lion and the bear attacked he didn't make excuses and I don't know about you but that'd probably be a good time to have a valid excuse is when a Lon or a bear comes like sorry Dad I thought my life was more important than the Sheep right he didn't even wait for his brothers to show up he didn't wait for his dad to come and help y'all he didn't even pray for God just to make the line in the bear go away he took action when trained Soldiers made excuses not to fight Goliath on the battlefield that day David didn't join in and make excuses think about this way King Saul gave David and out he's like listen all these guys are trained Warriors from Youth and they don't even want to fight this guy you're off the hook but David didn't take the out he took action he took action you see David didn't make excuses instead he made it happen people don't live out their god-given purpose making excuses they take action and they work hard George Washington Carver once said 99% of failures come from people who have the habit of making excuses Charles Spurgeon once said lazy people always find fault with their tools and those who do not intend to work always find some excuse I believe as people it's our natural tendency as human beings to come up with excuses but Proverbs 26:13 says a sluggard says there's a lion in the road a fierce lion roaming the streets you see King Solomon he wrote this proverb to illustrate the excuses that lazy people will make to avoid working hard so think about it this way a lazy person can always think of an excuse to avoid hard work but the reasoning for doing so is as foolish as claiming that there was a lion keeping them from their work and being a full-time Ministry at People's Church has taught me so much about life about Ministry and about myself when I first came on staff three years ago or I've been a part of people search for five years now I quickly learned a problem I personally had and that problem was I had a tendency to make excuses and as I began to dive deeper into that issue I realized it went all the way back to even when I was a kid I remember being in High School playing on our basketball team I always had an excuse for why our team didn't win enough games why I didn't get enough playing time why I didn't execute the way I wanted to on the court and y'all like I can't testify that I was always the good teammate the good leader the good player the good Christian that took responsibility and owned it either cuz it was everybody else's fault if we're being honest y'all I blame the coaches I blame my teammates I I blame the athletic director I man I was blaming everybody's grandma and their neighbor dog like for real I was not the problem I had excuses even as a student like I knew that I I told myself I was not capable of making Straight A's because I was not the most intellectual or academically gifted person in my class or in my family so I even settled for just making B's and C's or whatever just kind of coasting through a lot of school and then thankfully when I got older I realized that I need to take responsibility and I need to take action instead of making excuses and when I got into college I begin to put the work and I begin to invest more time and more energy and make the grades that I wanted to see because I realized that I wasn't experiencing the success I wanted because I was letting excuses hold Hold Me Back even in Ministry y'all I used to make so many excuses why we weren't seeing the growth or the results we wanted I could man I was probably blame again blaming everybody I was blaming leaders I was blaming volunteers students parents families everybody else was the problem not me then quickly realizing as a leader it's my responsibility God has trusted me to Steward my resources my opportunities my gifts my strengths my abilities I quickly learned you can take responsibility and you can take action you can make excuses or you can make a difference but you cannot do both I love what Psalm 128:2 and the message says says you worked hard and deserve all you've got coming enjoy the blessing come on lean over at your neighbor and say Enjoy the blessing enjoy the blessing soak in in the goodness see David he experienced the goodness of God as he worked hard and overcame excuses and I believe when we stop making excuses we finally get to soak in the goodness of God that comes from him honoring our hard work and our diligence work hard enjoy the blessings and soak in the goodness and then lastly number three like David we can work hard for God and not for people work hard for God not for people when we look throughout scripture and study it we find that David was a man who sought the Lord he listened to God and he responded with obedience and then 1st Samuel 23:2 it says that he inquired of the Lord saying shallal lie go and attack these Philistines the Lord answered him go attack the Philistines and save Kela notice he first didn't seek the advice of people in fact this year I I did a study all through the book of 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel and one phrase that I kept seeing repeated over and over and over again as I studied these two books was and David inquired of the Lord he didn't go to his generals his commanding officers he didn't go to the governors and officials says he went and inquired of the Lord David asked the Lord what should I do what do I need to do in 1st Samuel 17 here's another example David took food to his older brothers when they were battling against the Philistines and when David arrived he discovered all the soldiers were hiding in their tents out of fear of Facing the Giant and when David heard everyone was afraid to fight Goliath he chose Faith over fear and he declared I'll fight the giant I'll take Goliath on you see if David would have had followed the advice of his brothers and the other soldiers that day he would have fled the battlefield after his brothers told him leave he wouldn't have fought Goliath and if he would have never fought Goliath he wouldn't have defeated Goliath and saved Israel that day in the same chapter King Saul he tried to put his armor on David to prepare him for battle but it was too big because David was much younger than Saul the Bible says that s King Saul was significantly taller than everybody else in Israel so the armor didn't fit I imagine it probably looked like when a toddler a small child tries to wear their par t-shirt or their clothes I want you to just imagine for a moment David trying to fight and defeat Goliath wearing an armor that didn't fit him so that means it would have weighed his body down it would have obstructed his view because the armor was meant for someone else if David had followed the advice of King Saul he would have worn an armored that was not fit for battle but David knew that Saul's armor was not for him oh I bet you it looked nice it was probably Gucci or it was name brand it was something it cost a lot of money it was the Kings for crying out loud but David had enough awareness and confidence to say this isn't for me people search you cannot fulfill your god-given purpose trying to we somebody else's armor you cannot fulfill God's purpose for your life trying to be like somebody else I remember there was the time when I first started preaching as a teenager and to this day there are Dynamic preachers and communicators of the Gospel that I admire and look up to in so many different ways but I remember being younger I had an unhealthy admiration for some of these great men and women of God that I would try to not even just mimic their preaching but mimic mimic their personality and just the way they they lived their life and carried themselves like I try to there was one this one preacher in particular I try to dress like him like from the shoes all the way to the shirt I remember I try to talk like him shout like him preach like him y'all no lie I one time went to the barber shop and I showed my barber a picture of the student was like can you make my haircut look like this dude's haircut and I'm thankful that there were men and women of God in my life that spoke into to me and said Andrew you are trying to wear somebody else's armor that was not designed for you you have a voice you have an anointing you have a purpose wear what God has designed for you you see I kept trying to duplicate their personality their purpose and their Ministry but none of it was for me no matter how hard I tried I was getting confused and and frustrated because I couldn't accomplish my purpose wearing somebody else's armor because it didn't fit I was in a different season of life I had a different gift a different calling God had chosen something different for me and I believe there's so many of us who are trying to find our purpose today or we're trying to work to fulfill it you're fighting battle after battle you're doing everything you know how to do and it feels like things are just getting worse you're more confused you're more frustrated you're spinning your wheels and you're not gaining any traction you're not making progress and can I just submit to you today in the most loving way that I know how maybe it's time for you to take off somebody else's armor God uniquely created you for your purpose not your neighbor's purpose not your dad and mom's purpose not your best friend's purpose not the famous influencer that you follow on social media's purpose listen it takes hard work to live your life to please God in the become comfortable with the gifts he's given you and the purpose that he has placed on your life and it took hard work for me to learn how to stand firm and stay focused on my per on my purpose that God had for me and even now y'all I still get tempted looking at what other people are doing how they lead how they do ministry how they carry themselves and I get tempted to put on somebody else's armor but when I do I've learned to quiet myself before the Lord and refocus my heart and I remember for this God's purpose for me is for me it's not for anybody else God's purpose for me is for me and people search you can have confidence today that God's purpose for you is for you it can't be duplicated it can't be stolen it cannot be taken from you it can't be borrowed but you got to work hard where you are with what you have you can over overcome excuses and take action and you can work hard for God knowing that he is with you God's purpose for you is for you one last verse and we'll pray 1st Samuel 18:14 it says this about David and everything he did he had great success because the Lord was with him I don't know about you but I want that to be the testimony in my life everything I did I had great success not CU I was talented did not cuz I could move a crowd but because the Lord was with me people search the Lord is with you today work hard choose to work hard for God Walk in your god-given purpose because God's purpose for you is for you
kSfLQ_JxgC8,well today we're continuing our series called good God everybody say good God good God the title of my message today is never forget never forget Psalm 34 Verse 8 is our theme verse for this series it says taste and see that the Lord is good the series good God is all about how that even when life is hard God is good and unfortunately the enemy has gotten people to believe the lie he's gotten people to believe that God isn't good that when we look around at life and our challenges in our own life or in our own world or even around the world all the mess we see we can start to wonder is God really good and this whole series is to remind you that he is good and he invites every one of us to taste and see that God has a table filled with goodness filled with goodness but whether we experience that goodness is up to us we have to taste and see and so the first week of this series we talked about why don't people experience the goodness of God one of the reasons is they have the wrong perspective on their trials trouble trauma and Temptation we looked in James chapter one and realized those things don't make God bad no God is good matter of fact God in his goodness he'll take your trial your trouble and your trauma and he'll use it to make you stronger he'll use it to make you better he'll use it to help turn things around in your life we learn the Temptation it does not come from God God does not tempt us he is a good god full of goodness matter of fact he's so good that when we are tempted God always makes a way out to get away for the Temptation and then last week we talked about one another reason why people don't experience and taste the goodness of God is because they don't step out in faith you have to taste and see there's a part we have to play God is not going to force us to experience his goodness we have to step out in faith to experience the goodness of God and so people miss out and don't experience that because they don't step out in faith they don't do their part to experience it and God doesn't Force us to experience his goodness we have to take steps of faith and be obedient to God's word to experience his goodness in our life and so if you missed either one of those messages please go to our YouTube Page search People's Church Indianapolis and you can watch those messages well today I want to talk about a third reason we don't taste and see the goodness of God I wonder if any of you have ever had a family member get amnesia where they can't remember things or people uh or or names I know it was very difficult for me and my dad when we went to go visit my Bop sheep she was starting to have dementia and when she wouldn't remember who we are and we'd have to remind her and if you've experienced that a family member or friend dealing with memory loss it's really hard on families on individuals and Amnesia in general terms describes loss of memories such as facts information and experience the loss can be temporary or permanent but Amnesia usually refers to the temporary loss of memory it can be triggered by several things stroke brain inflammation reaction to cancer Alzheimer's certain viruses head and brain injuries certain drugs alcohol traumatic events Amnesia can be very difficult on people and families but what's even worse than physical amnesia is spiritual Amnesia when people forget about the goodness of God some people aren't experience the goodness of God because they have forgotten about the goodness of God and this is a huge issue for many Christians they have forgotten about the goodness of God the Bible says in Psalm 103 verse 2 praise the Lord my soul and forget not all his benefits why does the bible tell us to not forget God's blessings to not forget his benefits is because Christians tend to develop spiritual amnesia where they forget about the goodness of God Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 12 it says be careful that you do not forget the Lord who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery the Bible says don't forget who brought you out don't forget who saved you who delivered you who has provided for you who has blessed you don't develop spiritual amnesia today I want to give you five consequences of spiritual Amnesia the first consequence is this we stop obeying God's commands and laws Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 11 we're going to be in the Old Testament most of today looking at God's people the people of Israel and how they forgot how they had spiritual Amnesia and Deuteronomy 8 11 it says be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God failing to observe his commands his laws and his decrees that I'm giving you this day when you forget how good God has been to you it leads to disobeying God's Commandments and laws you start living however you want to live you start doing whatever you want to do you know what God's word says to do but you don't obey it can I ask you are you disobeying God's word spiritual Amnesia always leads to Disobedience number two is we become proud going on in Deuteronomy 8 verse 12-14 it says otherwise when you eat and are satisfied when you build fine houses and settle down and when your herds and flocks grow large and you're silver and gold increase all you have is Multiplied then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery spiritual Amnesia leads to Pride when you forget that every good and perfect gift comes from God above you start thinking you're the one who got yourself the job you're the one who got yourself the degree the money the house the car the life you have now you start believing I did this I blessed myself spiritual amnesia always leads to Pride and pride leads to point three the third consequence is we become ungrateful when you forget that God is the one who gave you everything that you have you become ungrateful you stop praising and thanking God for all that he has done and continues to do for you see ungrateful people become entitled I deserve what I have and I don't have enough and whenever you become ungrateful it leads to point four number four we become complainers the Israelites forgot that it was God who delivered them from the slavery of Egypt it was God who parted that Red Sea and allowed them to walk through the sea on dry land it was God Who provided them from the desert come on God is the one that rained down those banana milk shakes and then banana patties and peanut butter and banana sandwiches God was the one that rained down that Manna and fed them every day he provided the water from the rock so that they could drink God was the one who sustained them but they forgot and started complaining First Corinthians 10 10 it says and do not Grumble as some of them did and were killed by the destroying Angel see when we forget God's goodness we're always complaining we become negative we start talking about all the things that we don't have nobody understands I don't know why I don't have that my job stinks my kids are horrible school is horrific I hate my marriage my friends are stupid complaining is a sign that you have spiritual amnesia Philippians 2 14 it says do everything without grumbling or arguing but when you have spiritual Amnesia you do everything while complaining and then the fifth consequence of spiritual Amnesia is we worship idols when Israel was in the desert complaining and whining it led to worshiping Idols see spiritual Amnesia can lead to you worshiping other things instead of the Living God Of Heaven and Earth look at Exodus chapter 32 verse 3 and 4. it says so all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron he took what they had handed him and he made it into an idol cast into a shape of a calf fashioning it with a tool then they said these are your Gods Israel who brought you out of Egypt wow they forgot about the goodness of God and started worshiping earrings man they started worshiping their possessions they started to make their stuff their God it's easy to start making your stuff your God people start neglecting God church prayer Bible reading and worship and they start giving all their time and attention to making more money accumulating more possessions and neglecting God for family I've seen people worship their kids worship their family worship a relationship worship their possessions they put other things or people before God the consequences of spiritual Amnesia they are dangerous and so today I want to now give you the cure for Spiritual Amnesia the cure for Spiritual Amnesia first is this is you have to acknowledge the goodness of God acknowledge the goodness of God look at James 1 17. every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of the Heavenly lights who does not change like shifting Shadows you need to believe and constantly say every good and perfect gift comes from God above you need to say every blessing I have comes from God come on acknowledge God in all your ways God you gave me the talent God you gave me my brain God you gave me my ideas and abilities and work ethic God you gave me my health my job my money my home my cars God you gave me my kids my spouse my church family every blessing is from you it's a cure for Spiritual Amnesia we got to acknowledge the goodness of God number two make a memorial so you remember the goodness of God make a memorial so you remember the goodness of God Psalm 77 11 I will remember the Deeds of the Lord yes I will remember your miracles of long ago you need to remember the Deeds the Miracles the goodness of God Deuteronomy 8 18 it says but remember the Lord your God for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth and so confirms his Covenant which he swore to your ancestors as it is today one of the ways that we can remember the goodness of God Is by setting up a memorial let me show you how Israel did this look at Joshua chapter 4 verse 21-23 it says then Joshua said to the Israelites in the future your children will ask what do these Stones mean there was a pile of stones he says then you can tell them this is where the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry ground for the Lord your Gods right up the river right before your eyes and he kept it dry until you were all across just as he did at the Red Sea when he dried it up until we had all crossed over you need to set up some stones in your life so you never forget what God has done for you maybe start a journal and write down how God has blessed your life maybe take pictures of your blessings and scroll through the pictures every week and remember the goodness of God maybe on the notes section on your phone you need to have a note that says never forget and write down 12 things you can never forget and review the list weekly if we all spend some time thinking about it I believe we all have 12 Stones 12 things we can remember that God did I know I have 12. God saved me in a youth service in 1999. number two god Set Me Free from addiction number three God helped me overcome anxiety number four God filled me with the Holy Spirit number five God gave me my incredible wife Jamie number six God gave me my three amazing kids number seven God gave me an opportunity to come back home to any Indianapolis and Planet Church number eight God gave me a wonderful church family in people's Church number nine God gave me some incredible friends number 10 God gave me an awesome staff number 11 God uses me to preach the gospel number 12 God allows me to be a part of seeing more changed lives I'm telling you right every single one of us we got some it's God it's God only every good and perfect gift it's from God Alone we got to set up a memorial so that we never get amnesia so we never forget what God has done matter of fact if you remember what God has done it gives you Hope and Faith for what God is going to do in the future and so we gotta we gotta remember number three thank God daily for his goodness Psalm 9 11 I will give thanks to you Lord with all my heart and I will tell of all your wonderful Deeds spend time every day thanking God for his blessings don't be ungrateful don't be entitled thank God daily first Thessalonians 5 18 it says give thanks in all everybody say all give thanks in all circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus thank you Jesus for blessing me thank you God for being so so good to me I remember shortly after I was saved we were attending I think there another church they were having a special church service and I remember this worship Pastor he started singing this song it says when I think about his goodness and what he's done for me when I think about his goodness and how he set me free he makes me dance dance dance dance dance oh Brother start I wish I could dance y'all I'd do a little Cabbage Patch for Jesus in my house every morning when I think about his goodness and what he's done for me when I think about his goodness and how he set me free I'm gonna dance dance whatever it is come on can we take 10 seconds right now and praise God and thank him for his goodness you can

God come on daily daily daily give God thank him for his God really wish I could dance y'all I'm just telling you I really wish I could but I'll do my dance for my the Lord in the private and number four tell others about the goodness of God tell others a cure for Spiritual amnesia Deuteronomy 4 9 it says only be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live teach them to your children and to their children after them see instead of spending your time complaining to others spend your time testifying about the goodness of God come on tell your children how good God has been to you it will change your children if you will stop complaining and start thanking God when you drive home from church today just take a few minutes and tell them about how good God has been to you tell your spouse about the goodness of God it will change your marriage if you stop all the complaining and whining it will change the atmosphere in your home if you will stop complaining and start being thankful tell people at your work and school about the goodness of God it will change your work and school environment if you start being thankful tell your friends about the goodness of God it will change your friendships if every day you talked about the goodness of all and most of all it will change you if every day you start talking about the goodness of God listen everybody has challenges trouble problems and difficult times in life but the people who don't get spiritual Amnesia are the ones who tell others about the goodness of God and then number five never stop celebrating the goodness of God come on look at your neighbor and tell them never stop never stop never stop celebrating the goodness of God you need to daily celebrate and praise God for his goodness in your life Psalm 92 4 it says for you make me glad by your Deeds Lord I sing for Joy at what your hands have done

vjOoZf2bQ0M,and well today we're continuing our series called Miracles I've titled my message today this is why you're not receiving your Miracle how many know kids are always asking their parents questions or kids are always asking for something if you have a child you know ex exactly what I'm talking about they're always asking questions matter of fact my youngest his name's Co he is 5 years old y'all I don't know how he is full of so many questions I don't understand how morning noon and night that brother has a question he always has questions and M matter of fact one of his one of his questions is Dad why did God make mosquitoes Co that's a good question and if somebody got the answer share with me after service I said Coen you're going to have to wait till you get to heaven you're going to have to ask God about those mosquitoes Cohen does not like mosquitoes y'all I kid you not every night when we have prayers with Cohen he has one prayer he goes to the throne of God and he asks God every night to get rid of all the mosquitoes on the earth and so I'm just telling you if there's a day where mosquitoes go extinct you can thank my 5-year-old because he's been calling on the name of the Lord why did God make mosquitoes uh last week we were in the car and we were going to Culver's for a little family date and we were driving and and Cohen sing is about how he's always talking about how he's jacked Dad I'm jacked he's like Dad look how many look how many push I can do 40 push-ups and so we're in the car and he said dad do you know how to do a push down I said Coen you mean a pushup he said Dad I know what a pushup is a push down I was like whoa I said man Coen I'm no I I don't know what a push down is you want me to show you I said yes why when we get to Culver and so y'all we pulled up in the Culver he gets up out of the car he's like Dad let me show you what a push down is I'm going show youall what a push down is so now you can add this into your workout repertoire all right but nojo he gets in the The Crab position you know what I'm saying the crab position He says Dad this is a push down he was working it y'all oh he was getting them triceps pumped up I said Cohen I never knew that was a push down kids love asking questions do I have to eat my vegetables yes why they're healthy for your body why are they healthy for my body because they have vitamins what are vitamins why do I need vitamins do chocolate chips have vitamins stop with the question G every time we get in the car Cohen always asking can we get Starbucks we've created a monster a mom said her daughter asked why do you wear makeup the mom says it helps me look less tired the daughter said are you done she said yes the daughter said maybe you need more you still look really really tired kids be asking questions you know what I've learned is that the older people get it seems like they lose their willingness to ask and that's what I want to talk about today we grow up we become adults and lose our asking last week we kicked off this miracle series nothing is too hard from God and we learned that there's only one common denominator you need to receive a miracle that there's over 160 miracles in the Bible and there's only one one common denominator to receive a miracle the one thing you need is a need if you have a need you're a candidate for a miracle your need attracts the power of God and if you have a need here's the second thing you need to receive a miracle you need to ask you need to ask James 4:2 it says you desire but you do not have so you kill you covet but you cannot get what you want so you quarrel and fight and here it is he says you do not have because you do not ask God there are many people who haven't experienced a miracle a healing a breakthrough not because God is not willing or able but because they haven't asked one of life's greatest tragedies are not the prayers that go unanswered but the prayers that go unasked and many of you you're wondering why you're not seeing God meet your need he give you your breakthrough Miracle or healing you have not because you ask not you have to ask God and so got me thinking why don't people ask God I want to give you five reasons five reasons we don't ask God the first is because God already knows my needs some people don't ask because they think they don't think it's necessary God already knows what I need so he'll meet my need if he wants to and it's very true that God knows what you need before you ask him Matthew 68 Jesus saido not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him God knows what you need before you ask him but you have to ask God because your asking it is an invitation for God to do a work in your life you're asking it also it changes your outlook before it ever changes your outcome because when you ask God all of a sudden your attention shifts from you to God when you ask God you're acknowledging your dependence on God you're inviting God into your situation you're saying I can't do I need you God I'm placing my trust in you I'm inviting you to do what only you can do in my life and situation asking shifts our outlook before it changes our outcome John 16:24 Jesus said until now you have not asked for anything in my name ask and you will receive re and your joy will be complete ask and then you will receive ask and you will receive you're asking it's an invitation for God to come and move in your life in your heart and in your mind here's another reason you don't believe God will help you some of you aren't asking because you doubt that God wants to work in your life you believe God still does Miracles but you doubt that God wants to do a miracle for you you don't ask because of unbelief and unbelief can hinder you from receiving a miracle look at Mark 6 verse 5-6 Mark says and because of their unbelief he couldn't do any Miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them look at verse six and it says and he was amazed at their unbelief Jesus was amazed at their unbelief your unbelief is stopping you from asking God and you're missing your Miracle listen I believe this series your unbelief is going to decrease and your belief in God it's going to increase more and more and more every single week throughout this series let me give you another reason we don't ask number three is pride for some of you pride is stopping you from asking your self-sufficiency is robbing you of a miracle look at 2 Chronicles 16:12 and 13 it says in the 39th year of his Reign ASA was afflicted with a disease in his feet though his disease was severe even in his illness he did not ask help from the Lord but only from the Physicians ASA once served God but he became so prideful he wouldn't take his severe sickness to the Lord he was going to Physicians but not to God let me say this I'm all for going to the doctor myself my family we go to the doctor we take medicine when needed I believe God uses doctors and medicine to be a blessing for your life Ace's issue wasn't that he went to doctors it was the fact that he allowed his pride to keep him from asking God for help do you find yourself going to everybody with your problem except God are you trying to be self-sufficient and make it without God is your pride keeping you from asking God for your help let me give you the fourth reason unworthy feelings some of you aren't asking God to give you a miracle because you feel unworthy you know your sin your mistakes your weaknesses and you struggle with feelings of guilt and unworthiness I want you to listen to this verse Hebrews 4:1 15-16 it says the high priest of our stands our weaknesses for he faced all the same testings we do yet he did not sin so let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God there we will receive his mercy and he will find Grace to help us when we need it most listen Jesus under he understands all your weaknesses all your testings all your Temptations because he faced all of the testing and The Temptations but he never sinned Jesus understands what you're going through he understands your weaknesses and yet it says come boldly listen Church go to God ask him for forgiveness to forgive you of your sins and shortcomings he's a forgiving God he's a merciful god he's a gracious God there's no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus and then approach God's throne of grace boldly because he loves to answer your prayers stop allowing your feelings of Shame and unworthiness to keep you from asking God to meet your needs stop hanging your head and start lifting your ask lift your ask number five the fifth reason is Disappointment some of you have stopped asking God because of disappointment it can be disappointment or disappointing when you've been praying for something and you haven't seen any sign of God at work in your situation some of you have prayed about a situation and it got worse that can be discouraging some of you have prayed about a situation for years and nothing has happened and you became discouraged disappointed and you stopped praying you're wondering if God ever heard your prayers let me remind you of what Jesus said in Luke 18:1 then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up Jesus told us always pray and never give up always pray and never give up just because the answer has been delayed does not mean it's been denied you have to keep praying our one job is we pray and never give up God's job is to answer the prayers all he wants us to do is our job always pray never give up you keep doing your job and allow God leave God's job up to him no matter how long you've been waiting and praying and waiting and praying never give up never stop praying never stop asking God you may be thinking why here's why asking is biblical it's biblical you may feel Pastor I just I don't feel right but asking God to help me Heal Me provide for me to meet this need in my life I grew up in a house where we didn't ask for things I feel like I'm being selfish I just don't feel right about it hear me if you don't ask God you're actually disobeying God because asking is biblical ma mark 11:24 Jesus said therefore I tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you've received it and it will be yours you ask then you receive Matthew 21:22 if you believe you'll receive whatever you ask for in prayer notice it doesn't say whatever you think whatever you process whatever you wonder about whatever you stress about no no no no it says you will receive whatever you ask asking is biblical if you haven't received it yet yet you need to keep asking Matthew 7:11 if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him you ask and then you receive Matthew 9:38 it says ask the lord of the Harvest therefore to send out workers into the Harvest field listen if you want to see Revival a Great Awakening in Indianapolis and in our state and in our nation and in our world we have to ask God to send out workers into the Harvest field complaining won't cause a revival going on social media and talking bad about wickedness and even in our world that will not cause an outpouring of the Holy Spirit we have to ask we have to pray pray for more Christians to share their faith at work and at school pray for your lost son and daughter and family member and friend and coworker to be saved pray that the people you're inv writing to the kids carnival yes week that they say yes and pray that their lives will be changed asking is biblical Matthew 18:19 again I truly tell you that if two of you on Earth agree about anything they ask for it will be done for them by my Father in Heaven it says not think not process not anything that two or three they Wonder or stress about but ask the greatest tragedy in life are the are not the prayers that go unanswered or excuse me the greatest tragedy in life are the prayers that go unanswered because they go unasked you have to ask asking is biblical Matthew 7: 738 Jesus said ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you for everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks finds and the one who knocks the door will be open this verse is literally telling us to ask and to keep on asking if you haven't received your answer Jesus says keep on asking keep on praying don't stop don't quit don't give up asking is biblical now listen next you have to ask with the right motives ask with the right motives James 4:3 through for it says when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures you adulterous people don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God James is saying before we ask we need to check our motives because wrong motives will hinder us from receiving from God some of your prayers aren't being pray aren't being answered because you have wrong motives let me share with you two wrong motives the first is when you're motivated by selfishness and worldliness James says people ask so they can spend what they get on themselves he's talking about praying with selfish motives he also says that friendship with the world means enmity against God he's talking about worldly motives you have to check your motives when you're asking God for something I I think most of us have the right motives when we're asking God to to to for healing in our body mind and emotions but when you ask God to give your enemies hemorrhoids gout and Lord I pray all their teeth Fallout wrong motives wrong motives when you're asking God for material possessions so you can impress people compete with people wrong motives check your motives when you're asking God here's a second wrong m is when you're motivated by your will James is really exposing the root of people's selfish and worldly motives people want their will not God's Will and hear me today God doesn't answer prayers that are outside of his will God does not answer prayers that are outside of his will so check your motives 1 John 514 this is the confidence we have in approaching God that if we ask anything according to his will everybody say his will that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us if you want your prayers heard and answered you have to pray prayers that are in alignment with God's will well Pastor how can I know God's will here it is read God's word God's word is is God's will God's word is God's will that's why it's so important that's why we're doing a four-week challenge so you can be in church every single week where you're going to hear the teaching and preaching of God's word where you're going to hear the the the word rightly divided this why you got to get in a small group with other Christians where you're going to talk to other people about the word of God because God's word is God's will the Bible says to live holy so pray ask God to deliver you from sin addiction and bondage God's word says that he wants you to have peace so ask God pray for peace in your mind and in your heart and in your relationship God wants everyone to be saved so pray and ask God for your lost friends and family to be saved God Is A Healer so ask God pray for healing for your body now listen some things in God's word we don't need to ask him because God's word tells us exactly what we are supposed to do we don't need to pray we need to obey let me give you an example God's word says to get water baptized after being saved after you're after you're saved you are to get water baptized you don't have to pray about get if you've given your life to Jesus you don't have to pray about getting water baptized he is not going to tell you no yeah I don't know brother you've been getting on my nerves a little lately I know what my word says but I think you need to hold off I don't think you ready for the water no God's word says after you're saved to be water baptized you don't have to pray about that he already said yes that's your next step some things you don't need to pray about you need to be obedient and then lastly ask with faith ask with faith when you ask God for a miracle ask in Faith having faith is key to receiving a miracle Hebrews 11:5 it says by faith Enoch was taken from this life so that he did not experience death he could not be found because God had taken him away for before he was taken he was commended as one who pleased God faith is key to experiencing the miraculous in Hebrews 11:11 it says and by faith even Sarah who was past child childbearing age was unable to Bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise Sarah got pregnant and had a baby by faith Hebrews 11:29 by faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land but when the Egyptians tried to do so they were drowned the Israelites saw the water parted by faith Matthew 9:10 it says some men brought to him Jesus a paralyzed man lying on a mat when Jesus saw their faith he said to the man take heart son your sins are forgiven Matthew 9:22 Jesus turned and saw her take heart daughter he said your faith has healed you and the woman was healed at the moment Jesus healed this woman with a blood issue because of her faith Matthew 9:29 then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith let it be done for you the blind received their sight Miracle by faith Matthew 15:28 then Jesus said to Heroman you have great faith your request is granted and her daughter was healed at the moment Mark 10:52 go said Jesus your faith has healed you immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road acts 14:9 he listened to Paul as he was speaking Paul looked directly at him saw that he had Faith to be healed having faith is key to receiving a miracle and you may saying pastor what is Faith do I have faith how do I get Faith can I grow my faith if so how I need a miracle how do I have faith next week I'm gonna talk about faith make sure you're here next Sunday be here we're going to talk about faith but today I want to review I want to review you have not because you ask not you don't receive a miracle because you don't ask God we can have these reasons well God already knows my needs or you don't believe God will help you Pride unworthy feeling disappointment listen all those things are hindering you from the work that God wants to do listen Asking is biblical God is waiting for us to to invite him into our situation he's waiting for us to ask oh he's sitting there 24/7 365 days of the year he never turns your prayers on snooze he's waiting waiting waiting for you to ask waiting for you to invite him in he is ready waiting asking is biblical and yet we got to ask with the right motives he will not answer a prayer that is not according to his will so we got to ask with the right motives and then ask with faith ask and believe ask and believe the greatest tragedy in life are the prayers that go unanswered because they go unas
-TyfIdDkIpM,"today is a special day because back with us again we have Gary bracket come on would y'all help welcome Gary bracket Indianapolis Colt Super Bowl champion welcome welcome welcome thank

I I just have to speak it out just speak it out yeah now you've had a lot of surgeries and throughout your career and and and whatnot why don't you to share with the how many have you had yeah so I had 10 surgeries wow throughout my throughout my life uh in the NFL I shared this earlier that I had this thing that you know jokingly I was like I wanted to play 10 years or I was going to stop at 10 surgeries um but I got to nine years and I had eight surgeries when I retired I had two since then so uh wasn't a goal I was looking looking to hit for sure you said it you hit it just yeah I was definitely uh managing my own expectations man but uh it's a part of it's a part of the job it's a part of that profession and uh I shared earlier that often times we want the dream without you know any of the difficulties yeah uh but you know sometimes there's some things that come along with our dreams our goals our aspirations and and for me that was just one of them yeah wow we'll pray for no more no more you hit 10 be done with it um Gary tell us a little bit about your childhood where did you grow up and when did you start playing football loving football realizing oh I'm actually good at this yeah it it was crazy I grew up in uh Camden New Jersey okay I don't know you guys familiar cden um is like our in New Jersey is like G Indiana sorry any was from Gary Indiana uh but you kind of know what that means um in fact Cen at one point they won a it wasn't an award but they got named number one like worst city in America oh wow and and they had t-shirts that said we are number one and on the back it said worst C in America so that's the area might as well Market it right yeah yeah man so um at 5 years old we moved uh into Glassboro our small suburban town down 20 minutes outside of cden of Philadelphia I grew up with uh three older brothers one younger sister um and we just always played Sports I mean it was football basketball baseball um but when we got involved in football I figured out like I could actually hit people and not get in trouble right there's something to this so uh so I kind of stuck with that right and um I was always aggressive kid I was you know the youngest boy so I kind of had to be aggressive uh I if I wanted to get anything in the house so um then I grew up just playing football loving it and I got when I got to high school um I play football and basketball um but yeah I just just fell in love with it okay were you always on defense so it's funny I ran the ball a little bit I was an offensive player okay um my my freshman year um scored like 20 something touchdowns okay uh so my sophomore year you know I'm thinking this is my 16y old self like I'm going to play JV and I'm going to score 20 some touchdowns and have a whole bunch of girls you know but um so what happened was though um Varsity I wasn't really expected to play Varsity I thought older class we're going to play but the first game of the year on Varsity uh the coach uh wanted to put me in in the first quarter the other linebacker was making some mistakes he just go out there for a play you know we used to run the play in from the sideline so I ran the play in called it um it was not a blitz however I thought it was a good idea I blit right so I blissed inside the Back Field made a tackle for lost um he kept me out there I me about three more tackles that series had about 15 tackles that game um so it was like yo you're you're a Defender for now on like fall in love with this there you go that was your calling yeah that was it that was awesome so coming uh you know playing linebacker now in high school assum you had some really strong Seasons your junior senior year what did it look like as far as College you know going to that next level were you getting offers or whatnot kind of how give give us that party your story yeah so I went to a small school um so it was about 500 kids that went there okay um 130 in my class and um I didn't realize you know shame on me that when the college show interest and sent letters that I was supposed to like mail them back so so I just had a shoe box fill of letters right thinking like some way like if you build it they would come um they did not come okay uh in fact my senior year my coach sent out my uh senior year playoff tap to get me recruited soit a little bit late in the recruitment process so um and then unfortunately if you just look at statistics well we were either involved in a good game or it was 28-0 halftime and I wasn't playing anymore so like my kind of stats suffered you know just because of that type of a lineup so I wasn't really on anyone's radar Ruckers came down uh they gave me ability to be what's it called like a a recruit walk on okay um so I walked on at Ruckers University and you know by the grace of God um my parents were able to figure figure it out we had to pay full tuition for two seasons but uh it was rough but they they figured it out so how did that what did that process look like so you you're in this program you're walking on when did you become scholarship how how did all that happen yeah so um crazy story so my third season now hting into I get a phone call from my father during training camp and he's like hey I got some bad news um the tuition bill came at this point I'm 18 19 years old I'm like all right pay it like like you know how many people when you're young you thought your parents had like money on trees somewhere somehow they always have money right so um he was like no it doesn't work that way um there's no more equity in our house I took out two line of credits I don't have any more Equity so you got to come home so at the time I told my position coach um that I I had to leave I wasn't on scholarship and he was surprised cuz I at this point I'm I'm on special teams I'm I'm I'm backup a linebacker um so he said I I'll talk to head coach no promises so I'm like okay so I filled my Hyundai XL uh hatchback you know with everything I own um I I say I got some biceps some residual effect because at 55 miles per hour the car shook right so I had to keep it straight um but I get called into the coach's office that day the head coach uh he walks in and uh he says hey man I just want to let you know that we're going to recruit players that are bigger and better than Gary bracket I'm just like ouch it's like your girlfriend breaks up with you and then she says I'm I'm a date a guy who's cuter got more money so so I'm just like yo I'm I'm good like thank you for the opportunity uh but he says um we just uh lost a player due to academics and um I I love your work e ethic I love what you stand for and we're going to give you a scholarship wow oh man so I get up right I'm crying I'm hugging him uncomfortably like you not going to forget this he's pushing me away um oh man and then U this moment uh changed my life I went into to the weight room the weight room is about this size in college football 100 guys lifting weights making a bunch of noise I told my three or four buddies like man I get a scholar sh I get to stay and I never forget there's a guy Wesley Robinson he walks up to me like hey what's going on um I was like I got a scholarship I get to say he was like scholarship you should worry about starting and I was like starting I'm like bro I I I like I I just had the meal plan where I could eat like every other day in school um I was I was a kid outside the mesle like oh you couldn't you give something to eat you got an extra swipe all right let's let's go eat then what we waiting on so um so that night though um when I went to sleep or tried to um that that that conversation just kept on repl playing in my he you should be the starter you should be the starter um so then I I sat down and I wrote out a list of things of what I need to do to become a starter wow so I had to work harder I had to be more diligent um I had to be more focused I had to give up some things right uh standing up late eating pizza right that $5 Pizza meals right it cost something more than $5 I can assure you that um but yeah so I I went in I I posted that that piece of paper on my bed so I could see it every morning every night before I went to bed and the next day I committed to that list I finished my Ruckers career um being a captain uh being a starter uh two-time MVP wow and now I'm in the Ruckers Hall of Fame because I made that commitment come on let's go that's awesome man I didn't know you were in the Ruckers Hall of Fame yeah that is really really cool well so obviously you finished really strong I mean what a story again not even scholarship two years but then you get scholarship and then the power of a word right that gentleman you'll you'll never forget him and what he spoke to you and but you obviously put in the work and so after that what what was the process to the NFL how didd you get there what was that Journey like yeah so the then the process to NFL was you know from a uh Ruckers you know wasn't the PowerHouse we are now right not not quite but um but we won five games my in my fouryear career so um you know we're we're almost The Laughing stop right um so uh at our pro day which most you know universities has all 32 teams represented we have four um so the Indianapolis coaches had to be one of those teams okay I worked out really good had some really solid numbers and um you know they say hey uh we're going to be in touch with you um no promises and second day of the draft I'm sitting out home and I get a call on the seventh round after I done talk bad about every lineb they got picked ahead of me um Gary was taking receipts y he was taking receipts I was like man um but yeah they said hey um there's opportunity if you don't get drafted that we're going to ass you as a free agent uh you can come out here here and make the team so I said man that's that's all I need is opportunity that's incredible do you remember what they said because again you only had four teams did they share with you like again Rucker only won five games so it's not like you know like you said you're not like one of the top teams getting look at you remember what they said to you just what they saw about you at that pro day or their time with you to go ahead and offer you that contract so the crazy thing that happened right is we had a tight end LJ Smith who played for the Eagles that was projected to be the first round okay so on Wednesday he's training and like tweets his hamstring on Thursday we get a letter that they're going to reschedule the event because everyone's coming to see him you guys won five games four years there can't be anybody else on this team um so on Friday we got a message that is back on okay so I guess a bunch of teams rescheduled didn't come but four teams okay came and you know a bunch of my buddies um Unfortunately they went out when they heard it was off and they couldn't quite recover you know quick enough and and I was there I was finishing every drill I I was working hard I was I wasn't stopping I had a motor I could comprehend stuff um even at the end of the workout um they asked me back to your question about running back they asked hey can you play your running back so they had me actually running some routes out the back field catching the ball they like hey are you versatile what can you do for us so um I had a really a really good you know event and they was like man I just love the way that you work out here wow that's incredible yeah that's incredible so the Colts call you they say hey we want to sign you now help because I don't understand all of it I you know I was you know I follow the Colts and I see they sign I think they have a number of undrafted people but not everybody makes it right so what what was that like for you you get signed you show up to Colts camp and uh and then you you obviously made the team but what was that Journey like yeah so it's um uh my my signing bonus right at the time was a whopping $2,000 okay right and in my mind I thought it was $2,000 so I'm spending half of that right before I got here they give my check it was 1,200 I'm like who's suda Fooda and all these rest of these people like I I ain't order that uh but um that's what it was so um I'm already in the hole when I got here um but I I was signing the contract you know we're all sitting there's about a hundred uh free agents and people that come on the team 53 end up making a roster another eight you know make the practice squad uh so it was highly competitive but when I'm signing my contract you know I never thought that I would be in Indianapolis Indiana right I thought it was a bunch of cornfield I didn't know what to expect but when I was but when I was signing my contract a little bit nervous just met paint Mana for the first time how you doing Mr Man sir nice to meet you um and you know you had to write down like what's your what team are you on in NFL and I'm on the Indianapolis Colts but I never spelled Indianapolis before so so I asked the guy like yo how do you spell Indianapolis he's like oh my God like how are you goingon to help us it was like it was the it was the eyes that got me in trouble right the ey in there a lot of eyes so um I end up I end up figuring it out um I made the team um and and in training camp it was just it I can remember remember this this play it was on uh the second day of training camp the first day I didn't get any experience I was fourth string uh the problem with for string NFL is that for string doesn't exist so I wasn't gonna I wasn't going to see any time so this was the opportunity it was uh kickoff return team was up and it was a scout team uh kickoff team so we just had to run down you put a beanie on your head and just run down give him a look um one of the veteran players was like oh man I got to run down down give myself up um you know we call a dummy car you do what what the car says um I was like I run down for you he was like for real I get a break I'm like yeah I ain't do nothing all day man I got that bean I said it is on they kicked the ball off man I flew down the field ran past my guy made the tackle the coach was like that on where' he come from I'm like hey right here 58 coach uh so the next play uh the gentleman um I want to say his name Darnell Thompson uh but he like hey 58 like calm down I hit him with the Mumbo like like strap up he like okay so the second time it happens again they kick the ball off he's strapped up he's coming full speed I'm running full speed um right before we make Collision um right before you you attack someone you know 40 yards apart you have to like trans from your weight from your heels to your toes okay CU if you're on your heels you're too flat somebody can run you over you got up on your toes you have has momentum so knowing that once you go on your toes you're susceptible to a move so he got on his toes last minute I swam across him he fell in his face I ran out made to play again they was like oh my God can anybody block him so the next day it was kickoff team and someone's name was scratched out and my name was written in wow that's awesome so I I say that to say that a lot of opportunities in life uh kind of show up as overall s and it looks like work right that's a word right there but it's not until we actually go through with it and do that work that actually actually get closer to what we actually want to achieve so did you hit a point where they were like you're you're on you're official you've made the team yeah so um my first uh NFL game was a preseason game in Chicago uh it was my second time ever in the NFL stadium okay um we we scal tickets when I was like a senior in high school uh $50 at the Eagle Stadium we had we had the last seat in the house like literally we were touching the ceiling so my second experience I'm at the game and they're like hey be ready for special teams in the second half uh first quarter one of the guys broke his hand um so they're on the sideline and the head co I mean the defensive coordinator was like all right who we're going to put in they drafted the linebacker at fifth round um and we're talking I was supposed to be third string he was like oh let's pagaran so they put me in the first quarter of my first preseason game and I was oh my God me so I'm stretching oh my God he said me so um nervous I go out there um but I've always had like leadership qualities it's something I was I was the youngest of of three boys so I had to speak up if I wanted to get something done so I would get in the Huddle and they were used to the Huddle being kind of wild you know they're doing what they want to do but I would I when I got in H I was like Hey eyes up everybody eyes on me I'm not calling a call to everybody quiet they're looking like who the heck is this kid talking to us like this but I call the calls based my voice uh made other correct adjustments aming plays and they was like oh man this this kid is all right so from there I kind of realized like yo I got a I got a shot that's awesome what are some of your favorite uh memories from the NFL oh man uh my favorite memory is is the second game after that Chicago game we played Seattle at home and they were calling out the defense and um when they call out the def they call every player individually when I was young I had a reoccurring dream of having my name getting CAU out of NFL tunnel wow right and and when that happened um now Indiapolis Coast number 58 from Ruckers carry bracket it was like the longest that anyone has ever tooken running out on the field I was just thinking it all in just like oh my God look at this so I I run out there man but um it was the first time I realized that dream dreams can actually come true and and for me that was so important because I felt like if my career would have ended right there I I would have made it um so obviously I played nine years after that uh but that moment was so special to me the next moment um unfortunately it was 2005 uh playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at home and Jerome Bettis got the ball about the three yard line yeah and and I put my my helmet right in his on the ball made a fly in the air he fumbled uh but unfortunately Nick Harper picked the ball up uh he didn't quite Zig when he K his zag yeah been rburg tackled him and it's crazy now um it's going down as the immaculate Redemption and and like the fumble was cut out so they just see Ben rothberger tackling Nick Harper now right that's the clip that you see in the edits but my mind is just one of those things like man until that clock turns z00 Z it's still opportunity to make a play 100% you were ready yes you made the play that was it Nick not so much not so much he now much and then we won't talk about the kick that happened after that it was a painful moment for me as a Colts man it was rough oh man when that ball came out I was going crazy but anyway but I'm glad that was that was yeah I'm sure y'all were too yeah yeah it was it was rough that's awesome well that's really cool I I have some rapid fire questions for you okay just some some some fun ones here and and then I want to dive into your faith a little bit uh okay favorite cartoon character Growing Up character um man uh Homer Simpson Homer Simpson all right that's awesome all right what's your favorite food uh favorite food was pizza pizza nice favorite

audience here Chiefs who's going Chiefs who's going Chiefs tonight all right ners who's going ners okay Brock pie is at church today I didn't even know that all right uh I I got the ners too I got the ners too well Gary tell us how did you come to faith in Christ yeah uh growing up you know my mother was trained to be a ordained Reverend okay so uh at the time you know I was told the guys earlier my mom had a drug problem uh she drugged me everywhere I needed to go so it was choir rehearsal okay right I mean this is the time where they had the Sister Act too so we we were doing all those all those HS um but yeah and and I I shared the story just how passionate she was about it and and it wasn't necessarily at church is where I found it but it was more so at home seeing how she lived her life M that's powerful and and it's one thing to like to feel it but it's another thing to see it and just how she lived her life I'm like man there's a guy somewhere there's no one this someone this kind this patient I mean we used some rambunctious kids um and she was just always there to support us and and to Believe in Us that's incredible yeah come on parents parents that love the Lord and hey keep keep dragging them to church right just keep on bringing them girl how about this what was maybe one of the most difficult Seasons you faced either professionally or personally and how did your faith get you through that season yeah so when when I was first in the NFL I got a call that October that my father who was a Vietnam vet um had unfortunately like died um pretty sudden wasn't quite aware of it um so I'm going home and you know um as a boy when I was growing up it was always like Mama when I when I make it I'mma to buy you a house um so that offseason I spent a lot of time my mom I'm actually buying her a house I I did all right after the 2009 signning bonus I figured out the suda Fooda thing and save some money um and um so we're going to put we put a down payment on the house and we're going to now you know the the area where you go to the builders and you pick out all the finishes and the Finish that she was picking out I was like Mom this is my first year in the NFL like I don't there's a budget thing we need to discuss you know um but unfortunately um that February she passed away wow yeah and you know what I realized is that she wasn't shopping for her physical home she was shopping for her Heavenly Home same time my brother uh was diagnosed with cancer um he had T Cell nor Blasco Kia um he was three years older than me okay um so we kind of look like twins which was good because in high school essentially when he turned 21 I turned 21 I don't know if you guys know what that mean if not you know um but um so I I I was his bone marrow donor my first year in the NFL that training camp um I was in the hospital uh like donating blood for him for his cancer and unfortunately he lost his life as well that was 18 of spam when I I lost my father my mother and then my brother wow um and a lot of times you question God yeah and I can remember going upstairs uh in my house um where my parents bathroom was at you know growing up it was like yo don't don't y'all I don't got no reason to be in our bathroom right but in their bathroom and I obviously snuck in there several times big house um but uh there was a painting in the poem that I never really looked at and realized until like when they were both going and planning all the the events and funerals um but the poem was Footprints okay and it talked about a man who in every area in in chance of his life when he he had a challenge he saw you know um two set of footprints but in in the worst time of his life he only saw saw one pair and he and he asked God like where were you at where I needs you most and that's what God responded my son at that moment that's when I carries you yeah so I I definitely at that moment feel like I was carried you know through those things and and you know um I I don't think the Lord puts anything on us that we can't bear and it just really made me value life yeah and how precious it is yeah yeah man thank you for sharing that that's really powerful Gary as as we wrap up could you just I'd love just if you could give one piece of advice or wisdom just to kind of tell our church family today man I am I'm I'm such a strong believer uh in the underdog and and the people that have been counting out um the people that weren't first place um and there is the quote that says hard work beats Talent when talent doesn't work hard and and I've just always been a firm believer that hard work works yeah and and I've learned in my life to realize even when I put in hard work it doesn't guarantee that I'm going to get to win yeah so then I've learned to fall in love with the process and divorce myself from the outcome that's good so so I'm going to move and I'm do everything I can in my power to get my desired result yeah but but if it doesn't happen and most times it doesn't it doesn't I'm not going to be discouraged yeah I'm I'm going to keep on moving I'm Gonna Keep on doing my part yeah that's awesome can we give it up for Gary bracket man Gary thank you so much brother thank you for your transparency thanks for sharing come on give it up for him again as he heads off what a powerful story Gary has a book called winning just has more about his life story he'll be out in the lobby and you can stop by and see them and if you want to purchase a copy I have a copy I've read the whole thing and uh uh man I just couldn't agree we talked about this I think last week you know the great things in life the uh they take hard work and uh that's that's biblical the Bible talks about uh hard work and and and good planning um but also talks about trusting in the Lord and so I hope today just here in Gary's story that you can see that he's just like you we all go through it nobody's life is perfect we all have challenges but if you will trust in the Lord he'll carry you through if you'll trust in the Lord he'll carry you through"
1Hp8_cGiLpo,how many of you in here today are believing for a bigger and better things in 2023 to happen in and through your life come on are you believing for that in 2023 well listen then we all need what I'm about to share with you to be a part of our plan strategy focus and priorities for this year today we are starting 21 days of prayer and fasting yeah come on you can give it up for the Lord I've been looking forward to it and so it starts today we do this every January we want to give the first of our year to God we want to start off by putting God first and dedicating the first of our year to him and coming closer to him the Bible says in James 4 8 it says when you draw close to God God will draw close to you and God wants to come close to you today but he's waiting on you and I to make the first move I know when God and I are walking close I'm better my attitude is better my actions are better my body language is better my Outlook on things is better and my relationships are so much better walking close to God makes every part of life better and every year during 21 days of prayer and fasting we see God do big things in so many people's lives people receive healing in their lives people experience breakthrough in their lives people gain Clarity on wisdom on making important decisions prayers are answered loved ones give their lives to Jesus as a result of our prayer and fasting to 21 days and for a lot of you this the the January this has been a part of your January Rhythm for quite some time but maybe some of you you're newer and you haven't gone on this journey yet or maybe you simply have some questions about prayer and fasting and that makes total sense and so I just want to take a couple minutes just shed some light on 21 days of prayer and fasting because it is so important for your spiritual health in 2023 and so starting tomorrow we will gather together at 6 a.m here in the building Monday through Friday we'll have a prayer service from 6 to 7 A.M and then on Saturdays a prayer service from 9 to 10 a.m and what we do is we have worship we have a a short Devo and then we have personal prayer time and then corporate prayer time so Monday through Friday 6 to 7 A.M and then Saturdays from 9 to 10 a.m how many I know power is released when God's people pray when they pray when they pray together and so these times absolutely will change the tone temperature and tune of your day and your year and fasting is an area that many people have questions on it especially if you're new some of you like this pastor asking me not to eat for 21 days why'd you bring me to the Church where'd you find this place coming back to this place no for some people it is oftentimes a fast does involve food and not eating and and giving up food and doing liquids some of you are like man praise the Lord I put on some pounds during the holidays I've been looking forward to the fast come on y'all I had my I had some Sundays I screamed last night it was like my last supper before these 21 days but let me help you give just a Biblical view of fasting fasting is essentially giving up something you desire or enjoy for a set amount of time to grow in your relationship with God and so many people do fast food and so for 21 days some may do a liquid fast where they'll just have water and juice for 21 days some will do a Daniel Fast we're for 21 days you'll just eat fruits and and vegetables and and nuts some people just do a specific meal they fast dinner for 21 days all right now some of you some of you you're like well hey I'm a Fast breakfast but you don't eat breakfast you're like yes I've been fasting my whole life praise the Lord you just realized you were spiritual no you got to give up a meal that you normally enjoy and and and eat okay and uh and you can mix it up I know some people they'll do one week they fast a meal and another week they may do Daniel Fast and they may try a couple days of of liquids only but it's basically it's giving up something that you enjoy and I don't know about y'all but I enjoy food so I'll be I'll be giving up food during my fast but I also know some people maybe can't do that kind of fast there's other fast you can give up social media you can give up television you can give up caffeine coffee you can give up sweets listen I don't want you to get hung up on the what okay and just remember why you're fasting so whatever it is pick something pick multiple things but you're giving up something that your flesh that you enjoy so that you can grow closer to God because I don't know about you but we need more of God's power I need more of God's power I need more of his peace I need more of his presence I need more of his provision and when we pray and fast we're going to get more of God yeah I can't even let my prayer life it elevates and escalates during this times of 21 days of prayer and fasting my flesh is going to be screaming but I need it I need it I've been looking forward to this time with God to grow closer to deny my flesh and for my spirit to grow strong see we give up to go up and I believe when you do that God will show up when you honor him because he still heals and restores he answers prayers and he provides for our need not enough for some of you enemies already whispering in your ear oh you didn't you already had a big breakfast today just start next time listen next time is not guaranteed for anybody the best time to start is now join us right now we start today 21 days of prayer and fasting I know some of you like me you can't be messing with my sleep Pastor I'm not messing with your sleep God is okay and God's saying hey for 21 days would you go to bed a little earlier because if you will do that so that you come and join us a 6 a.m prayer meeting I'm telling you it will shape your next 336 days of this year I know some of you love food you're like I don't know if I can do it listen give up what you love I love food okay I already got my January 29th meal planned y'all it is on the calendar it's on the calendar but you give up what you love for what you love more and that's God and it's worth the sacrifice to get more of God now I know some of you you may be working during those hours and you maybe cannot make it to the building there is an online option all right now that's at 7 00 a.m I also want to tell y'all about that because I know what some of you gonna do you could be here at 6am but you want to spend your time with the Lord in your bed and the PJs on your phone online and I'm saying come on would you get actually you can show up in your pjs it's okay would you come would you wake up would you get here would you be here at 6 00 a.m for the prayer meetings and if you can't make it join us at Seven online but I'm telling you something powerful God's people they come together in the same place and all sacrificing and fasting and praying together he moves in a mighty mighty way fasting in prayer it sets up sets us up to win the spiritual war we all fight every day and so today make the decision to go on the journey with us for the next 21 days and let's watch God move mightily listen the biggest breakthroughs I've had in my life have come from prayer and fasting every major decision made your decision for me my family we've gotten Clarity and answers from God through prayer and fasting decisions made in prayer it will be so we we make a list hey y'all last year during uh 21 days of prayer if Cohen was not potty trained by the end of 21 days of prayer he was not going to be able to keep going to his school you better believe we was praying and fasting for that brother to look because he did not want to go anywhere near the potty we're like Jesus make him love the pie I'm telling y'all during 21 days he loved that party oh he was like look at me Mommy and Daddy I went potty run around the house negative look look daddy come look I went potty yeah it was the power of God made my three-year-old love that party listen you have not because you ask not man I pray about everything everything everything and yet I've seen God do other things as well and so pull out your phone pull it out set that alarm for 5 30 come on set it set the reminder if you got an iPhone you just tell Siri hey Siri set my alarm for 5 30 a.m I'm hoping some of your phones just picked

learn a little bit more about people's church and we would love love love to connect with you we're going to get into the sermon today and the the title of my message is this is how we fight our battles this is how we fight our battles in the book of Exodus the main character of this story is Moses who is an Israelite and his journey is quite remarkable in Exodus chapter 14 they're saved by the Egyptian Army by crossing the Red Sea as God parted the water see God had chosen Moses to liberate God's people the Israelites and he was leading them on a journey to the land that God has promised them and so on 14 we see him cross through the Red Sea that God parted in chapter 15. they sing a worship song to God and God turns bad water into a refreshing stream for his people and then in chapter 16 they started getting a little hangry and they started complaining like God can you hook us up with some meat and so God bring down some quail and some bread from heaven for his people it was the first ever Chick-fil-A Exodus chapter 16. and then chapter 17 hits a little different have you ever had a chapter of Life Hit differently an unexpected phone call unanticipated loss unsolicited confrontation undesirable outcomes it's real and we've all been there in chapter 17 it starts off with this miraculous moment when God provides water from a rock this is a good thing it's a miracle it's an amazing thing and then the unexpected shows up loud and proud the Israelites are probably having a water from the rock pool party thanking God for his provision and then they are attacked have you ever been attacked in the middle of your attempt to do the right thing like you finally decide to forgive somebody and then they hurt you again or they post something about you when you're getting ready for six a.m probably do it 21 days Pastor I'm gonna be there your car won't start kids are cranky keys are lost this is going to be 21 days of disaster no no no I want you to look at we're going to look at chapter 17 together because life hits all of us and it hit the Israelites here they were celebrating God's been good and in verses 8 through 13 Exodus 17 8-13 it says while the people of Israel were still at refer them the Warriors of amalek attacked him Moses commanded Joshua choose some men to go out and fight the army of amalek for us tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill holding the staff of God in my hand so Joshua did what Moses had commanded and fought the army of amalek meanwhile Moses Aaron and her climbed to the top of the nearby Hill as long as Moses held up the staff in his hand the Israelites had the advantage but whenever he dropped his hand the amalekites gained the advantage Moses arms soon became so tired he could no longer hold them up so Aaron and er found a stone for him to sit on then they stood on each side of Moses holding up his hands so His Hands Held steady until sunset as a result Joshua overwhelmed the army of amalek in battle see adversity often shows up in our lives unexpectedly it often shows up in our lives uninvited and Moses models for us the blueprint for a battle plan when the enemy attacks see Moses didn't grab a sword and run into battle no no he gets with God he turns to worship he lifts his hands to the Lord and starts praying he realizes that he must have Supernatural intervention for the Victory and in 2023 even this week as you desire to grow closer to God the enemy will attack and try to stop you on your Jesus journey and you will need a supernatural intervention and today I want to challenge you to make the decision to dig in and win I want you to know that God's power will prevail over the enemy's plans if you dig in to win and this is what Moses did Moses let God's power drive his plans and so we're going to look at this passage I want to share three points with you today the first is this the first point there is power in the proper perspective there's power in the proper perspective verse 9 it says Moses commanded Joshua choose some men to go out and fight the army of amalek for us tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill holding the staff of God in my hands see the enemy was coming in hot and it had bad intentions planned for God's people and so Moses chose not to let fear blind his faith when the attack came he wasn't in denial over the situation but he was aware that it was bigger than him and last year I have no doubt you faced some battles that were incredibly challenging loss of a job slander by someone family issues Health scares people you love letting you down and with when tough times come knocking at our door it's easy to get discouraged feel down and wonder where God is and the enemy loves to talk loud in these times telling us all kinds of of lies about God and more he loves to tell us God doesn't care about you God isn't there for you Church isn't work are you trying to start your year off going to it's not going to work for you 21 days of prayer that's good for everybody else but 21 days isn't gonna help you however lies are easy to recognize when you see things from a higher perspective Moses climbed the mountain to get an accurate view of the situation that he was facing and in these next 21 days I believe God wants to speak clearly into our lives to help us win our Wars by seeing him and his ways correctly and clearly that God wants to elevate our Thinking by climbing the mountain of his truth that God wants to help us see the enemy for who he is a liar he wants us to see God's power for what it is unlimited to see people the way God does in need of Hope prayer and fasting always helps elevate my thinking I'm always praying and trying to hear from God but I'm telling you during 21 days of prayer and fasting when I fast and pray it's like God gives me this Vision he he gives me a view that I couldn't get without prayer and fasting he helps me to see things I was not seeing he helps reveals things I don't even know I need revealed I'm telling you during 21 days I've gotten clear clarity about things for my family for my marriage my own personal health my relationship with God the way that I lead and the way that I love and I don't know what God is going to do these next 21 days I just know he's gonna do and I'm saying God show me reveal to me help me see what I don't see give me wisdom on the decisions and the choices and and I'll be praying about all of it and I just know God is going to reveal that he gives me that Mountaintop view that peace begins to overtake problems and sometimes the problems don't even go away and they don't change but my view of them did and over time God takes care of all the pressures see Mountaintop moments lead to victories in the valley and Moses walked in power because his perspective was on point he knew God has come through before God has always provided God loves me always God is both with me and for me and so prayer and fasting will set your mind on the mountain of God's truth this year to win the war and battles and power is Unleashed when the truth is believed so there's power in the proper perspective number two there is power in the pursuit of God's Presence Power in the pursuit of God's presence look at verse 11. it says as long as Moses held up the staff in his hand the Israelites had the advantage but whenever he dropped his hands the amalekites gained the advantage when Moses climbed the mountain he didn't throw a picnic with friends because he was there for a purpose he knew that the secret to Victory wasn't his talents and abilities but rather in God's power moving in in and through him see when we come together tomorrow morning and every day following the next 20 days it will be on purpose to see God's power move in and through our lives see we must fight right to really achieve Victory this year come on worship to God is our Warfare the word of God is our weapon prayer with God is our power tool fasting is fuel for the fight and God wants you to win that's what he does it was in DJ Khalid that made up the song God is the only one that can say is all I do is win win no matter what he's the only one and I don't know about you I want to be on God's side I want to be on the winning side and that's coming from God and God Alone he's the only one that says all I do is win that's all he does and then I'm telling you praying fast you're going to win you're going to see victory you're going to see Victory when Moses was engaged with God Not only was he winning but it affected everyone attached to him when his hands were up people were winning when his hands went down they began to lose see when you are full of God's presence it begins to spill out of you and onto everyone around you Joy becomes your default prayer is a running conversation with god worship takes place at the church in the car at sporting events and everywhere else you go fasting doesn't feel like a burden because you are full of God's word and his ways Romans 15 13 it says may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope God wants to fill us with joy peace and hope so that it'll pour out of us and on to others Luke 6 45 it says the good person out of the good Treasure of his heart produces good and the evil person out of the evil treasure produces evil for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speak God wants you to be filled with good so that if your mouth will come in abundance of good not just for yourself but for others Psalm 23 5 it says you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup overflows people need you and I to overflow with Jesus because his hope will change your family and friends his healing is available to the broken he his help is stronger than whatever they are facing we need God ideas not just good ones we need biblical truth more than just opinions we need a move of God this year and that requires a move from us towards Jesus and one of the best ways we move towards God it's for prayer and fasting because prayer and fasting is saying I put myself second I put my needs and desires aside and I'ma press in more than I normally do more than I ever have before there's there's power in the pursuit of his presence and the number three there's power in partnership with God's people verses 12 and 13 it says Moses arms soon became so tired he can no longer hold them up so Aaron and er found a stone for him to sit on they then stood on each side of Moses holding up his hands so His Hands Held steady until sunset as a result Joshua overwhelmed the army of amalek in battle see Moses was an incredible leader but he couldn't do it all alone no one can the story says his arms soon became tired may have been 10 minutes it may have been an hour but nonetheless he needed help he can no longer on his own power hold up his arms and had his arms dropped the Army began to lose can you imagine if he went up to the hill by himself it would have ended very very differently because his arms would have fallen and and his people would have been defeated that day and it begs to ask if eggs asked the question why did God have Moses lift his hands for victory I believe he knew his arms would get tired and he would need help the principle is true today as it was then we need each other to be our best better together is not just for peanut butter and jelly coffee and cream or bacon and eggs sugar and Kool-Aid Burgers and Fries Pastor I'm fasting and you talking about this stuff what in the world sorry sorry but the point I'm trying to make is better together is for us and one of the most alarming things about our current culture is that we have some life approaches that won't set us up for success long term we're lonely but we won't talk to people we feel disconnected at times but we won't join a small group we struggle with finding our purpose but won't serve on the Dream Team we want our kids to be God honoring but they aren't NPC kids or epic student Ministries our schedules are busy to the point that we don't have the margin to say yes to God opportunities when they arrive and please hear my heart on this I'm not trying to meddle or say quit your jobs and hang out at church all day that's not what I'm saying but listen you got to surrender to God's battle plan so that you can win in 2023 and God's battle plan for success is that we go to war with other Warriors not by ourselves just like Moses we need the body of Christ to win the war listen life is challenging enough during the best seasons and even in the best seasons you will get tired and at some point like Moses your hands will begin to drop and you need an errand come on you need a small group you need people that'll help lift up your arms and pray for you encourage you you got times where your arm's gonna get tired and you need a UR you need other dream teamers that are around you that are loving on you and checking upon you and praying for you and serving with you together to help lift up your arms to pray to shift your perspective to Speak Life to remind you that God is for you and with you and that's why committing to attend church in 2023 matters so much that's why serving on the Dream Team in 2023 matters so much listen if you are not on the Dream Team will you join in 2023 the pastor how do I do that go to growth track growth track is the number one way to get on the Dream Team you matter of fact you go to growth track today it's at 12 30 after this service you go to growth track today get on the Dream Team around other believers that you can serve with some of you've already gone through growth trip maybe for whatever reason you haven't you haven't joined the Dream Team join today and I'm telling you it matters so much that's why being a part of a small group in 2023 it matters so much I'll go Pastor how do I lead a small group how do I join a small group you can text PC groups to 940 you'll get a link text back to you click the link and just fill out that form there and let us know if you want to lead or join a small group or you can stop by our small group table and talk to our small group team in the lobby but I'm telling you We Are Better Together listen we need each other get in a small group in 2023 that's why having your kids in church every Sunday in 2023 matters so much that's why having your student at Epic Youth Services every Wednesday matters so much that's why attending the 6 a.m prayer service every day matters so much we win battles together when we are tired we have to hold up each other's arms and Moses and the Israelites they won that battle together and we will win if we fight together if we pray together if we serve together if we give together if we worship together if we pray together I'm telling you we we will win if we will 21 days before fast and pray together there is power when the body of Christ comes together in agreement seeking the face of God his word says he'll heal our land his word says he'll do a mighty work of Miracles and breakthrough and the best way to do it is together God created us to do it together [Music] and every 21 days of prayer and fasting we see God do amazing things sometimes instantly sometimes it's over time I remember a lady at our church coming up she passed a passenger in 21 days of prayer and faster fasting I asked God God spoke to me about quitting smoking she said I quit during 21 days this was months after I haven't picked up a cigarette since I have no desire for it God delivered me from that addiction [Music] every year I'm praying for friends neighbors people I know that don't know Jesus to be saved by name in January I had a list and during 21 days of prayer and fasting not one of those people got saved but three of them got saved in June another one got saved last month [Music] some of them still aren't safe guess what they're going right back on my list they haven't left my list 21 days of prayer and fasting I'm praying and believing for their salvation for them to come to Christ this building you're in right now since we started People's Church here in Indy we've been doing prayer and fasting we were praying and fasting for a new building back in 2017 2017 we prayed and fast for a building 2018 we pray and fast for a building 2019 we pray and fast for a Building 2020 got into the prayer and gave us this building right before covet that has allowed us to be where we're at today and reaching as many people as we are it's God prayer and fasting it's asking God to open the door that only he can door open we don't even want to open the door we want God to open it and guess what August of 2021 we started praying for a new building that we could own and not lease a new building that's in a prime location where you can actually see it off the road you know what I'm saying I thank God that all of you found us but I'm we're just praying and we're believing it's during prayer and fasting we're believing last year we prayed and fast God said knock on doors we knocked on many couple look like they may open I just believe this year God's going to answer that prayer and it's because of prayer and fasting it's the power of God that's going to open the doors that we can't open ourselves and so make the decision this year to lock in for 21 days of prayer and fasting put it on your calendar pick the times join us if you've never done it before man do at least one if you did two last time do four this time if you did one week last time try to do a week and a half or two weeks I'm telling you there's listen God's power is still available to his people God heals he helps and he wants us to be full of Hope it's on 2023 let's be committed to God's house together serve on the Dream Team together in a small group together get our kids in teens to Epic and church together give together pray and fast together
fcWbg95pwac,well today uh we're going to take a one week break from our series angels and demons I know that Series has been so insightful um and next week uh I'm going to start teaching on demons and what the Bible says about demons it's going to be rich it's going to be insightful I would encourage you to invite your friends and and neighbors we're going to learn to live in victory over the devil and his uh forces and so that will we will recontinue or we'll continue that series next Sunday but today we're we're we're taking a pause because this is a pivotal time of the year we are a week away from 21 days of prayer and 21 days of prayer such an important time uh that I want to take this Sunday to to preach a message is to just prepare our hearts and Minds fill us with just excitement and expectancy for what God is going to do when his people will come together and pray for these 21 days I know I I can't I need this time I'm looking forward to it it's going to be August 11th through the thir I cannot wait I love it and I need it uh and so to get us ready for 21 days of prayer the title of my message today is believe believing for a breakthrough believing believe for a breakthrough after uh I became a Christian I got involved in my church and I joined uh their dream team and and and I actually became uh the worship leader for our youth group and so every Wednesday night I was leading the the youth group in worship and every week we would have practice and on one of these nights practice just wasn't going the way I wanted it to I was messing up we were having all kinds of issues and I was starting to get frustrated you know what I mean I'm just starting to get frustrated and it was like it was one of those nights it was not getting better it was starting to get worse and I could feel my temper and frustration start to boil a little bit I I felt it starting to boil and I'm getting mad I'm getting frustrated and I can't remember what happened but something else happened that just went wrong and I snapped I was like boom and I I punched the wall where our youth group logo was and I put a nice little Dent of my Knuckles uh in the wall what's funny is the name of our youth group group was rage uh that was maybe not the best uh youth group name for me because truth be told I had a problem with rage um I had anger problems where my anger would get out of control and at times it would lead to destruction or banging things or or or breaking things and I had that problem long before I was a teen I I remember being a kid with the video games throwing my controller across the the the the room cussing out the v i mean I'd be yelling and screaming like like like the Super Nintendo was offended or something you know what I mean like I know nothing about that Super Nintendo but but I I I just had this this this anger this rage it had a control it had a it had a grip on my life there are other times where I would be banging and breaking stuff matter of fact one time I was playing video games with my friend we were at his house and I was getting so mad I I'd kick his wall and one time I got so mad I kicked the wall and kicked a hole in his wall I was like my bad man and so we put a poster over it put a I don't know when they found it but my friend was like what's wrong with you and I just there was this rage just anger anger had control of my life even after becoming a Christian I remember we were doing a church Outreach we were inviting the whole community outreach for kids and teens uh I actually I I led worship um that day and and and and we had Inflatables that were out you know kind of like the kids carnival we do here at People's Church and uh there was a a a gentleman a a a peer of mine that was there and and we just you know we just didn't really like each other much but I you know hey man I'm be Godly you know I don't need to be I'll be high smile and all that stuff well anyway at the Outreach um he played a prank on me and y'all I lost it in front of all these families and kids I'm like you want to go you want to go go I mean I'm ready to fight we are in front of everybody youth leaders P they are holding me back I'm yelling I'm screaming they had to pull me into the church they were like what is wrong with you and I remember in that moment like what is wrong with me like y'all this is supposed to we're supposed to be winning people to Jesus and I'm out here trying to yell and and fight and I remember like having just a moment later to myself with God where I was like I need a breakthrough I need a breakthrough and listen the reality is we all have issues go ahead tell your neighbor tell your neighbor you have issues come on goad tell them y'all judging me from you could go ahead tell them you have issues we all have issues none of us are perfect we all can have vices we all can face mountains that we don't think we can climb or overcome we all have areas in our life where we need a breakthrough you may need a breakthrough from an addiction a behavior a situation maybe you need a breakthrough in a relationship your finances maybe you need a spiritual breakthrough need a breakthrough in your health and your marriage with your children at work a a at school maybe you're like me you need a a breakthrough with anger or or a breakthrough with depression anxiety fear and other areas there may be some of you in here and and that man 2024 hasn't been your year and we're only halfway through and some of you you may feel locked up you may have felt this way for a long time and you want no no no you need you need a breakthrough well I want you to know today you came to the right place because we serve a god of the Breakthrough Jesus is in this place and he can help you get a breakthrough and so I I want to share with you three ways as we get ready for this 21 days I want us to believe for a breakthrough and I want to share with you three ways to get a breakthrough the the first way is this ask God ask God listen God wants you to come to him with your problems and issues and God will give you a breakthrough but we have to ask and asking God for help is done through prayer prayer is the primary way that we communicate with God it's talking to God it's being real with God and listen there may be nobody else that wants to hear about your problems but God does you may have all kinds of people that are sick and tired of you but God isn't he never gets sick and tired of you he says come to me all who are weary and heavy burdened cast all your cares to you can bring bring it all you can unload on God and he's like give me some more you haven't given it all to me come on Keep It Coming Keep It Coming Keep It Coming you can give him everything you can go to God with all your situations with the stuff with your family your personal life areas you need a breakthrough asking God praying to God crying out to God is the first step toward a breakthrough in the book of Acts there's a story about Paul Paul and Silas and to give a little bit of context Paul and Silas they were on their way to a place of prayer this was a routine for them they were going to a place of prayer and on their way they came across a girl that was demon-possessed and so they they cast out this demon I mean how how about that you know I mean you on the way to prayer before you even pray you just pray and someone gets delivered and then you I mean that's a good day that's a spiritual high right there so their day day days is going pretty good but then there were masters of this young girl and they were using her to make money and they were they were upset with what Paul and Silas did and so they reported them and so then Paul and Silas they were arrested they were beaten and then they were thrown into prison how many I know life comes at you fast you know what I mean you go from what spiritual High to all of a sudden you're going to the lowest of lows beaten and thrown into prison and the Bible says acts 16:25 it says around midnight Paul and Silas were praying they were talking to God they were crying out and singing hymns to God and the other prisoners were listening it says at midnight Paul and Silas were praying they were in a rough situation they needed a break through and the first thing they do is pray and I want to I want to I want to point out and and I want to go back to where they were going before they were arrested because I think this plays a a huge part in Paul and Silas in their life and their lifestyle and the kind of people they were in Acts 16:6 it says once we were going to the place of prayer they were going to a place of prayer see see this place they they regularly went to pray these men always prayed it was an established discipline in their life prayer was a part of their lifestyle and so when they were in a tough situation when they needed a breakthrough after being beaten and thrown into prison at midnight they started to pray listen if your prayer life is dry non-existent if your prayer life is struggling inconsistent 21 days is a great way to Kickstart your prayer life and so August 11th through the 31st we're starting 21 days of prayer and this is a great way to Kickstart your prayer life to get some consistency to get to where Paul and Silas were where where prayer is not always a a hail marry for you but prayer it's just a part of what you do and who you are they were going to a place of prayer they didn't get there they got beat up thrown into prison and they said hey we don't need to be there to pray we going to pray right here in this prison because it's who they were and so I want to encourage you these 21 days of prayer would you make it a priority we're going to have prayer services every week August 11th through the 31st we're going to have a prayer service on Monday nights from 6:00 p.m. to 700 p.m. we're going to have prayer services Tuesday through Thursday uh 12:00 p.m. to 1 p.m. Friday morning 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and then Saturday 9:00 a.m. to 10: a.m. we're we're doing all these different times so that every one of us can attend a prayer service listen would you make it a priority would you put it on your schedule right now whatever time or times work for you come to prayer come to these prayer services maybe you've never been to a prayer service before you're like what do you do you just pray for an hour this is what we do we start off with a little bit of worship start with a little bit of worship we have a dvo and then after the dvo we have a time of personal prayer we have personal prayer for about 20 minutes you're like Pastor I a never prayed for 2 minutes you want me to pray for 20 minutes we give you tools we have a little prayer booklet we have slides see we want to help you learn how to pray and how to pray longer you you know one is the best ways I learned how to pray watching others pray so I learned how to pray and so after the personal prayer time one of our staff or leaders will come up and we have a time of corporate prayer and someone's praying on the mic and we're we're praying with them for about 10 minutes I'm telling you if you need to get your prayer life reactivated started it needs a jolt listen get to one of these prayer service make a commitment to be a part of 21 days of prayer lock in the dates make a commitment like Paul and Silas and come to the place of prayer this was a discipline for Paul and Silas so when they needed a breakthrough they prayed when they needed to breakr prayer was their first line of defense not their last resort that's and this is what happened next acts 16:26 it says suddenly there was a massive earthquake and the prison was shaken to its foundations all the doors immediately flew open and the chains of every prisoner fell off they prayed and the god of the Breakthrough came through he set them free and in order for us to have a breakthrough in our lives we need to pray we need to ask God you got to pray every day prayer will play a big part in our breakthrough see the same power that set them free when they prayed is the same power that will set us free when we pray it plays a huge part in our lives and you got to pray every day and about everything 1 Thessalonians 5:17 it says pray continually some translations say pray every day or pray without ceasing when turbulence hits when I'm on a plane I pray and I don't stop praying till the turbulence stops or the plane lands when my dad had a heart attack I prayed when I needed a breakthrough in my marriage I prayed and I kept on praying when I've been hit with panic attacks I pray and I keep praying till it goes away when I feel like I'm about to blow up I pray and I keep praying the first step to a breakthrough is to Simply ask God listen it's not about being perfect or having the perfect prayer it's about being consistent it's just about being consistent praying because prayer is the first step towards a breakthrough listen when it came to my anger I literally felt like I was in a prison and I felt like I was in a prison that I could not get out of I thought man this is just this is just the way I am and I remember somebody asking me do you pray every day about your anger no you need to start praying about it every day and so that's what I did every day and man I wish I could told you I just prayed one prayer and poof anger gone no I had to pray every day every day sometimes throughout the day I had to pray when the Cults were losing I had to pray when that person cut me off Pray when my family getting on my nerves Pray when I'm just in a bad mood I mean I had to keep I had to keep praying I had to pray every day but you know what the more and more I prayed the more self-control I begin to have the more and more I prayed the more aware I was of the triggers and life and the things that were setting me off I'm like why am I still playing golf why am I paying $40 to want to cuss out this little white ball thank you Lord I haven't played golf since the more and more I prayed the more and more this mouth that was used to cause destruction would now keep closed now I still thought some stuff but I had to pray those away too and I just had to pray and keep praying and you know what the more and more I prayed listen God has given me a breakthrough he has Set Me Free he's helped me and you know what today I still have to pray boy that little booger bear anger it likes to come back it likes to sneak up and try to get me and I still have to pray but Ben prayer prayer prayer prayer Pray ask God you need a breakthrough at work pray and keep praying you need a breakthrough from an addiction pray and keep praying you need a breakthrough in your spiritual life pray and keep praying you need a breakthrough from an emotion that's controlling you like anger pray and keep praying or from depression anxiety and fear pray and keep praying you need a breakthrough in a relationship pray and keep praying you're trying to find the right one pray and keep praying you need a breakthrough in your marriage pray and keep praying to get a breakthrough we have to pray number two second way is commit to attending church every Sunday Paul and Silas they were going to a place of prayer they're going to a place of worship like a church and here's what God's word tells us in Hebrews chapter 10:2 it says some people have gotten out of the habit of meeting for worship and it's so easy life's too busy it's too hot I just need a break I need more sleep it's raining the Colts are playing I got a 8:30 for you now you can come to church tailgate and cheer the Colts on to a win a had a b experience at church it's the only day with my family the list can go on and on and on but look what the word of God says it says some people have gotten out of the habit of meeting for worship but we must not do that we should keep on encouraging each other especially since you know that the day of the Lord's coming is getting closer I can tell you that being at church Faithfully played a major part in many breakthroughs in my life I know some of you thinking yeah pastor but the all that anger you needed to be in church my goodness and you're right I needed as much Jesus as possible but you know what you know what faithful Church attendance did it gave me new friends I was praying for new friends I needed new friends I had friends that wanted a party and drink and all that stuff I needed friends that love God that want to pray you know what I mean that they want to have a worship party party you know what I mean like I needed friends like that and where I attending church every Sunday is where I found those friends it was a it was a breakthrough it was in church where I started to serve and discovering passions and gifts I never knew I had never in my wildest dreams would I be on a microphone speaking publicly in front of hundreds of people there ain't no way if you would have told me I'd be doing that in high school I would have been like there ain't no way but I got to start serving in church and all of a sudden I started discovering passions I didn't know I had I started discovering gifts I didn't know that I had major breakthrough just by being in church many sermons impacted my life matter of fact it was a sermon that helped that Pastor Herbert preached that helped Jamie and I get free financially it was a message he preached about getting out of debt and not being a Slave to the lender and it was it was a sermon it was a message it was being in church it led to a major breakthrough and come on church is where I got saved the greatest breakthrough of all there is no other breakthrough better than that it was in a Wednesday night church service that I gave my life to Jesus and have been changed ever since being at church every Sunday it's changed my life and and and since I was saved I don't miss I need this this I need the worship I need the teaching I I need the fellowship there's power and being in God's house M matter of fact I I I remember I remember a time I wasn't going to go to church uh this was when they had they had Sunday uh church had Sunday night service and I would go every I'd go every Wednesday night Sunday morning and Sunday night and uh the Cults lost a playoff game we were the number one seed best record in the NFL worked all that time for a by week and we lost to the Titans I was so M I was like I'm not even going to church I'm I was just so I was so angry I was I had issues y'all was petty but sitting in my house angry thinking about all the reasons we lost that game and shouldn't have lost that game how we got away all that all that and then I finally was like okay you know what this is stupid I just need to go to church so I went to church I got there late and can I tell you that was one of the most impactful Services I've ever been to in my life I can remember saying thank God I did not skip thank God I did not miss it was it was such a and listen I I've been pastoring for almost 20 20 years now and I have lost count of all the people that have come up to me on a Sunday and said pastor I was not going to come today but I'm so glad I did I'm so glad I did that service was for me and listen I I am I am nobody important that was God that was the Holy Spirit don't miss a Sunday because every Sunday is an opportunity for a breakthrough every Sunday is an opportunity for a revelation every Sunday is an opportunity for a Divine appointment every Sunday to be in his presence and to meet somebody listen don't miss one Sunday you listen being at church every single Sunday will lead to a breakthrough be committed to church it's it's an opportunity to hear God's word to worship with others to pray together commit to it we even have four options for you now you got a busy day kids got a ball game at 10: or 11: you can come to the 8:30 you had a late night that's okay we got a 1:00 sleep on in wake up at 12:00 roll out of bed and come to church we got you covered don't miss one Sunday parents of of middle school high school students bring your students to Epic every Wednesday night every Wednesday is an opportunity for a breakthrough you've been praying some stuff over over your kids you're like Jesus touch this child bring them on Wednesday he'll touch him he'll touch him my kids are here every Wednesday everyone my son's here every Sunday and my kids I don't want to go into services to you you going to the service that's why you you need to go to the services today you cuz every every Wednesday is an opportunity with the worship with the message with the power of God to work every Wednesday it's an opportunity for their life to be changed forever the Bible says some people have gotten out of the habit of meeting for worship but we must not do that attending church Faithfully can bring a breakthrough in your life your kids and your teenagers it is impossible to get too much of Jesus and so we got the we have the four-week challenge coming up we got the four like Pastor are you bribing me to come to church man listen I'll bribe you to get to Jes Jesus I will cuz I just know what Jesus will do for you so yeah I got some donuts on August 18th come but it's a four-week challenge listen success starts on Sunday and if you don't want to come this why I got the kids carnival on September the 1st so your kids are going to be bugging you every day and every night about coming to church I'm just telling you in this place every Sunday the spirit of God is moving and speaking and when you come in here with an expectant heart and ready I'm telling you God has something for you every single week and so get here every single Sunday attend church weekly and and then the Third Way the third way to get a breakthrough is to pray to fast and pray to fast and pray um so so in the story with Paul and Silas in prison they were they were praying and they were singing s singing hymns but there's another story in Acts 13 where Paul is with Barnabas and it says in Acts 13 that they fasted and prayed and then they went out to preach into these cities and if you read that chapter it says the word of God spread throughout the whole region everywhere they went breakthrough were happening people getting saved and touched by the word of God there there's another story in the bible where jesus his disciples they couldn't cast a demon out of of a little boy again next week we're going to dive in next four weeks we're going to be diving into demons we're going to be diving into the Bible and what it says and so make sure you're here as we continue that series but there's a there's a story where he couldn't cast a demon out of a little boy and so they brought the boy to Jesus and Jesus cast out the demon and they asked Jesus why they couldn't cast out the the demon and look what he says in Matthew 17: 20 21 so Jesus said to them because of your unbelief for assuredly I say to you if you have faith as a mustard seed you will see you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you and then verse 21 he says however this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting there are some breakthroughs that will only come through the combat ation of prayer and fasting when I started going to church fasting was a foreign word to me when they explained it to me it became even more foreign what do you mean not eating look at me I love to eat I don't know what's going on here I don't I thought it was ungodly because I love to eat but fasting it it's simply denying our flesh and by flesh I mean our desires and our and our wants and we deny them to spend more time with God so that we can grow closer to God fasting it weakens our flesh because our flesh is always craving something okay it's always craving something but it weakens our flesh so our spirit and our relationship can get stronger and again Jesus said there are some breakthroughs that will only happen through prayer and fasting and so some people they will fast food for certain amount number of days or whatnot they won't eat any food they'll drink water or maybe they'll drink juice and and then they'll replace their meal times with uh a spending time with God because if you fast and don't spend more time with God that's really just a bad diet you you know what I'm saying and so it's it's it's replacing that time and spending more time praying and reading your Bible and worshiping there's there's a Daniel Fast where you can just eat fruits and vegetables and and drink water but you're also you're spending more time with God some people will Fast media they they'll fast TV or fast social media for 21 days or a certain amount of days but again they are then spending more time with God that the purpose of fasting is making a sacrifice so we can grow closer to God and Jesus said there are some strongholds that aren't broken except by prayer and fasting and so it's about less of me and more of God and and these 21 days so normally in January uh we do we ask everybody to do a fast 21 days it's prayer and fasting in August we typically do 21 days of prayer but I'm I'm going to be doing some fasting I need some breakthroughs I need some breakthroughs and so I'm going to be picking some days and I'm going to be doing some fasting with praying again Jesus said there's some breakthroughs that only happen through combining prayer with fasting okay and listen whenever you try to fast all right listen you're you're going to be tempted okay so you you you you maybe decide here I'm a fast Meats for 21 days I'm not going to eat any meat okay that's when somebody's going to be like man I want to bless you with the Ruth Chris dinner you know what I mean let's come get some steak together you need to say can we do that on September the 1st can we anyway we can we can make that happen but it's listen the enemy knows the enemy knows the power he experienced it he he he knows what Jesus taught his disciples you got to fast and pray he knows the the power of that and so if he can get you to not do it he he he will but I want to encourage you if you've never fasted during these 21 days take a day to fast maybe fast some meals and again spend more time with God grow deeper in your faith God will honor your sacrifice and your obedience combining fasting with prayer it'll help us get a breakthrough and every time we've done 21 days of fasting and prayer listen I've I've heard so many breakthroughs that God has done I've had somebody tell me during 21 days of pray prayer and fasting they've been able to quit smoking and never touch it again I've heard people say during 21 days that God just completely remove their anxiety just completely just like that set them free praise God and listen that that's not always the case I still wrestle with my anxiety but you know what I do when it comes I pray I pray I pray I pray I've heard of promotions at jobs I've heard of people being healed I don't know what God's going to do I just know God will do it and and listen I've needed many breakthroughs in my life many many I needed to break through with my anger I needed to break through with anxiety and panic panic attacks I needed a breakthrough in my marriage I needed a breakthrough in my parenting I've needed a breakthrough with my health my finances and God has done more than I deserve but listen there's a common theme to every breakthrough I've experienced Prayer church and fasting more and more of God and listen I need some breakthroughs right now I'm praying praying and I'm believing I know there's others that need breakthroughs I'm making my list for 21 days of prayer I would encourage you make a list I got list of specific things that I'm believing God for a breakthrough for and you know what's been incredible during 21 days of prayer 21 days of prayer and fasting I've seen God give me a breakthrough in some of my specific things but you know what have been some of the most amazing things God done in my life is the breakthroughs he gave me that I didn't even know I needed I wasn't even praying for that and God just hits me between the eyes I mean some of the greatest breakthroughs I have had some of the greatest Revelations is it's healing an area I didn't even know I need healing in it's a breakthrough in an air I didn't even know but that time of coming together and praying and fasting and seeking the face of God it has been lifechanging and so I can't wait I can't wait and so would you make it a priority would you put it on your calendar I I don't know what God is going to do I just know he will do when his people will humble ourselves and pray and will seek his face would you put those prayer services come on put them on your calendar listen in this crazy and chaotic world right now would you hit a pause on life and say I need to what do I need to move what do I need to move right now so in these 21 days I can pray more than I've ever prayed before and these 21 days I'm going to go to more prayer services than I've ever been before in these 21 days I'm going to fast more than I've ever fast and in these 21 days I'm going to seek the face of God more than I've ever seen him before and I'm telling you you are going to see God do incredibly you're going to see him do exceedingly and abundantly more than you could ever ask or imagine he is the god of the Breakthrough and I'm believing I'm believing I'm believing God has a breakthrough for me and he has a breakthrough for you and so let's go after God let just clear out that time let's go after him and let's see what God is going to do
4U4wtEf4i7Y,well today we are uh continuing our series called speed kills and the title of my message today is the silent killer week one of this series I talked to you about five stages to sabotaging your success even your life the first stage is hubris which is a foolish amount of pride or confidence the second is life mismanagement and bad habits third is Indulgence and compromise fourth is isolation and secrecy in the fifth stage is self-deceived and today I want to talk about hubris I want to talk about the foolish amount of pride or confidence because pride is the source of so much of our business sabotaging our life with busyness always begins with pride look at Proverbs 18 12. the Bible says before a downhaul the heart is haughty or prideful before someone's life comes crashing down there's pride in their heart Proverbs 16 18 it says Pride goes before destruction in a haughty spirit before a false see before someone sabotages their life with destruction there's pride in their heart matter of fact sin first originated in heaven when the devil became full of Pride he wanted to be like God he wanted to be God look at Isaiah 14 verse 12-14 it says how you have fallen from Heaven Morning Star son of the Dawn you have been cast down to the Earth you who once laid Lo the Nations you said in your heart I will Ascend to the heavens I will raise my throne above the stars of God God I will sit enthroned on the Mount of assembly and the utmost Heights of Mount zathon I will Ascend above the top of the clouds I will make myself like the most high Satan's heart it got full of Pride and then came his downfall and destruction he was the worship leader in heaven he was in God's presence every day but Pride sabotaged his success it was Pride that brought sin into the Earth the devil tempted Eve with the same prideful sin he had look at Genesis 3 5. he said for God knows that when you eat from it from the tree they weren't supposed to eat from your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil Eve disobeyed God's instruction in the Garden of Eden because of a desire to be like God she sabotaged her her success because of Pride and so many consequences followed that prideful decision see the rugged reality is that Pride narcissism conceit vanity egotism self-importance continues as Mankind's most prevalent and foundational sin and pride is so dangerous because it's a silent killer it's hard to detect in your life it's so deceptive it's so blinding look what Jeremiah 49 16 says it says the terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you Pride will deceive you it blinds you you don't see clearly when you are full of Pride I've been seeing the eye doctor since I was in high school and you know when you go into the eye doctor if you've ever been in they have you sit in a chair and they put this contraption over your face that you can look through and they ask you can you read the letters on the bottom line and they use some tricky letters like why you got to put an e up there got me into thinking is it an e or a b or they got the C is it a o or a c come on how are you like me you guess sometimes you just be yeah that's why your eyes are still bad because they giving the wrong prescription because we we guessing sometimes and and then they they finally find the one you can read and then they start changing the lenses okay which one is better this one or this one y'all know what I'm talking about they're like the first one or the second one how many all know they'd be playing tricks with your mind sometimes and y'all like me I'm like can you go back to the first one okay back to the second one I'm stressed out but listen I want to make sure I'm getting the right lenses y'all because if I don't get the right lenses I cannot see the power of these lenses allow me to see all of your beautiful and smiling faces but when I take these bad boys off it is a blur up in here even y'all on the front row I can't even make out your faces I don't even know what that says on the screen I'm dead serious I cannot read those where I am blind as a bat without these powerful lenses these powerful lenses help me see clearly because without them I am blind and we need the power of the Holy Spirit to help us see through Pride we need God's lenses to see and expose the pride in our lives that will kind us to be blind that will cause us to be busy and break our life the reality is as we all struggle with pride and if you don't recognize pride in your life it's because you have pride in your life it's hiding because pride is blinding it's deceptive and when you don't recognize it you can't deal with it and hidden Pride it is the root cause of busyness and the book crazy busy the author Kevin De Young he writes this our understanding of busy must start with the one sin that begets so many of our other sins Pride more of it is a work more of it is at work in our hearts than we know and more of it is pulsing through our busyness than we realize he says pride is a villain with a thousand faces and it's so true pride is a villain with a thousand faces and I don't have time for a thousand points today but I want to point out some of the biggest faces of pride in our life some major faces of Pride the the book crazy busy mentions because here's what happens with pride when when we pride it it blinds us we cannot see we cannot see we are blinded by pride and as long as we are blinded by it we will stay busy and busy we'll keep wrecking our life and so let me share with you the first bit of Pride that blinds us and deceives us it's the pride of people pleasing the pride of people pleasing that's the first face of Pride people pleasing is is trying to do too many things because we say yes to too many people we say yes to all these people because we fear disapproval and we want them to like us people Pleasers are always trying to meet other people's expectations and that will wear you slick out they're so busy saying yes to more and more people Lecrae said it this way he said if you live for people's acceptance you will die from their rejection here's how the Bible says that in Galatians chapter 1 verse 10 it says obviously I'm not trying to win the approval of people but of God if people pleasing were my goal I would not be Christ's servant if people pleasing is your goal you are not serving Christ you are serving people and you are blinded to this Pride that is wearing you slick out it is where and you're wearing yourself out let me give you the the second face of pride that we get blinded to that that deceives us and that's the pride of pats on the back the pride of pets on the back this is probably the most obvious kind of Pride it's living for the praise of people it's kind of like people pleasing but it's less motivated by fear of what people think about you and it's more about you getting the credit and the glory see this kind of pride is always busy seeking after the affirmation of people the validation of people the praise of people and people where themselves out seeking paths on the back Proverbs 25 27 it says it is not good to eat too much honey and it's not good to seek honors for yourself the pride of pets on the back has us blinded deceived let me give you the third Pride that has us blinded and deceived it's the pride of prestige the pride of prestige after two weeks of pre-K Linda's five-year-old grandson came home with a mighty big compliment Little Nick told his grandmother that he was the smartest kid in the class with a deep sense of Pride Linda asked him is that what the teacher said Nick replied no ma'am I had to tell her yeah how do you show I think they're performing at a high level studies consistently show that all students rate themselves above average almost all employees consider themselves in the top tier almost all pastors think they're strong preachers almost all leaders think that they're better leaders and they really are it's our prideful tendency to think too highly or so highly of ourselves we tend to overestimate our importance we think we're so important in our own eyes we we say things like this if I want anything done right I'll do it myself right if they just would have listened to me they would not be in this mess everybody else is wrong in my perspective is right if I were them I would have or if I was running this place oh it would be so much better if I was the boss oh that would have turned out so much better if I was preaching today hey hold up hold up Proverbs 26 12. it says do you see a person wise in their own eyes there is more hope for a fool than for them T.S Eliot said most of the trouble in the world is caused by people wanting to be important people think I'm so important I'm so indispensable and they're blinded to this pride and you're wearing yourself out let me give you another face of Pride that we're blinded to it is the pride of performance the pride of performance this person's pride is driven by performance the their pride for performance it drives them to becoming a workaholic they live to perform they will sacrifice their marriage their children their faith in God for performance I have to work more hours to be valuable I have to get this job done to be important and I will confess to you that when I was a youth pastor in Oklahoma City the youth ministry just started blowing up it was growing rapidly 100 Kids 200 300 400 and I let the pride of performance get in my heart that I started becoming a workaholic I started sacrificing my family and my marriage time because I want to continue to perform and continue to see it grow and you know what happened I got in a very unhealthy place I got in a place that was not good and I was blinded by the pride of performance in my life and it was keeping me busy it was keeping me unhealthy and it was starting to even wreck my life that the pride of performance we can be blinded to us and it's it's wearing us out it's breaking us not blessing us let me give you the next feather the next face face of Pride and that is the pride of possessions the pride of possessions in Proverbs 16 19 the Bible says better to live humbly with the poor than to share plunder with the proud see when the pride of possessions begin to drive people their life becomes consumed with money money and possessions they're busy chasing after more and more and more and neglect what really matters in life they're consumed with working to get more money and more stuff and more money and more stuff and hear me it's not bad to desire a better car a new couch a new home nice clothes the problem comes when people take pride in their stuff and it drives them to an unhealthy life in the pride of possessions it can be hard to see that it's Wrecking our life and it's causing us to have an unhealthy Pace let me give you the next Pride that we're blind and we're deceived by that's the pride of proving myself the pride of proving myself listen God isn't against ambition the right kind of ambition for God's glory it can inspire people to do great things for the kingdom of God but ambition birthed out of Pride drives us to prove ourselves and we never rest some of you are so busy because you're still trying to prove yourself to your parents and you're 40 years old some of you you're so busy because you're trying to prove yourself to an old boss and you left that job 10 years ago some of you are so busy because you're still trying to prove yourself to your high school classmates and you graduated when MC Hammer was on the top of the Billboard charts you know what I'm saying you can't touch this [Music] yeah that's not a very good MC Hammer but but y'all know what I'm saying you're busy trying to prove yourself some of you trying you're so busy trying to prove yourself to an old spouse and you've been divorced for over 20 years now you are wearing yourself out Colossians 3 23 it says work willingly at whatever you do as though you were working for the Lord rather than people hear me today you don't need to prove yourself to anybody you're working for the Lord yeah but pride has us deceived has us blinded let me give you the next face of Pride it's the pride of pity the pride of pity some people's Pride it manifests in pity they they like people to feel sorry for them they always have the poor old me's it reminds me of Elijah First Kings 18 22 then Elijah said to them I'm the only one of the Lord's prophets left no he wasn't but he had the pride of pity in First Kings 19 10. look what he said to God he replied I've been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty the Israelites have rejected your Covenant torn down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword I'm the only one left and now they're trying to kill me too he was not the only one left everybody feels sorry for me because I'm the only one really serving the lord I'm the only one working this hard my marriage is the only one my life is the only one my schedule is the only one my kids are the only one my situation is the only one nobody has it as bad as me no one has a schedule like I have no one has the financial situation I have I'm the only only one and you often see people like this they they post passive aggressive hashtags on their social media hashtag worked all day still broke #work work work #no one gets it and I'm in the pride of pity it has us blinding is wearing us out let me give you the next face of Pride that has us blinded it's wearing us out it's the pride of poor planning pride of poor planning prideful people can struggle with planning out their schedule they think that they can be successful without a plan that they can just fly by the seat of their pants but that's not what the Bible says Psalm 24 it says may he Grant your heart's desire and make all your plans succeed if you're trying to break free from busyness and desire to be more successful you need a plan when you don't have a plan you don't control your days they control you you're always reacting to life instead of leaving your life some of you you don't have a plan for tomorrow and you're just going to react to everything that hits your plate and comes your way and by the end of Monday you are going to be War slick out and then you always find yourself over committed because of a lack of planning and you can't see it because Pride it has you blinded let me give you another face of pride that we're blinded to that blinds us it deceives us it's the pride of power the pride of power it will drive you to control everything and everyone around you you're trying to control your kids and they're 35 years old you know you know what I'm saying you're trying to control your spouse your girlfriend your boyfriend your boss your employees you're trying to control your dog and your cat and the economy and gas prices and the stock market stop it you're not God you're not God you are wearing yourself out because of the pride of power let me give you another face of Pride that has us blinded that's the pride of perfectionism the pride of perfectionism perfectionism says I can't let up because I can't make a mistake or it says things are never good enough the house is never cleaning up the grass has never looks good enough the garage is never tidy enough the work project is never good enough the homework is never good enough and you're always so busy because of the pride of perfectionism and then lastly let me give you the last face of Pride as you deceived blinded wearing some of you out it's the pride of posting the pride of posting some of you you are wearing yourself out on social media oh yeah uh it always cracks me up where I see somebody in there doing this with their phone and I'm like I think maybe they're trying to get a signal but then I realized no they're trying to take a selfie trying to get the light just right trying to get the right side of their face and the right angle and you know duck lips or whatever whatever it is and take a couple picture look at it and then they're doing it again and it'll take them and I mean oh 15 minutes for one selfie 50 minutes of the pride of posting there can be Pride behind posting why am I posting why am I always on social media someone posts something and then you go and post something similar they post about their kids now you post about yours they post about their job success so then you go post about yours I'm telling you right now the pride of posting it will it will wear you out Pride will have a stumbling and fumbling we will not see clearly because we're brought blinded we will end up broken we'll end up breaking our life we'll end up wearing ourselves out because we cannot see the pride in our life and God again he doesn't want your life to be broken he wants your life to be blessed and so I want to give you three principles to penetrate the power of Pride well I hope you came ready to write some peas down today the three principles to penetrate the power of Pride number one is this you gotta humble yourself before God humble yourself before God humbling yourself before the Lord means fearing the Lord look what Proverbs 8 13 says all who fear the Lord will hate evil therefore I hate pride and arrogance corruption and perverse speech when we fear the lord we hate evil we hate the pride of life and the more you will fear the lord the more you will hate and recognize and see the pride of life the fear of the Lord it will help you recognize the pride in your own life as you fear God as you humble yourself before God God will show you which 11 faces you're struggling with whether it's one or two or all 11 God doesn't want Pride to lead to your destruction he does not want your life blinded busy and broken and so if you know the consequences of Pride it can help you recognize the 11 faces of pride in your life look what Proverbs 16 5 says it says the Lord detests all the proud of heart be sure of this they will not go unpunished there are always consequences for a heart that is full of Pride well what are some of the consequences look at Proverbs 11 2 it says when pride comes then comes shame some translations say disgrace you will experience shame and disgrace when you're full of Pride Proverbs 29 23 it says Pride ends in humiliation Pride will bring humiliation to your life prideful people they want to be brought high but instead they will be brought low Proverbs 13 10 it says where there is Strife there is pride pride brings Strife it brings tensions to your relationship your marriage your family your workplace your boss your parents your dating Proverbs 18 12. it says Before Destruction the heart of a man is haughty Pride brings destruction James 4 6. it says but he gives us more grace that is why the scripture says God oppose Moses the proud the Bible says God opposes the proud he resists the proud some of you you're literally experiencing God's resistance instead of his assistance because of your pride you're experiencing his resistance instead of his assistance Pride brings God's resistance first Peter 5 5 5 says it again God opposes the pride pride proud when you're full of Pride you're fighting against God and you're living with God's resistance instead of his assistance and so we have to humble yourself before God number two realize the benefits of humility when we humble ourselves before God we receive blessing after blessing after blessing we receive God's assistance not resistance look what James 4 6 says it says but he gives us more grace and that is why scripture says God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble when you humble yourself you'll start receiving God's assistance instead of his resistance you'll start to see God's favor his hand his touch on your life Proverbs 15 33 it says the fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility humility brings honor brings God's favor God will give you favor and honor with him and with people when you humble yourself you don't have to fight for honor and favor God will give it to you Proverbs 11 2 it says when Pride outcomes then comes shame but with the humble is wisdom when you humble yourself God gives you wisdom wisdom on how to get out of the busyness how to lead a better life how to overcome Pride how to get healthy but wisdom starts with humility first Peter 5 6 it says so humble yourselves under the mighty power of God and at the right time he will lift you up in honor God lifts people up who humble themselves prideful people are always trying to lift themselves up no no no be humble God will lift you up he'll lift you up out of busyness he'll lift you up out of unhealth he'll lift you out of Shame and out of your mess Luke 14 11 it says for those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted so many people are trying to exalt themselves up trying to elevate themselves but the key to being exalted isn't to fight to be exalted is to humble yourself and then God will exalt you Isaiah 66 2 it says my hands have made both Heaven and Earth they and everything in them are mine I the Lord have spoken I will bless those who have humble and contrite Hearts who tremble at my word God blesses those who humble themselves and then number three how to penetrate the power of Pride you have to humble yourself before people first Peter 5 5 in the same way you who are younger submit yourselves to your elders all of you everybody say all all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another because God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble if you don't humble yourself before people you really aren't humbling yourself before God you will experience God's resistance instead of his assistance let me give you some ways to identify if you're humbling yourself before people number one ask people around you how you're doing with pride ask them am I prideful secondly give people permission to point out pride in your life most prideful people will not allow people to speak into their pride they're defensive they have a false humility they're professional excuse makers be accountable to people invited and really let people hold you accountable don't be defensive or make excuses help other people win add value to others praise others give others compliment give them credit for the project forgive others admit you're wrong say you're sorry often come on follow leadership do what leadership asks you to do your boss your teacher your leader and finally serve others serve others listen we gotta we got to put on the apron when you put on an apron you are ready to serve and this is what God wants us to do this is what he created us to do you want to overcome Pride serve others put the apron on and don't take it off no matter the position you achieve in life the success you achieve the money you make the connections you have serve people we are servants Jesus said if you want to be the greatest in the kingdom of God be a servant come on you're not just an employee but a servant employee not just a boss but a servant boss not just a dad but a servant dad not a mom but a servant mom not just a leader but a servant leader not just a business leader but a servant business leader not just an entrepreneur but a servant entrepreneur see one of the reasons we encourage people we tell people listen servant on the Dream Team and leading a small group listen one of the reasons it's so key to your heart and your growth and growing in your relationship with God is because it puts you in a place it keeps you consistently serving others and that is a phenomenal way to stay humble see as we leave today we have the choice you gonna wear an apron or you're going to grab a menu menus are for ordering ready to tell people what you want menus let people know you're ready to be served if we continue to hold on to the menu we're going to continue to be blinded by Pride but if we'll put down the menu and we'll put on the apron humble ourselves before God humble ourselves before people God will lift you up he'll pick you up as you humble yourself I'm telling you he's going to help you see the faces of Pride he's going to open your eyes as we humble ourselves you're going to see the power of the Holy Spirit you're going to see God's lenses because you know what that's we are most like Jesus when we serve I want to be like Jesus serve somebody that's that's why we give that opportunity every single Sunday every Sunday we want to give you an opportunity if there's no other time in your week you're like Jesus man get on the Dream Team put on an apron and serve to make a difference to Humble ourselves before people and before God so that pride is not breaking us it's not leaving us broken it's not leaving to busyness that is Wrecking our life
c0xwIG-t4Yg,well tonight was a pretty big game if if you didn't know uh we have two teams playing for the super bowl the bengals and the rams i'm just curious in this 9 30 service how many of you are

bowl well would you be the 2006-2000 world champion indianapolis colts would you be a first place team or would you be the bad news bears the detroit lions would you be [Music] last place or just average do you feel like the team that's got momentum or do you feel like the team that's dysfunctional you feel like a team that's fumbling stumbling getting sacked over and over and over again fighting on the sidelines no communication at all everyone is doing their own thing as i've talked with many married couples some are frustrated some are coasting some are surviving communication has broken down or communication has become a bunch of yelling and screaming there's not a lot of touchdowns and celebration come on there's no gritty or i don't know how to do that that was my my there's no gritty it just feels like the grind the old ball and chain intimacy is struggling feel like maybe just two individuals in the same house maybe feel like roommates instead of soul mates and i want you to know that god wants your marriage thriving not surviving to feel like champions not chumps to be soul mates not roommates gods want you to rediscover your love instead of relegating to divorce to be winning not losing and great teams winning teams don't just happen overnight they don't happen by accident and it's the same with a great marriage a great marriage does not happen by accident it does not happen overnight great teams great marriages are made and how they condition prepare practice train it takes lots of work lots of hours and they have a winning plan and so we're going to look at a team in the bible today we're going to look at abraham and sarah and this is going to help your marriage or your future marriage be a winning team i want to help you to stop taking l's stop taking losses and get some touchdowns and start winning i want to i'm going to give you a winning game plan today each one of my points is actually going to spell the word team everybody say team so first point is this the the t in team stands for this how to have a winning marriage you have to turn up healthy communication and terminate trash talking turn up healthy communication and terminate trash talking look at genesis chapter 16 verse 1 and 2. sarah and abram had some communication issues it says now sarah abram's wife had borne him no children but she had an egyptian slave named hagar so she said to abram the lord has kept me from having children go sleep with my slave perhaps i can build a family through her huh and then the bible says abraham agreed to what sarah said abraham and said we're having some communication issues y'all first of all sarah should have never said that have you ever said something you didn't mean you know what i mean and like the person hearing it should have known that you didn't mean it like like i know she said it abraham's like she said it brother you were not supposed to agree you know what i mean you know what i mean it's like man i feel like i look fat in this outfit yeah you do no you don't no girl you look good hey come over here you looking good like there some of you they had some they had some communication issues y'all this was not healthy communication they should have sat down they should have got their minds right their hearts right they should have talked this through and if you know the story because abraham went ahead and and did what sarah said it led to all kinds of trash talking and arguments amongst them and with hagar and all kinds of drama see our communication determines whether we win or whether we lose amos chapter 3 verse 3 the bible says can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction see many marriages are struggling because communication is struggling y'all aren't talking so you aren't walking together you're walking in different directions and communication is key to every great team it's it's not just making time to talk but it's actively seeking to listen and understand your spouse we got to turn up the healthy communication and so i want to give you some plays to run some plays to run to turn up healthy communication first is this be intentional about spending time together be intentional about spending time together i came across this study this is a current study it says on average couples spend only 20 minutes a week talking with each other now talking so it doesn't include texting and well you know or whatever but technology ways of communicating or but actually talking with one another we got to turn off the technology and we got to make it a point to spend 20 to 30 minutes a day catching up with each other in football they have a huddle listen you got to have a daily huddle daily have some face to face eye to eye contact communication talking with your spouse in times in a football game teams need to call a time out listen go on a weekly date jamie and i this is our time out we go on a weekly day this is a time out for me and jamie no kids no work no family no friends just me and her face to face eye to eye for two hours or so or an hour and a half or sometimes it's longer and it normally is around some yummy food but you gotta you gotta take a time out football also has a bye week a bye week where there is no work they get a week off you got to take a vacation listen if you're going to have healthy communication you got to spend time together to be able to talk with one another all right and then once you make time for one another secondly the second thing is you got to develop your listening skills you got to develop your listening skills james 119 it says this you know my beloved brethren but everyone must be quick to hear slow to speak and slow to anger did you know that listen and silent are spelled with the same letters some of y'all are trying to picture it right now go ahead you can double check my english my grammar it is correct listen and silent are spelled with the same letters think about it for a marriage to succeed both spouses must be able to hear each other and listen to understand listen you have to avoid mind reading you ever seen a football game where you see the players arguing like you were supposed to go that way no i thought you wanted me to go down i gave you the look we mean what look i thought you were looking over there you know what i mean sometimes we're doing that with our spout i gave you like what look man i miss that look and you got to avoid mind mind reading is not going to going to lead to healthy communication you got to don't read minds you also you gotta turn off the crowd noise come on y'all remember peyton manning peyton manning in the rca dome had that place silent listen you gotta turn off the crowd noise you got to quiet the negative voices you got a quiet folks that are booing your marriage trying to trip you up trying to make you cause a turnover distracting voices trying to get you on their team you gotta you gotta turn off the crowd noise and so we gotta develop our listening skills and then thirdly how do we turn up healthy communication freely express positive feelings freely express positive feelings most people are quicker to express negative feelings than positive ones and it is vital to the health of your marriage that you affirm your spouse positive feelings such as appreciation affection respect admiration and approval are like making deposits into your love account be their biggest cheerleader come on compliment and celebrate and put wind in their cells use your voice and use your words to lift them up proverbs 16 24 it says kind words are like honey you know in football games when a team wins they give the the coach a gatorade bath listen you need to give your spout a honey bath all right bible says kind words are like honey like just keep pouring out the honey i know you're thinking some of y'all that you're like that's sticky in but just just the bible says kind word sweet to the soul healthy for the body come on you gotta put some honey on your honey because our communication it determines whether we win or lose so we got to turn up healthy communication and then we have to terminate trash talk proverbs 18 21 the bible says the tongue has the power of life and death listen we can't be speaking death into our marriage or our spouse let me let me give you some plays to run to terminate trash talk first is this use more i statements and less use statements more i statements and less use statements this decreases the chances of your spouse feeling like they need to defend themselves let me give you an example you statement you always leave your mess lying everywhere i statement i feel frustrated when i come home and the house is messy you statement you don't care about me or my feelings i statement i feel frustrated when my feelings aren't heard or acknowledged you statement you didn't text me like you said you would i statement i feel worried when i don't hear from you and i just want to know that you're okay and safe you statement you embarrassed me at dinner the other night like you always do i statement i felt really embarrassed the other night in front of our friends when this topic came up you statement you never tell me how you're feeling i statement i would love to know how you're feeling about this use more i statements less use statements secondly avoid generalizations all these get me you always all the time you never oh you want some trash talking oh you want to get it heated up in there oh you want to start bumping chests and all of a sudden going off on each other on the sideline oh start using some you always and all the time and you know you got to avoid generalizations thirdly express negative feelings constructively ephesians 4 29 do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen listen there will be times when you feel bitterness resentment disappointment or disapproval these feelings need to be communicated in order for change to occur but how you express these thoughts is critical it's one thing to say i am really disappointed that you're working late again tonight but if you say you clearly do not care one bit about me and our kids if you did you would not work late every night conveys something entirely different and we're going to have disagreements there's going to be conflict and and we just we got to be careful we got to express these feelings constructively tone matters our words matter body language matter you may need to take a personal time out you may need to uh you know in football now when someone gets injured they put them in the tent build a tent in your house i'm injured and wounded and i'm about i need to go into tent i need some time in the tent you may need to go in the tent calm yourself down so that you can then express negative feelings constructively we've got to learn how to do them constructively so the team we got to turn up healthy communication and we have to terminate uh trash talking the e in team the e in team is effort everybody say effort effort is what separates okay teams from extraordinary teams all great things require effort there is no magic wand or fairy dust for getting an extraordinary marriage it does not exist it takes effort effort is the fairy dust sprinkle a whole lot of effort and so i want to encourage you put effort in out serving one another not out selfishing each other serving takes effort selfish takes none serving is hard selfish is easy serving is win-win selfish is always lose lose and in genesis 20 abraham he lies about sarah being his sister and when he's addressed about this he says this he says because i thought surely that the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake this is selfish love he was willing to put his wife in harm's way in order to save himself bad marriages are driven by selfishness when a marriage is falling apart you can be sure that one or both people are focused on themselves selfishness is all about me great god-honoring marriages happen because both the men and the women they focus on meeting each other's needs in first corinthians chapter 7 verse 33-34 it says but a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife his interests are divided in the same way a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the lord and wholly in body and spirit but a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband in a great marriage the husband is focused on meeting his wife's needs and the wife is focused on meeting her husbands philippians 2 4 it says each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interest of others you have to look to the interests of your spouse and that takes effort it takes effort because you got to learn your spouse learning your spouse it takes effort what are your spouse's needs and interests what makes your spouse happy to meet your spouse's needs you first have to know what they are there's a great book called the five love languages by gary chapman put in some effort learn your spouse's love language it has five of them words of affirmation is one their love language is encouraging and kind words words are important to them for some it's quality time undivided focused attention quality conversation where you share feelings desires and dreams for others it's it's receiving gifts come on bought within a budget amen all right you don't want to get too crazy with that one but at times they can be handmade or free but gifts is their long-willed language for others it's acts of service for others it's it's physical touch and listen the reality is is your spouse's love language is probably very different than yours and so you got to learn it you got to put in effort and listen their love language at 22 is probably different than their love language now at four jamie i think her love language changes every year y'all i'm just i'm just i've got to start asking she's had all five so i mean it has there was at times where it was words and there's quality time chris i want your face look at me i'm like man we're sitting together on the couch watching the game that is not quality time to me that's quality time that is not quality time you got to put in some effort you got to learn something like we're talking about we just sat three hours through a football game she was like how about you come spend three hours in this kitchen and make some cupcakes with me or something but you you gotta learn you gotta learn it takes effort you gotta learn their love languages all right keep your spouse's love tank full it takes effort marriage is like a car if you're going to run smoothly you must keep gas in the tank i ran out of gas this was maybe like a year or two ago ran out of gas the credits so we were actually on german church road ran out of gas and kids are in the car like dad what happened i'm like we ran out of gas and they're like huh they were confused because y'all i stopped at the gas station what's so crazy is i stopped at the gas station i went in i paid the clerk i walked back out got in my car and drove off i'm like why is my car running out of gas i was just at the gas station and some of y'all you don't even realize it but your spouse's tank is empty because you're so distracted i was distracted you were so distracted by so many other things you may be distracted by pain you may be distracted by people you may be distracted by your job that you think you're good and you think it's great and you're like i just pulled over to the gas station i am good and next thing you know you find yourself on the side of the road out of gas great marriages keep gas in the tank both spouses love tanks stay full and you have to work hard to keep your spouse's love tank full it takes effort come on everybody say effort and listen sometimes you got to get a trainer sometimes you're not putting enough effort and so you need some help all right if the they got strength and conditioning coaches in in in sports to help them get stronger so that they can give more effort if you are lacking and you are struggling in your marriage get a trainer get get in a marriage small group a matter of fact we got like two or three new marriage small groups that leaders just signed up for stop by our small group table get yourself in a marriage small group sometimes you got to get in counseling all right jamie and i we were we tried we were trying to figure stuff out and we just kept failing over and over again and so we had to get a trainer sometimes when you're trying to work out and lose weight you just can't do it on your own you got to get a trainer listen sometimes in your marriage you can't do it on your own you need to get a trainer go get some good christian counseling it will help you get stronger so the e is effort now let's go to the a in team the a in team is this an all-in mentality an all-in mentality you have to have an all-in mentality and you have to take the word quit out of your vocabulary you're gonna be a winning team winning marriage quit cannot be in your vocabulary thomas edison said this one of the greatest weaknesses lies in giving up the most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time you have to be committed all in during good times and bad times abraham and sarah they went through a lot of bad times but they were all in they stayed committed if you read through their story genesis 12 4 there was confusion they were leaving their land they didn't know where they were going but they were all in they stayed committed genesis 12 10 they had financial issues they went through a famine but they were all in they stayed committed in genesis 12 through 13 there were integrity issues abraham told sarah to lie and say that she was his sister because she was beautiful and it caused some issues but they were all in and they stayed committed in genesis 12 19 there was unfaithfulness pharaoh took sarah ferret pharaoh took sarah as his wife but they were all in and stayed committed in genesis 16 1 they were family and faith issues sarah couldn't get pregnant and and god had promised them a child but they were all in and stayed committed in genesis 16 verse 1 through 4 there was unfaithful issues again abraham slept with hagar because sarah couldn't get pregnant but they were all in and stay committed in genesis 16 verse 4 through 6 there was resentment hagar was upset at sarah and sarah was upset with abraham but they were all in and they stayed committed in genesis 16 16 they're waiting they're frustrated abraham's 86 years old when ishmael was born 14 years long years went by still waiting for a birth of a son it was challenging it was hard i'm sure with some bad times but they were all in and stay committed abraham and sarah stayed committed to the marriage in spite of all the bad times and god blessed them because of their commitment genesis 21 verse 1 through 2 it says now the lord was gracious to sarah as he had said and the lord did for sarah what he had promised sarah became pregnant and bore a son to abraham in his old age at the very time god had promised him in genesis 21 verse 5 through 7 it says abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born to him sarah said god has brought me laughter and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me and she added who would have said to abraham that sarah would nurse children yet i have borne him a son in his old age god blessed abraham and sarah because they stayed committed it wasn't easy it was hard they went through some extremely challenging challenging times but they were all in on the good times and the bad times galatians 6 9 it says let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap and harvest if we do not give up listen marriage isn't easy there will be difficult seasons there will be challenges but the great marriages they stay committed they are all in come on everybody say all in they last the test of time say all in like abraham and sarah you may be dealing with confusion financial issues integrity unfaithfulness there may be family struggles faith resentment waiting on god frustration stay committed be all in don't grow weary in doing good even through the difficult seasons because you will reap a harvest in your marriage if you do not give up listen god can turn all mistakes into a miracle god can tell turn ashes into beauty but we have to be all in god wants you to have a winning team a winning marriage you got to turn up healthy communication you got to terminate trash talk it's going to take effort you've got to have an all-in mentality and then number four the m is make god the center of your marriage if you aren't very familiar with football the play starts with the ball in the center's hands the center is normally the big guy that gets down and he has the ball and he hikes it to the quarterback but every single play starts in the centers hand listen if you are going to win in your marriage the ball has to start in god's hands it's got to start in god's hands put the ball in god's hands don't start anything without god see one of the keys to abraham and sarah staying together during the good and bad times was their faith in god through all of their sin mistakes and frustrations they never lost their faith in god all throughout the bible it talks about abraham and sarah's faith and relationship with god and i believe one of the major keys of abraham and sarah's marriage making it for the long haul was their commitment to god they said god threw it all through the challenges through the unfaithfulness through the pain through the hurt god we're putting the ball in your hands god we're gonna run your place the plays we're running are love patience forgiveness kindness keeping no records of wrongs never giving up god we are running your plays let me show you a winning play for your marriage it's called the marriage triangle this is a winning play see oftentimes a husband and a wife they could be far apart we're different we have issues we make mistakes we hurt one another it's very easy for marriages a husband and a wife start to have distance and the best thing you can do to get closeness is to get closer to god if each one of you [Music] you'll get closer to god pastor i'm praying i get it some of you are praying and god's heard your prayers but he's saying hey i've given you some really clear plays in my word to run and you're not running them you're i hear you praying you're doing like aaron rodgers and peyton manning said they do the coach is giving them a play they don't like they're like god can't hear something going on and they're just running their own place i'm telling you right now and it's a journey and it takes time and it's a process and jaime and i in our struggles in the moments where our marriage got really bad [Music] the word divorce was spoken [Music] we knew the one thing we needed to do was we need to get closer to god than ever before we need to run his plays even if we didn't feel like running his place we need to listen to his word and follow his word we need to listen to the godly counsel that he put in our life we need to go find a christian counselor that was going to help us get closer to god so that we could get closer to one another i'm telling you god has a winning play now again you both got to run it right you both got to run it but all you can control is you you run the play you run god's play you know what oftentimes i found i found if one will start to run god's play the other starts to follow doesn't always work out that way but i just know i need god i know god is the one that takes mistakes and turns them into miracles you know on the divorce form you see uh the thing i see all the time or you hear about in the news is unreconcilable differences i thank god that he is a reconcilable god he is a resurrecting god that there is no difference that he can reconcile and heal i'm not saying it's not easy it's tough it is challenging but he is a resurrecting god he with him all things are possible but you got to run his place over it's not gonna make sense it's gonna be tough you're gonna have people trying to tackle you you can have some fourth and ones you may have to punt a couple times but you're like god i'm gonna keep running your play whatever your word says that's what i'm gonna do i'm not gonna ignore it i'm gonna follow it i'm gonna be on fire for you i'm telling you husbands the greatest thing you can do for your marriage is you get on fire for jesus you get on your knees with weeping and gnashing of teeth and crying out and begging to the lord for his intervention and for his spirit and for his power to move in your life and your marriage for him to completely change you why is the greatest thing you can do for your marriage is get closer to god than ever before to cry out to pray to seek his face i'm telling you running god's place gonna help you have a winning marriage and that's what god created you to have a winning thriving celebrating touchdown chest bump due to gritty or whatever dance you want to do in the end zone together in your own house like that's what god created for you and i get it the world is coming and attacking and trying to sack you but you got to remember with god on your side all things are possible all things are possible
lNYUFJ3FFEY,well good morning and I'm gonna have you do that again here in a moment but I'm the lead Pastor here at uh People's Church our Indianapolis campus and today is you take over we have students taking over serving in the parking lot greeting ushing ushering they're in the production they're serving singing doing announcements and back in the kids ministry and come on happy I know the next generation is our future and we gotta we got a bright future come on God's doing amazing work in our students and their hearts and lives and we're excited to see what the Lord is going to do I do want to piggyback off what Pastor Herbert said we have specific projects here in Indianapolis for serve day and so make sure you go on the App if you want to lead a project you can submit that but we already got projects on there that you can be a part of projects with schools there's a back to school Outreach there's uh projects to help the homeless Minister downtown so there's a lot of projects on there go on there go on the App sign up serve days in two weeks and we can't wait to make an impact in our city right here in Indianapolis so without further Ado I want to introduce our youth pastor him and his wife Jess have just been doing a tremendous job leading Our Youth Ministry they just got back from camp and they're here the students are serving and he's going to be preaching so y'all would y'all please give it up for pastor Andrew as he brings the word today come on people's Church keep those hands going for Jesus today come on if you love Jesus would you give him some praise today oh come on that's good for the Colts and it's good for the Pacers but come on can we give Jesus a hand clap of praise amen amen well thank you Pastor Chris for the the kind introduction as he was saying my wife Jess and I uh we're just honored to not only serve People's Church but to serve the Next Generation here in our community been a part of people's church now for almost four years and in fact last month marked two years serving on staff here as our student pastor and it's it's a privilege and an honor to be able to invest in the lives of so many students and you know days like today youth takeover Sunday where you get to see young people on the front lines leading serving and doing Ministry it's special but can I tell you what I love about People's Church is that it's not a foreign or A New Concept for students to be leading and serving if you know what I'm talking about because every Sunday and every Wednesday we already have students leading in various capacities here in our church serving in First Impressions and PC kids in our on our our events team and serving on Wednesday nights you know with greeting and ushering and checking and helping us with our social media because we believe that this generation has been called by God to make a difference right now amen the Bible says in Proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 that if you will direct your children onto the right path that then when they are older they will not walk away from it they will not leave out how many of you believe that what the Bible says is true that if you train up a child if you direct your student onto the right path on the God's path that when they are older when they are mature when they are independent they will not leave it and here at People's Church we want to be intentional with our students we want to set them up to win in life with clear principles and directions you know this past Friday as you just heard our students return from a powerful week at summer camp all and here at our Indy campus all 46 made it back in one piece safe and sound and filled with the holy spirit amen I uh I arrived at camp and got told hey Pastor Andrew you're the team captain for these three churches this week I'm like okay cool what does that mean they're like you got to be the rah-rah hype man all week and I said yo I got a preach on Sunday the last thing I got to do is lose my voice so you know the Bible says that pastors exist to equip the Saints to do the work of the ministry so I took a megaphone handed it to one of my youth leaders and said congratulations you are the rah-rah hype man for this week because your boy got to preach on Sunday so my team took the brunt of it thank God but what's awesome is that across all of our locations that people searched we saw 242 students and youth leaders combined attend summer camp this past week where God did come on we can give God praise for that 242 lives were changed we saw students dedicate and rededicate their life to Jesus experience physical healing in their body be set free from generational curses it was a powerful fun in life changing week our students had fun made life-giving relationships that will last a lifetime and what's also awesome is God has done so much more this summer at our church and in our next gen than just what we've seen at summer camp this summer we did another summer internship uh with our youth ministry for high school students and students who have graduated going into college and across all of our campuses we have over 50 interns serving here four days a week y'all they're getting up early they're coming in here that's awesome yeah we can praise God for that going through leadership development discipleship their leading teams serving and making a difference because we believe that God's word is always the win and so here at people search that's why we are committed to creating space for all of our students to grow to be developed because we don't believe that they're just supposed to sit on the sidelines until they turn 18. we believe that if the enemy has a plan and a purpose for them now that God also has a plan and a purpose for them now and it is our responsibility it's our conviction and our calling as a church as pastors and as Leaders to acquit them and prepare them to be used by God to make a difference here and now in their life because the Bible says again in Proverbs 22 6 that if you will direct your children onto the right path that when they were they are older they will not leave it and so I want to take this opportunity before we dive into the word of God today to say thank you People's Church because many of you were generous and gave money for Camp scholarships to provide students who financially couldn't afford 100 of the cost to go to camp this year and it's because of your generosity they got to be in the presence of God and experience breakthrough and they were walking away from a week of Camp never going to be the same because they've forever been marked and touched by God so thank you for your generosity and I also want to thank all of our adult volunteers who leave work on Wednesday nights and come straight to Epic for Wednesday night youth service some of them still wearing wearing their work clothes sacrificing their time and their energy and with their family least so many things because they believe in the Next Generation and they believe in God's purpose in his future for them and then lastly I want to thank every single parent that beliefs and what we're doing here at people searching investing in the Next Generation thank you for making God's house a priority and a conviction for your family because it makes a difference every time the church doors were open growing up man even when my parents were in a Ministry anymore they said hey if the doors are open we're going to be there no matter what we were all athletes we all performed in musical arts but they said nope not on Sundays not on Wednesdays you're going to be in God's house and can I tell you man it made a difference in my life and I'll never be the same because of it and so parents families grandmas grandpas thank you thank you thank you for allowing us to partner with you so that we can invest in your students and help them become lifelong committed followers of Jesus Christ we want you to know it's your belief it's your investment it's your generosity in the Next Generation that is making a difference and that will continue to impact future generations to come amen all right well the title of my message today that I want to preach to you is this let's go fishing let's go fishing I said I said that and some of you are like all right Pastor let's do it when and where I'm ready and then some of you are like oh fishing I would rather watch paint dry on the wall than go fishing you see I'm sure I'm not sure how many people in the room today love to go fishing for fun but according to research data did you know that over 46 million people a year engaged in fishing for fun some of you are like really I'm not one of those 46 million people and if I'm being honest with you today I am also not one of those 46 million people I am a city boy uh in every single way I was born in the city raised in this city I am still in the city so I will not get up here and pretend like I'm a country boy if you put a fishing pole and my hand has had dinner's on you tonight yo I'm just saying we would be in some big trouble but today I do want to talk about what the Bible has to say specifically about fishing I don't know a lot about fishing personally but what I do know is it requires a lot of hard work and it requires a lot of patience a lot like doing Ministry for the Next Generation in order to be good at it it requires diligence and dedication and that brings me to the biblical text I want to draw your attention to today in Matthew chapter four you can turn on your Bible if you're a teenager if you're a parent if you're older than 25 then you can open up your Bible to Matthew chapter four if I was preaching an epic I would say turn on your Bible and if you don't have a phone or a tablet you can follow along with me on the screen in Matthew chapter four you see when we look at scripture we see that many people follow Jesus throughout his Earthly Ministry but there were 12 specific individuals that were considered to be his disciples three of them being his close disciples but in Matthew chapter 4 we encounter how Jesus called his first four disciples to do life and Ministry with him and these four individuals were actually fishermen by trade and so Matthew's gospel in chapter four it relays the account of Jesus calling them to Ministry in Matthew chapter four so let's read it together I'll be reading from reading this passage from the message translation here's what the Bible says walking along the beach of Lake Galilee Jesus saw two brothers Simon later called Peter and Andrew they were fishing throwing their Nets into the lake it was their regular work and Jesus said to them come with me I'll make a new kind of fisherman out of you he goes on to say I'll show you how to catch men and women instead of perch and bass and I love this part it says they didn't ask questions but simply dropped their Nets and followed how many you know God doesn't need our understanding to do what he's called us to do he just needs our obedience amen the Bible says a short distance down the beach They Came Upon another pair of brothers James and John Zebedee Sons these two were sitting in a boat with their father's Deputy mending their fishnets and Jesus made the same offer to them and they were just as quick to follow abandoning boats and father you know what's fascinating I actually didn't know this until I started doing some study and preparing for this message but according to most historical accounts Jesus's disciples were all almost between the ages of 13 years old and 30 years old because in Jewish culture it was at that age that Jewish boys Jewish young men would be selected by rabbis and teachers to follow them and to be considered their disciples and upon learning this it finally made sense to me why in scripture we see Jesus had some of the conversations that he had with his disciples right some of us have been there where we've read the Bible and we're like how many times does Jesus have to tell them this to explain it to them or to get it to or get it through their mind most of the time it seemed like it went one ear and out the other any parent in here with teenagers or young kids knows exactly what I'm talking about because you imagine Jesus yelling out here they're saying Pierre put the Sword Down leave Andrew alone I could see Jesus looking at looking at Matthew or looking at Judas and saying you spend our money on how many energy drinks why we got plenty of bread and water bro you don't need none of that the last thing you need is more caffeine it's in the Bible somewhere I can't find it but I you know I could see Jesus you know walking into the place where they're staying being like y'all okay who left their sandals out again I could see Jesus looking at one of these younger disciples and telling them to get off their tablet and pay attention are you guys even listening as he's trying to explain his Parables and his teachings to them over and over and over again but in all seriousness you see Jesus was fully and Faithfully committed to investing in the next generation of his day and we see the evidence of that because of who he surrounded himself with the twelve he chose to follow him and so Jesus used the analogy of making Peter Andrew James and John Fishers of men and women because it would have been relatable to them since fishing was what they understood and did best the Bible says that's what they did for a living and what I love is that Jesus was going to cast a net of Hope of help and healing for all of humanity through his life and he chose to use young people to help him lead and accomplish his efficient however Jesus wasn't going to be the only one fishing for people in the waters of life because the Bible tells us that we have the same enemy that Jesus and his followers did the devil the Bible says our our enemy our adversary is Satan he was busy then and guess what he's still busy now from the beginning of time he has never stopped fishing for the hearts and minds of people and especially our students anyone who will take the bait he offers full of deceptions and lies because again y'all I don't know about much about fishing I'm a city boy but the couple of times I have been fishing in my life I've learned that one of the most important things about fishing is the bait that you use you see the bait has to be attractive and desirable for the fish the hook is invisible and it's intentionally designed to capture and to trap the fish in the process of catching the fish for those of you who have been fishing or you're like I am an expert compared to you right now would understand that you put the bait in the face of the fish hoping trying to lure them to bite it and to take the bait and if that fish ends up resisting the Temptation the first time then you what any good fisherman would do is continue to change the bait on the hook as many times as as possible until the fish bites before giving up and can I tell you the enemy is going to change the bait As Time continues to progress as generation follows generation the enemy is not going to give up changing his bait his hook to reach this current generation you see once you have the fish on the line you begin reeling them in and you begin to reel them away from their home and begin to reel them away from their future you begin to reel them away from their family from their friends and from their freedom and cannot tell you that this generation has an incredible challenge in front of them because their world and their culture is full of so many hooks covered with all sorts of bait that the devil has specially crafted and intentionally designed to bring harm in the cause of Destruction in their lives Satan is working hard to capture this generation at an early age because if he does he can disrupt and he can destroy them and he can prevent them from reaching their god-given potential you know many would consider this generation of students or young people from ages 11 to 26 as Generation Z we call them gen Z and there's some statistics about gen Z I want to share with you this morning in the first one two out of every three young people in Generation Z are currently leaving the church or have already left the church that means if you brought three kids with you to church this morning that only one of them will still be in church when they turn 18 and graduate high school gen Z is also twice as likely than any other of the previous generations to become an atheist and denounce their faith and their belief in God only three percent of Generation Z is reading their Bible three percent not even one out of every ten people in gen Z is reading their Bible but did you also know that the average 10 teenager spends almost seven and a half hours a day on a phone or mobile device and what's crazy is that students between the ages of 8 to 12 spend just under five hours a day on their devices a U.S study performed in 2019 before the kova 19 pandemic started asked teenagers about their experience in the past 90 days and I want you to listen to these statistics 74 of these teenagers in the survey said that they experience loneliness 66 percent said they experienced high anxiety 60 percent said they experienced depression and 35 percent reported suicidal ideation and this tells me that the issues that this generation is facing are real and that they need a real God to show up and move in their lives and you know the truth is that the enemy has hooks in the water and he's after our students but what's also true and I believe today is that Jesus Christ is still the hope the help and the healing for this generation hope for the helpless that he has healing for the hurting in this generation and we want you to know here at People's Church as pastors as leaders and as a youth ministry we recognize we prayerfully recognize the hooks of the enemy that they're real trying to reach our students and that's why we use God's word as our guide to help students get free and to stay free because the Bible tells us that where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom that there is spiritual Freedom found in the presence of God and I want you to know that's why every Wednesday night these doors are open at 6 30 PM for students to come and encounter the presence of God that's why sometimes we do big events and have pizza and giveaways because we believe that freedom is found in the presence of God that's why we take kids to Camp every summer it's why we do epic youth takeover Sunday every year it's why we have student internships every Sunday or every summer it's why our adult youth leaders come straight from work to youth service on Wednesday night because we believe that lives are changed in the presence of God and that this generation is destined to lead the way and to experience Revival like never before can I tell you if there's a hook that I want to get a hold of our students it's the power of the Gospel if there's a hook I want to get hold of our students and never let them go it's the presence of almighty God we want our students to get caught by the power in the presence of the gospel and we want to release them back into a world filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and that's why we are casting a net of Hope into these seats every Wednesday night at Epic youth because God wants to capture the heart of every student to bring his help to bring his hope and to bring his healing into their lives and so for the next couple moments I just want to share with you why as a church why as followers of Jesus we must remain committed to reaching and investing in the Next Generation because we all have a part to play because the enemy's hooks are real and we want to see this generation set free from the enemy's Hooks and to stay free from the enemy's hooks so the first reason I want to give you today is this number one is because hooks drain hope it's because hooks strain hope you see when you go fishing one of the most important things you have to do whenever you finally get one on the line is you have to fight to reel it in because if anyone's been fishing you know as soon as you get a fish on the line the fish is not just going to let you reel it in the fish is going to literally do everything it can within its power and its ability to fight for its life it'll try to get away from its bad decision it'll try to shake free from the wrong choice it'll even jump out of the water the very thing it needs for life to try to get free from the hook and whenever this happens and the fish finally begins to realize there's nothing that it can do within its own ability and its own power to get free you know what the fish does it gives up and it gives in and you know I believe the same is true for this generation many of our middle school and high school students are encountering the hooks of the enemy there are hooks the enemy is using on this generation that are real and they're meant to bring harm and destruction and right now our students are in a battle some of them are being tempted to make decisions that may not cost them now but will cost them their future there are some of them that are being tempted with hooks some of them have already made bad decisions that have left them broken and bound and they are fighting on their own trying to break free and can I tell you that is exactly why God has called every single one of us to reach the next Generation in some way to disciple the Next Generation and to make disciples because they're not just the future of our world they're the future of the church because we have teenagers who are fighting against the enemy's hook hooks these hooks that have been designed to keep them in bondage and to experience them from walking and freedom every moment every day of their life some of our students are struggling with the hook of comparison that constantly tells them they're not enough some of them are struggling with the hook of compromise telling them you can only do it just this once and it'll be fine some of them are struggling with the hook of culture telling them that there is no absolute truth and that you get to choose your truth some of them are struggling with the hook of condemnation telling them that they're not good enough and they'll never measure measure up why anyone would ever love them that they have no hope they have no purpose some of them are struggling with the hook of confusion that tells them lies about their true identity listen you know it's easy to feel discouraged and defeated when you read these staggering and sobering statistics today that this generation struggles with hopelessness more than any other generation in our history but I'm reminded of what the Apostle Paul wrote to the church in Romans chapter 15 verse 13. he says I pray that God the source of Hope will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit listen I want you to understand today that whatever hope the enemy has taken from our students with his hooks the Bible clearly tells us that God desires to pour out his Spirit upon every boy every girl every man every woman because when they get filled with the Holy Spirit they get filled with his hope and if you know anything about biblical true biblical hope is that hope is able to restore what the enemy has taken and stolen from our students it's able to restore and to replenish what has been robbed of them and when I cannot tell you this when I look at scripture it tells me that when God restores something he doesn't just replace it how many you know sometimes you can break something and just because you replace it doesn't mean the replacement is better than what you had but the Bible says that when God restores something he makes it better than it was before and if God our students can get a hold of the presence of God and get filled with the Holy Spirit and be filled with the hope of the Gospel man they can be restored more than they ever have been before you see today I want you to understand that hooks are dangerous and that hooks drain hope and if we can keep our students away from the hooks of the enemy and we can get them filled with the hope of the Gospel with the hope of God's word that they're loved that they're called that they're chosen by God that they have a purpose to serve this generation man they will be filled with hope and they will be the the Future Leaders of our church and of our world a second thought I want to give you is this why we need to keep our students away from the hooks of the Enemy Number Two it's because hooks cause scars hooks cause scars I told y'all earlier today I didn't go fishing a lot I've never been fishing a lot but I'll never forget my first time fishing as a little kid I remember one of the fish I caught I pull it up I begin to look at it right because I'm fascinated it's my first time fishing as I looked at this hook at this fish I noticed like its mouth was all messed up and jacked up and I'm like I look over at uh I look over at the mint I'm fishing with and I'm like what is wrong with this fish I just caught and they said buddy you just caught a fish that somebody else caught before you did I'm like how do you know that and they said because when you catch a fish and you notice that it's scarred around its mouth that's from previous hooks that have latched onto it that means somebody else got to it first before you did how many you know the pain from the experience is avoidable if a fish could recognize the hook before it takes the bait because obviously if you go fishing with a hook and no bait you're not going to catch very many fish because no student no teenager would look at a hook from the enemy without bait and say yeah I want to mess up my life yeah I want to throw my future away yeah I want to compromise God's purpose for my life for my future family for my future marriage because if we saw the hook for what it was we would run from it but the Bible says that Satan is uh Satan is our enemy and our adversary who's disguised himself as an angel of Light knowing what bait to use to get this generation and the truth is that all of us can look back on some decisions we've made in our life that didn't seem bad 30 seconds before we made the decision and then afterwards they typically led to shame they led to regret and some of us still have the scars marked in our hearts and on our lives to prove it you see the hooks that the enemy dangles in front of our students have a specific purpose to leave scars on this generation scars to kill their future scars to steal their purpose and scars to destroy God's plan for their life John chapter 10 verse 10 it says that the thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy but Jesus said my purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life you see all that we do in our student Ministry is targeted to helping our students make daily decisions to arrive at God's plan to arrive at God's destination for each of their lives our sermons are intentionally crafted to design or to set them up to win at life we have small groups we call them circles every Wednesday night that serve to put them in an environment to engage in biblical Community by connecting and doing life with leaders and other students we do summer camp to pull them away from their normal Rhythm their normal routine of life so that they can hear God's voice clearly and experience his presence freely in fact this last week at Camp what's awesome is that God met with so many of our students and honestly that's what I let there was a time in my life where I told God God I'll do anything you ask me to do except youth ministry and now there's nothing else I'd rather do with my life I love having fun with our students it was great at camp we are playing this game where you have to run into the middle of this field and you have to pull these random objects back to your team it's like a train wreck literally it's awesome and uh the person emceeing the game the referee goes all right we're going to do a Leader's round with seniors and all the students look at me and go Pastor Andrew shave your beard and go out there and tell them you're an eighth grader and I'm like I love it I'm like I'm 24. I'm still young I can do this I'm like I'm gonna do everything within my power to go hard for these games because these kids are chanting my name and I'm like man I'm gonna give the people what they want you know what I'm saying I love those moments but can I tell you the best moments about Youth Camp every year the best moments about services on Wednesday nights some of the best moments of my life have been the testimonies and the stories of lives that are changed and I want to share some with you today one of our freshman boys after Camp said I rededicated my life to Christ at camp this year and God helped me to worship him better and find him in ways that I never thought I would be able to another high school student said I grew in my relationship with Jesus and this year at summer camp it was the first time in my life I ever became bold enough to finally pray for somebody else out loud one of our young ladies in high school said at summer camp God helped me to feel more love than I ever imagined I learned that I need to be patient by not just pursuing the gifts of the holy spirit but by pursuing a relationship with the Holy Spirit another young lady in high school said I drew closer to God than he drew closer to me like he said he would I'm stronger and more confident in my relationship with Jesus and now I'm ready to go home and start investing more time in my relationship with him one of our seniors said this year at Camp was the first time I ever truly felt God's presence with me and I grew in my relationship with Jesus this year more than I ever have in my entire life church family these are just a handful of stories specifically from our campus students who went to Camp here in Indianapolis students who attend here every Wednesday night God moving in their life experiencing breakthrough encountering him in ways and doing things they've never done before why because they've been equipped and empowered by the Holy Spirit and as a church can I just there's a conviction in my heart to share with you today we cannot allow the devil to become more passionate more intentional and more strategic than we are as a church at reaching the Next Generation because he is working overtime day afternoon evening and night to Captivate this generation but we have to commit ourselves to help keep our students from the hooks of the enemy that leave scars and we have to plug them into God's house to hear God's word and to learn God's ways you see the enemy is Relentless at putting hooks in front of our students to cause harm but today I want to invite each of you would you go fishing with us as a church and as a student Ministry well Pastor what are you asking me to do see I believe all of us have a part to play and there's some way God is calling each of us to partner in reaching the Next Generation so that they can encounter a God who loves them a God who created and designed them with the purpose a God who has good plans a hope and a future for them so before we pray and close this morning I want to give you three ways you can invest in the Next Generation the first thing you could do number one one of the most important things you do if not the most important thing you can do is pray for this generation you can pray for this generation can I tell you everything is more spiritual than you realize you think you're dealing with an attitude with laziness with bad grades no it's more spiritual than you realize and the battle is one in prayer you have to fight spiritual battles with spiritual weapons and as a church and as followers of Jesus we have to respond to the battle by fighting with our knees in prayer because the Bible says that the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective and it produces good results that's why we have to commit as a church to covering our students with prayer every day one of my favorite preachers Billy Graham once said to get a nation back on its feet we must first Get Down On Our Knees will you partner with us in praying for this generation and number two the second thing you can do prioritize church with your kids and your grandkids this is biblical you're like well of course you're the youth pastor you would tell me to bring my kids to your youth service on Wednesday night no you see I don't want something from you your kids or your family but I believe God has something for you your kids and your family the Bible says in Psalm chapter 92 verse 13 planted in the house of the Lord they will flourish in the courts of our God and I believe so many of our teenagers and our families are struggling today because we're not planted in God's house can I tell you if you send your student to a sports camp and you invest time money and energy into that you're going to get a better athlete you're going to get a better sports player I believe if you spit send your student to a band camp or a music camp they're going to become a better musician a better singer but I also believe that if you invest in your child by sending them to Camp every Sunday or every summer by making sure they're in God's house every Sunday and every Wednesday night I believe you're going to get a better leader you're going to get a better follower of Jesus you're going to get a better son or a daughter listen because the Bible says planted in the house of the Lord they will flourish in the courts of our God and can I tell you there is nobody who wants to see your florish more than our heavenly father we can trust the promises of God's word we want our students to flourish and produce fruit but you can't have fruit if you don't have roots to be rooted you have to be planted and for this to happen some of us need to prioritize and re-prioritize our lives we have to make Church God's house a priority on Sunday and youth a priority on Wednesday night and then lastly number three you can participate in reaching the Next Generation listen can I tell you this generation needs a multi-generational voice investing in them now more than ever before there are some of you who think I'm too young I'm too inexperienced I'm too old I'm not qualified to serve students to to serve teenagers listen some of you God has called you to serve this generation with your voice and your influence could help them avoid some of the hooks and their future that you've already been hooked on in your past God can use your voice can I tell you if you're available on Wednesday nights if you're willing to invest and you have a heart to love students where they are just as they are I want to connect with you today my team wants to connect with you today we have a bistro table out in the lobby plugged into our youth ministry or you're interested about how you can be involved with our youth ministry on Wednesday nights would you stop by our table out in the lobby we love to connect with you we have information there for you for you if you believe that the holy spirit is speaking you today telling you that now is the time today is today to get off the sideline and to get in the game and to win this next Generation man what better way to do that than to respond to this message because the Bible says that it'll do you no good if you hear God's word and do nothing about it but the blessing comes in the doing some of us today we need to respond by praying for our students some of us man we can partner by giving rights by making sure our students are plugged into God's house every week and then some of us man we can get on a dream team we can give up one night a week we can give up three hours a week because we believe in God's hope God's plan God's future for this generation see today I want to invite you to help us cast the net of Hope the net of help the head of the net of healing into the Waters of just this generation because we want them to be caught up in the love of God and then released full of his purpose full of his power and full of his spirit maybe you're here today and you've experienced in your life some of those hooks that we've been talking about today maybe you have scars and regrets that always remind you of the mistakes you've made and how you've constantly done nothing but fall short just like Jesus said in John chapter 10 he came to give you life and life to the full another translation says an abundant life this morning you have an opportunity to surrender your life to Jesus so he can bring the hope the help and the healing that you need so today here's what I want us to do if I could ask everyone to please bow their heads and close their eyes
24OihgFdKkM,today we're starting off this brand new series called stay in your lane preparing for your purpose stay in your lane preparing for your purpose and I I want to talk to you on the simple thought of trust God trust God um I uh over spring break our family went to Florida we went to uh clear water for my sister's wedding and it is a 15 hour drive that's a long drive I'm like sis you sure you don't want to get married near the Panhandle you know what I mean you want want to go up a but she wanted clear water so we drove 15 hours and when we go on road trips I'm the driver how many of you you're the driver you're like if we're going on a road trip you are the driver that that's what I am but my speed is like you know 4 hours or 7 to eight that's kind of like my Max that I'd like to go 7 to eight but this was 15 hours and so we're we're driving and uh my my wife Jamie is like babe I can totally Drive some of this how many of you like me you have a hard time giving up the steering wheel you know what I mean like you just got you got some I got some control issues Lord help me but it's 15 hours so I'm like okay I'll let you drive and I'll be honest with you this has caused some tension in our marriage previously so I'm like okay Chris it's it's okay we're just driving let her drive don't look but y'all I'm just I just couldn't help it I'm like the curb the curb hey you get a little too close to the curb hey you see that car why you swerving she's like Chris you trust me to drive our kids every day all over the city of Indianapolis you need to relax I'm like but I don't know if I trust you right now 75 miles an hour and yeah it was it did it got a little ugly there and it was all me it is all me I have trust issues I have some trust issues when it comes to letting somebody else drive and a lot of people have trust issues here's the definition of trust trust is a firm belief in the reliability truth ability or strength of someone or some something and a lot of people don't have a firm belief in their own family and friends they don't trust their own family and friends they have trust issues but one thing that is so interesting to me is that we don't trust the people we know but we will trust people we don't know let me explain went to Oklahoma City this week and on the way back I flew back Thursday we get on the plane from Dallas to Indie and the captain gets on the pilot gets on the uh uh intercom and he says we're going to be delayed uh we need to put more gas into the plane the the the cloud coverage in Indie is is low and dense and there may be some visibility challenges and we may have to divert to another airport so we need to make sure we have plenty of gas in case we need to divert all right now already I don't I don't do well with flying I don't do well with turbulence I don't like hearing the words divert you know what I mean I'm like but I sat there like everybody else I didn't say hey can I talk to the pilot first say can we have a little convert like how you going to know we need to divert or not like how do you when when do you know it's too dense or we can't land like how long how long you've been training have you trained for this cloud coverage and diverted I didn't get to say any or do any of that I sat there like everybody else and completely trusted a pilot I never met I don't know I don't know if he slept well last night I don't know if he's got his contacts in I don't know but obviously the brother and sister got me here safely We Trust Pilots we never met we trust the Uber driver we don't don't know are they really taking us to the right location now now how many like me I put it in my phone anyway I'm like I'm watching my phone with that Uber driver I'm just I got trust issues y'all and but we trust the chef in the kitchen the Barista in the coffee shop we trust the mechanic fixing our brakes the tire shop T tightening our lug nuts on our tires we trust the Post Office and fed and UPS Amazon to get our packages and go into the right address we trust all kinds of people we don't even know and something else that's interesting is that a lot of people will trust the airline pilot the Uber driver and the mechanic more than they trust God Christians will trust God with their eternity but not with their life they have trust issues people pray the Salvation prayer and trust God with their future but they don't trust God with their now they trust God to get them to their Eternal destination but not to get them to their Earthly destinations and as we begin this new series the only way that you will stay in your lane and fulfill your god-given purpose is to learn to trust God with your life and not just your eternity to trust God with your life you have to understand a couple very important theological truths the first truth is that God has a purpose and plan for your life if you're going to trust God with your life you must understand that God made you and he has a plan and a purpose for your life you are not an accident you're not here by chance it's not a coincidence it's not by luck no God created you it was God's idea that you would be on this planet and God has a specific plan and purpose for your life people in the Bible understood this very important theological truth look at Isaiah 44:2 this is what the Lord says he who made you who formed you in the womb God made you and he formed wared you in your mother's womb Isaiah 49:1 it says listen to me you Islands hear this you distant Nations before I was born the Lord called me from my mother's womb he has spoken my name God calls people before they were born he has a plan for our lives before we came out of our mother's womb Isaiah 49:5 it says and now the Lord speaks the one who formed me in my mother's womb to be his servant who commissioned me to bring Israel back to him the Lord has honored me and my God has given me strength God formed you in your mother's womb and he has a purpose and plan for your life job 14:5 it look look what it says it says a person's days are determined you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed God has numbered the days of our lives and has set limits we cannot exceed God has created each of us on purpose and with limits I have limits I can't play the drums oh I wish I could I wish I could go in that drum cage and just I can't even play a good air drum you know what I mean y'all were like is that what you were doing Pastor Chris I have limits I will never be 69 and Dun A basketball God has a unique purpose for my life so he put limits on my life Jeremiah 15 it says before I formed you in the womb I knew you before you were born I set you apart I appointed you as a prophet to the Nations God has appointed you to accomplish certain things and to impact certain people there are God ordained appointments for your life there are experien in people that God has appointed for your life there are opportunities that God has appointed for your life there are some jobs and assignments God has appointed for your life before you were born god Set you apart and appointed certain things for your life the Apostle Paul understood this theological truth look at Galatians 1: 15 he says but when God who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace was pleased god Set you apart from your mother's womb and he call he has called you to accomplish certain things by his grace come on look at your neighbor and tell them God has called you to some things come on tell them right now God has called you to some things God's called you to some things you have to understand this about your great God Jeremiah 10:23 it says Lord I know that people's lives are not their own it is not for them to direct their steps because we have been created by God set apart by God appointed and called by God our lives are not our own we belong to God we don't want to direct our own steps and follow our own plans we want to follow God and allow him to direct our steps into his plan for our lives and so today and throughout this series I want to look at the life of David in the Bible David understood this very important theological truth that God created him and had a plan for his life he didn't create his own steps he didn't follow his own plan for his life he followed God's plan and purpose for his life David wrote these words in Psalm 40 ver5 many Lord my God are the Wonders you have done the things you planned for us none can compare with you were I to speak and to tell of your Deeds they would be too many to declare David knew that God had planned things for his life long ago he knew that God had some experiences some people some opportunities some jobs some assignments already planned for his life and because David had this deep conviction he trusted God David wrote in psalm 139:13 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mother's womb he wrote in verse 16 your eyes saw my unformed body body all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be David trusted God because he understood that God knit him together in his mother's womb he understood that before he came out of his mother's womb that God already had a plan and purpose for his life and I want you to see how this practically played out in David's life in 1 Samuel chap chapter 16 God chose David to be the next king of Israel and what's interesting about the story is that when God chose David to be the next King David was clueless he had no clue he was about to be chosen as the next king look at 1st Samuel chapter 16 ver1 it says the Lord said to Samuel how long will you mourn for Saul since I have rejected him as king over Israel fill your horn with oil and and be on your way I'm sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem I have chosen one of his sons to be king God told the prophet Samuel that he had already chosen the next king which was David but David didn't have a clue here's your big takeaway you have to understand that God has a plan and purpose for your life God has ordained your days before you came out of your mother's womb and since this is true it means god is the one who gives you opportunities leadership positions and promotions your promotions and opportunities come from God David wrote this in Psalm 75:7 it is God who judges he brings one down he exalts another David had a deep conviction that God is the one who promotes God was the one who removes Saul from being King and God was the one who exalted David to become the king and what we learned from David is we need to trust God to bring his purpose and his plan to pass in our lives see when you really understand this truth you begin to trust God at a deeper level because you know he has a plan and he has a purpose for your life you are confident that God has opportunities assignments people and jobs for your life and if you follow God he will bring his plan to pass for your life God will promote you and Elevate you to where he wants you to be if you trust him if you will trust him and David trusted God psalm 22:9 he says yet you brought me out of the womb you made me to trust in you even at my mother's breath David trusted God from a very early age Psalm 716 he says from birth I have relied on you because David knew that God had a purpose for his life he relied on God he leaned on God he trusted God's plan and purpose for his life and then in Acts 13:36 it says now when David had served God's purpose in his own generation he fell asleep he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed what set David apart from most people is he didn't direct his own steps he trusted God to direct his life he focused his whole Focus was living out God's purpose for his life and many people don't live out God's purpose for their life they live out their purpose they pursue their dream instead of God's dream they pursue what they want instead of what God wants they pursue their will instead of God's will they trust their plan instead of God's plan people get distracted from their god-given purpose they spend their life focusing on position instead of purpose on promotion instead of purpose on prominence instead of purpose on Prestige instead of purpose on popularity instead of purpose but when you study the life of David you will never see him focused on getting a position or prominence or Prestige or popularity he was focused on living out God's purpose let's look back at 1st Samuel 16 verse 5 Samuel replied yes in peace I have come to sacrifice to the Lord consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice so Samuel invited all of Jesse's Sons to the sacrifice and at this sacrifice the next king of Israel was going to be selected and anointed look at verse 11 so he asked Jesse are these all the sons you have there is still the youngest Jesse answered he is tending the Sheep Samuel said send for him we will not sit down until he arrives I wonder why David wasn't at the sacrifice it his father tell him not to come did his brother say hey man you're the youngest there's no way they're going to pick you to you don't need to be at the sacrific all right you still wiping your nose and whatnot you you're not going to be the next king you know go on go on with the Sheep I'm not exactly sure why David wasn't at the sacrifice but what's so interesting is David never tried to make himself the next king he wasn't in the house house with the rest of the brothers seeking after position or promotion David trusted God with his life and with his future he had a deep conviction that what God had for him was for him and as long as he followed God the Lord would bring his plan to pass in his life see his brothers couldn't stop David's Destiny they couldn't steal or stop the purpose purp that God had for his life David had such a deep trust in God that even after he was appointed to be the next king he went right back to taking care of the sheep went right back taking care of the sheep he he never sought after position he didn't try to make it happen or force himself to be the next king look at 1st Samuel 16:13 it says so Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers and from that day on the spirit of the Lord Came powerfully Upon David Samuel then went to Rama 1st Samuel 16:19 it says then Saul sent Messengers to Jesse and said send me your son David who is with the Sheep David was selected and anointed to be the next king the spirit of God came on him with power to be the next king but David went right back to taking care care of the sheep he wasn't seeking a position he was seeking God's purpose shoot a lot of us would have changed our social media account if we got anointed to be the king you know what I'm saying we' be like the next king appointed and anointed bow down to the king you know what I mean oh we wouldn't let everybody know where my crown give I need a selfie with my crown we would have tried to help God out where my where my Throne God where you need me to go hey God I got this now I'm the king I'll start running stuff and we would have been trying to make things happen we would have tried to force it to happen but David trusted God's plan and purpose and he went right on back to taking care of the sheep and in the story of David what happens next reveals the Deep level of trust that he had in God see King Saul was being tormented by a demon so he called David to the Palace to play the harp for him David obeyed the King's Command he went to the palace and he he played the harp for the king and during that whole time if you read he didn't try to make himself the king he didn't try to usurp the king he didn't go around telling all the workers at the palace you know who I am right you know I mean he didn't try to manipulate man you see the king over here I think we need to go ahead and make me the king this dude crazy over here want me to play him a little harp because he's having some nightmares I don't no no no no no he didn't do any of that he didn't say do you know who I am he didn't try to manipulate the situation or people to make himself King no no no he trusted God and he served the king he played the harp and trusted God he focused on seeking God's purpose not a position David had a deep conviction that what God had for him was for him no one could stop God's plan and purpose for his life not even the current King all he needed to do was trust and follow God and some of you are not going to live out God's purpose for your life life because you're seeking after the wrong things you have the wrong Focus you're seeking position promotion prominence Prestige and popularity instead of seeking God's purpose you're not trusting God you're trusting yourself you're spending all your energy fighting for a position you're spending all your time trying to make yourself look good trying to prove yourself to people trying to manipulate people and circumstances you're tearing others down so you can make yourself look good you're consumed with jealousy and envy why does that person have the job or position I should have that position I'm better better than them I'm more qualified than them I got more experience than them and perhaps all of that is true it was true for David I mean King Saul had a demon and David had the spirit of God on his life David was definitely more spiritually qualified to be the king but his focus wasn't on on a position it was on God's purpose and so here's the question I want you to wrestle with this week are you focused on serving God's purpose or is your focus on position promotion prominence Prestige and popularity let me ask it again here's the question I want you to wrestle with are you focused on serving God's purpose or is your focus on position promotion prominence Prestige and popularity do you trust God with your future or are you trusting you are you leaning on God or are you leaning on yourself and you may be saying well Pastor how do I trust God with my future what does it practically look like to trust God with my life and future if I shouldn't be focused on position promotion prominence Prestige and popularity what should I be focused on listen don't miss next Sunday matter of fact don't miss one week of this series because I'm going to tell you what you should be focused on so that you can discover so that you can stay in your lane and and and so that you can live out God's purpose for your life don't miss one week I'm going help you stay in your lane so you can be focused on God's purpose for your life acts 13:36 it says now when David had served God's purpose hear me today God has good plans for you he has good plans for you he has a purpose for your life you are not an accident he's got good plans and if you will trust him trust him trust him trust him I'm telling you you'll be able to discover the good purpose the good plans that God has for you that just like David you'll know what God has for you he has for you and so I want to encourage you and be in his house being in this series God has something incredible that he wants to do in and through every one of our lives he has good plans for you
r0XkIWvTvLQ,well today we are continuing uh our series called speed kills and this whole series is about how life is at a pace that is just faster than ever and that word busy even this morning somebody said hey has it been a busy week and I was about I'm like I'm gonna start using different words it's been a productive uh week um but I I think all of us can relate to how busy life gets and the problem is in our world and culture we we're busy as a badge of honor busy is a badge of honor for many and we we think lots of activity leads to lots of productivity but if you'll slow down long enough to take an honest look we see that busy will break you not bless you busy will break you not bless you and believe it or not your pace is a very spiritual issue Corey ten Boone said if the devil can't make you bad he'll make you busy and the devil wants to make you busy because he wants to break you but God wants to bless you and so this whole series is to to learn how we don't allow busy to break our lives but we can live our life the way God intends and God wants to bless our lives and one of the simplest Keys we miss on is how living with margin everybody say margin living with margin can Safeguard us against a crash matter of fact the title of my message today is is from maxed to margin from Max to margin having margin can help save us from our life crashing when I was uh in college I grew up here in Indianapolis but I went to college in Springfield Missouri it's about a seven hour drive to Springfield and when I went away to college I was horribly homesick I came home almost every weekend imagine Friday classes get out seven hour drive home I think I was in the car more than I was home but that's how much that's how homesick I was and then every Sunday at my school it was a Bible College they had curfew they lock the doors if you don't make it in by midnight so Sunday I had to time it just right until Sunday oftentimes I would leave at a good time and make it before midnight but oftentimes on Friday I'd be leaving late in the afternoon because classes or whatever and so I'm leaving at five or six and I'm trying to drive all the way and so a lot of times I'm getting home two or three a.m now I'm a night owl any other night owls in here like really in college two to three a.m it was nothing okay but there were some times I don't know what it was I don't know if I had a test that day I don't know if I'll wore myself out but there were a couple times I was driving home late at night where I started I started getting a little sleepy you know what I mean you ever feel like you're blinking or so what do you do you roll down the window so I'd roll down all the windows turn up the music come on it didn't matter what it was Celine Dion if it needed to be [Music] where ver you are I mean I'm just trying to stay awake y'all and I'm slapping come on anybody ever slapped yourself trying to keep yourself awake well y'all one night I didn't get the music on I didn't get the windows open and I wasn't slapping myself and I I dozed and I started to Swerve off the road and all of a sudden it was like burnt rumble strips come on does anybody thank the Lord for rumble strips if that road did not have some margin and rumble strips on it y'all I probably wouldn't be standing here today that margin though that saved my life I thought it was interesting I went on a missions trip once to Peru and I remember when we get in there noticing a lot of the cars don't have side mirrors I'm like why don't they have side mirrors and then we got driving on a road and I realized they think one lane is three lanes I mean I mean they are I mean you could reach out and grab somebody's and the card I mean they drive so close together bumping I mean we were multiple times bumping and right by each other I mean it was it was crazy and because they didn't have no margin a lot of times they just knocked off their side mirror or they were in a crash that knocked it off no margin it led to a crash and most people are they're living their life with no margin a lot of people they're you living your life like this check out this video foreign [Applause] [Music] how many of your blood pressure just went up as soon as you saw that how many you you you were like holding your breath you know what I mean and so we got a picture here but a lot of us we're living our we have no margin and we are on the verge with one misstep one thing to literally fall off a cliff to crash our life to crash our marriage because there's no margin high speed plus no margin equals disaster less margin leads to more wrecks but this is how a lot of people are living their lives this is how a lot of people are running their schedules it's high speeds no margin and not even realizing that they're about to crash their health their finances their marriage and their family and this is so simple yet it's so critical listen margin isn't just a nice thought or a luxury but literally a matter of life or death where there is no margin there's no room for error and that's not a healthy place to be and it's amazing to me how often I live my life just assuming that nothing extra is going to happen that everything's just going to be perfect there's going to be no bumps or no challenges or no surprises or no unexpected circumstances and when I'm doing that I'm making Satan's job way too easy because he wants to distract us he wants us stressed out burden high blood pressure heart attack home filled with stress and tension marriage redlining he wants to break us but God wants to bless us and so I want us to learn today that sometimes the deciding factor in being broken or blessed is your pace and so today we're going to look at a scripture and we're going to learn how to live with margins so that we can be blessed and not broken and so we're going to look at the life of Moses it is safe to say Moses was extremely busy I mean he just LED Israel out of Egypt led him through the Red Sea he's now their leader their spokesperson God's prophet and the story we're coming up to he's now even serving as a judge for the people and his father-in-law comes and visits him and they exchange some pleasantries and then we see what we're going to see next is super insightful look at Exodus chapter 18 verse 13 and 16. it says the next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people and they stood around him from morning till evening when his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people he said what is this you're doing for the people why do you alone sit his judge why all these people stand around you from Mourning till evening and Moses answered because the people come to me to seek God's will whenever they have a dispute it is brought to me and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and instructions come on leave it up to your father-in-law to come and do some poking around like whatever hey what what we got going on over here and it didn't take him about five minutes to realize what was happening was not good and that's usually the way it works when we're in the thick of it oftentimes we can't see it we can't see the lack of margin we're the last one to see it but God gives us Moses and Jethro in this story to hold up a mirror this morning because he wants to bless us and so I want to give you three steps to go from maxed out to margin three steps to go from maxed out to margin the first first step is this you got to be real about your margin be real about your margin Exodus 18 verse 17 and 18 Moses father-in-law replied what you are doing is not good you and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out the work is too heavy for you and you can't handle it alone Jethro but he didn't means words like he could have easily went to he left and be like I don't know what Moses is doing a brother tripping are you trying to be the judge over there can you believe that oh man we better say some prayers for them no no no Jethro just got right to it he got real he said man this is not good this is not good for you it's certainly you want to be out here waiting every day with these people waiting in line is high you know how folks get when they're just sitting outside and it's hot from morning till night oh this is not going to go good for you and this is definitely not going to go good for them is this is too heavy you can't do this and here's the beautiful thing Moses didn't get defensive and we can't either I'm here to tell you got to be real about your margin you got to take an honest audit don't deceive yourself don't we listen we like to make excuses we like to feel like worthy exception you know what I mean like like like God understands you don't understand I can't afford to not to have my list I guess it's all on me I gotta do I gotta if I don't get it done nobody else is gonna if I don't do it right away and so we live without margin we make excuses and we justify it and we think we're the the exception and then all of a sudden our eyes starts twitching you know what I mean or or you're you're driving to work and then that person gets in front of you and you're like they are trying to Slow Me Down they pulled in front of my car but it becomes personal they got margin they're just chilling driving to work but you got none and you're frustrated and mad and angry you're thinking evil thoughts about them some of you you ready to honk your horn wait until you can pass them on the other side and and we we don't have margin and listen there have been times in my life where I felt like where I didn't have any margin where I was packing out my my schedule time in my life where things were not good but I didn't want to see it and I'm thankful for the Lord because there have been many times in my life where the Lord has spoken four words to me four words these four words I believe God's going to speak some of these four words to somehow this is what God this is what God says to me he says Chris that's not one of the words four words take off the cape take off the cape take off the cape you are not Superman and you will never be Superman take oh you're not Superman I didn't create you to be Superman I'd encourage you to be Superwoman you got to take off the stop trying to do everything and and I've needed those words because there's times in my life where I didn't have any margin and I was headed towards a dangerous place and I could tell because I'm frustrated and I'm stressed and I'm agitated and I'm irritated and and often times the Lord's like Chris take off the cape you are doing too much this is not good there's no way around it when margin decreases stress increases and many people you're listening to me right now you love God you hate the devil you worship you're in church in a small group you're serving and you're seeking God but the truth is you're not living with margin in your lives and the result is you're allowing your pace to rob you of your peace listen this is a very this is a spiritual Point okay this isn't just some inspirational leadership quote folks can spend time uh here's here's what's happening in our world folks can't spend time with their kids because their pace is so great can't sleep at night because stress is so high can't be generous the way they want to because they're strapped financially can't serve the church because their schedule is already out of control margin is low stress is high the gas light is blinking and the blood and your blood pressure keeps rising and hear me today you don't need to know Greek or Hebrew you don't need a nine week bible study you don't even have to rebuke the devil some of you will move from stress to blessed by simply taking an honest audit of your pace being real about your margin Jethro looked at Moses and he said this is not good number two to go from Max to margin is you have to determine what you should do versus what you could do determine what you should do versus what you could do let's look back at Exodus 18 verse 19 through 22. it says listen now to me and I'll give you some advice and may God be with you you must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to them to him teach them his decrees and instructions and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave but select capable men for all the people men who fear God trustworthy men who hate dishonest game and appoint them as officials over thousands hundreds fifties and tens have them serve as judges for the people at all times but have them bring every difficult case to you the simple cases they can decide themselves that will make your load lighter because they will share it with you see Moses was the spokesman for the people Prophet messenger for God served as commander-in-chief but he didn't have to be the judge the being a judge was a could do not or should do there were a lot of things Moses could have done there are a lot of things people wanted him to do but listen you can't allow others to determine what you should do nor sign you and your kids up for everything you could do and so Jethro and Moses they discussed a plan he didn't just hope things would magically change and we got to do the same we have to be intentional we have to determine whether the should do's and the could Do's if I'm going to live with margin in my life I have to be disciplined and diligent the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 15 and 16 it says be very careful then how you live not as unwise but as wise making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil we gotta walk in wisdom so that we can live in blessing and so how do you know if it's a could do or it should do see typically whether something is whether or not we should do something it's based off asking the wrong questions let me explain one of the wrong questions we'll ask is do we want to do it do we want to buy it do we want to eat it but listen if you value margin and priorities it's going to cause you to think Beyond this because just because we want it doesn't mean we need it see a lot of people think that just because the new iPhone comes out they should buy it but just because you want it doesn't mean you need it and you're like Pastor I was ordering the new one tomorrow what are you trying to tell me right now I'm not trying to tell you anything that's between you and the Lord if he says yes you go ahead get you that iPhone 14 but if he says no don't do it I just think we're asking the wrong often times as if we want it then we need to get it no no no just because you want it doesn't mean you need it my son Jace he turns 15 today and this summer yeah he turns 15. and so this summer he got his first job got a j-o-b Jace was slinging some custard for Jesus come on he was he's working and proud of him and he really loved work and did a great job and oh but when he got that first paycheck hundred and fifty dollars hey when you're 14 man 150 dollars he's ready to run to the gas station and spend it all no no but we got to sit down and talk with Jace just because you got a paycheck for 150 doesn't mean you need to spend just because you want to doesn't mean you need to and so we got to sit him down no no hey first thing we do is tithe and so Jace got the he has the People's Church app and he went on the People's Church app and he tithed on his first check and he continues to tithe and then we save and so he's saving and then we use wisdom on what's okay what is a wise amount for you to have to spend okay now does he always spend it wisely I'm not sure I think Leo's the gas stations getting a lot of that money but we wisely determine what's in there and we're wisely making sure he's tithing and he's saving just because we want to doesn't mean we we we need to here's another question we asked it's not a good question we ask is it good or bad now this seems like a good question right if it's good it's okay and if it's bad it's not but just because it's good doesn't mean it's right just because it's good doesn't mean it's right and a lot of us are so busy doing good things we're missing out on the best things listen going to work and providing for your family that is a good thing it's a God thing but putting in so many hours that you're missing time with your family isn't a win your kids being involved in sports and other activities can be a wonderful thing unless it destroys all your margin everything that's good doesn't mean it's right and just remember when you sign your child up you're really signing you up you know what I mean and I always think it's funny when man I got all these practices I can't believe I gotta go here and go and I'm like who signed them up they didn't sign that waiver on their own maybe a time to take a step back and be real about your margin just because it's good doesn't mean it's right and listen James and I we we were married we're both in full-time Ministry we love Ministry we have three kids all in three different stages of life we got one in high school we got one in middle school and we got a four-year-old that's not in school he's schooling us every single day pray for us this dude's so stinking cute it's like man you oh you know you know what you're doing when you're four years old like that but he's four and then we got a dog that's not even two and we just had times in our life where all men is is practice and practice and games and games and then it's meetings in this thing we got a big old family like I think 30 people in both of our families and they all live here in Indianapolis I promise you it feels like we're doing a birthday party every single week we got one tonight because it's Jason's birthday but birthday parties and family gatherings and family outings and listen Jamie I we hit a season where every night we had something and they were good things I'm not saying support so bad I'm not saying spending time with your family's bad I'm not saying birthday parties are bad the church meetings we were having we love our church we love meeting with people we love developing we love but we were having something every single night and we were starting to fuss and get irritated and frustrated and we're like we can't keep doing this like we got a figure just because it's good doesn't mean it's right and so we had to sit we had a we had to come to Jesus like all right we got to figure out what we should do and then what we could do and we're going to make time for should do date night family night should do we're going to be in church should do our kids will be an epic every Wednesday night should do Jamie is the worship Pastor so she'll be here Thursday night practicing should do but we got other nights of the week where again it's good news and we had to learn what we could and could not do what we could say yes to and what we could say no to we had to sit our kids down we had to explain to them because they listen to spend the night every night have their friends spend the night every night like literally and it's been a night a good thing absolutely but it may not be the right thing so it explained and then we had to sit them down and we had to talk because we did not have a good pace and it was starting to break us and so listen just because it's good doesn't mean that that it's right it's not the right question to always ask because when margin goes down I'm telling you stress goes up life gets overwhelming listen you know you're stressed out and your pace isn't good when you're in the bathroom with the door locked but you're not going to the bathroom you're just hiding from people you just don't want to see you know what I mean you don't want to see anybody okay that might be a good case for you to look at your schedule and figure out what is going on kids got their fingers crawling underneath the door mommy daddy I'm going to the bathroom but you're not you just needed a break it's a good sign just because it's good doesn't mean it's right here's another question we asked the wrong question is can I do it just because I could do it doesn't mean I should do it I I love sports I love going I don't I really love watching sports live and I like all of them I love High School sports college sports and I like Pro and I go to high school basketball games boys games girls games volleyball game I go to a baseball game Jamie's like really you just want to sit at a baseball game man I go to all I go to I mean I just I love it and and that stuff's going on year round and then you got college games right now and I get tickets and I'm like yes absolutely let's do it and I listen I'll just I'll go to everything but but again just because I can do it doesn't mean I should do it and I was getting to a point where I was just going to too much stuff I want to say yes to everything I'm like how do I turn down these tickets like oh my oh I've never gone to the stadium before how do I turn this down or oh yeah I want to watch that student but I realized it wasn't good it wasn't healthy and just because I could do it I mean it doesn't mean I should and so I had to turn some stuff away I turned some stuff away that was painful I was like I cannot believe y'all I had some final four final four tickets I've never gone to a final four game and I got final four tickets and it was the same day on Cali it was Cali's birthday how do I ask and explain this to my dog I'm just playing just because you could doesn't mean you should and so I've learned I gotta say no to a lot more than I'm saying yes to matter of fact the two most powerful letters in the alphabet to help you get margin n o y'all got to learn it everybody say no yes some of y'all aren't good at that okay so we gotta we gotta work on just because you can doesn't mean that you should when margin goes down stress goes up when stress walks in peace walks out let me give you some better questions to ask number one am I doing what God has called me to do am I doing what God's called me to do are my priorities in line with God's word and God's will am I doing more than God has called me to do here's another question am I living with margin so I can say yes to what God speaks to me so I can say yes to what God speaks to me with my finances relationship time and serving the problem is we're really good at saying no to God and not that good at saying no to the world we got to get better at saying yes to God and no to culture and the world all right the Lo the right questions will lead to the right plan you got to be honest realistic intentional what do you need to stop doing and what do you need to do differently and then here's the third thing how do we go from from maxed out to margin you got to make the changes make the changes Exodus 18 23 and 24. it says if you do this and God so commands you will be able to stand the strain and all these people will go home satisfied and the Bible says Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said listen this was for Moses's health and the people as well Moses not only took an honest look he not only got a plan but he did everything they said I can't just afford to say a good amen to needing margin I have to do something about it how I live my life will affect me and affect others my marriage is impacted by my pace and my peace my kids are impacted by my stress and lack of margin my ability to love and care for people is impacted by the way I manage my time don't just think about it don't just talk about it you have to do something about it because your personal peace is at stake your marriage is counting on you your kids are watching and learning from you your health is on the line and ultimately God's plan for your life is at stake listen I'm not trying to over spiritualize this but you must understand this series is not a self-help series when you're being challenged to discover your your purpose your god-given purpose it's not because God needs something from you it's so easy to feel like work needs me school needs me soccer needs me kids need me spouse needs me now God needs more of me and listen it's not so that you can have more margin for the cares of this world and so you can be who God created you to be and do what he created you to do see we need to be busy about what matters what counts for eternity not out of Duty or guilt we don't serve or give out of pressure we live with margin so we can be on mission for what matters God has something for you not wanting something from you I uh I've been fortunate to go overseas and I've done a trip to England and France and when you go there you have to get euros and pounds to to spend but my home is here in America and so when my trip is done if I bring the euros and the pounds here to the United they're worthless they're youthless I got to exchange them back in so I can get American dollars to use in my home and listen our ultimate home is heaven God wants us to live this life and have the margin we need to have so that we can make an impact for heaven for what really matters and make sure we don't have the wrong currency and the wrong focus and given our time to the wrong things God wants to use your time talent and treasure on Earth for eternity where the reward will last and that will not happen if we live at a frantic chaotic peace and listen there's so much for me to repent of I'll be honest with you busyness rarely hits my radar it's hitting my radar right now I just need y'all to know these messages are hitting me between the eyes before they touch yours and I'm learning that my pace is a very spiritual issue and I have a responsibility to live my life and spend my days in ways that honors God and to do that I have to be courageous enough to evaluate and make some changes listen your most important step is the next step and so what's your next step maybe you need to talk with a friend or small group tell them what you're going to change you may need to ask them you may need them to help them help you priority prioritize what are your should Do's or your could Do's maybe you need to meet as a family as me and Jamie did and share with each other's what you need to do different so that you the the what is what you can change effective immediately come on maybe you need to leave five minutes earlier than you normally do so that uh not not if but when that person gets in front of you driving 10 miles an hour under the speed limit you're not losing your mind maybe you need to go to bed 30 minutes earlier starting tonight we need to watch 30 minutes less of TV come on start each day five minutes of silence in God's presence clear your head quiet your heart give God your day you can increase it but at least start their five minutes of silence with God Psalm 46 10 it says Be Still and know that I'm God we're not very good at being still and that's why many are maxed out that's why busy is Wrecking our life but I'm telling you right now if you learn to be still to be still to evaluate be real about your margin God wants to bless you to be real to identify and say as Jethro said man this is not good and then figure out what are your should Do's versus your good news and then make the changes promise you promise you God did not create you to keep up with the rat race or culture or the world or to run yourself ragged he did not create you to wear off to wear the cape God's saying take the cape off he's saying take no if you'll get focused on what really matters what I really put you on this work for you can still hustle and be healthy but you got to have a margin you have to have margin so I'm gonna end with these two questions number one what step is God asking you to take and number two what can you do to increase the margin
z8i8Rc24qeo,uh but today Pastor Andrew our youth pastor he has a word from you he is uh a great great preacher and so would you please welcome our youth pastor Pastor Andrew to the stage as he brings the word today wow what an honor People's Church come on can you keep your hands going for Jesus this morning amen amen what an honor it is to to preach God's word today what an honor it is to be at People's Church I don't know about you but I cannot think of a better place to be on a Sunday morning than right here uh I just thank God for the incredible move that's been taking place uh in this church I tell people all the time if you know me you've heard this before uh but I'm I actually turned 25 years old next week so literally from the womb uh to this very moment for 25 years in a row uh I've known nothing else uh but church and so I've been a part of many different uh Church experiences but I mean it from the bottom of my heart when I say I've never been a part of a church like People's Church what God is doing here is just so so special and extraordinary and it all starts with God honoring leadership are you thankful for our pastors come on can you let our pastors know how much you love them and thank God for them and man we honor them and I want to say it's an honor uh to be the youth pastor here at peop church you just saw my lovely wife a moment ago just here welcoming uh everybody my wife Jess and I we've been a part of people's Church it'll be five years uh this fall we've been the student pastors full-time here at People's Church for about uh three it'll be three years this summer and have just seen God do incredible things in the early stages of our youth ministry but we also believe that we're just scratching the surface and that we've not gotten anywhere close to seeing everything that God wants to do in this next generation and I wholeheartedly believe uh I didn't just grow up in church my whole life I'm a uh 100% pure blood hooer uh I'm Indiana born and rais and so I'm a big sports fan forgive me but I believe that uh in a tight game you always have your best players on the field and on the court if you're with me say amen and I believe that as the church we're currently living in the last days and I believe with uh eternity on the line that God has his best players he has the best generation in the game the final moments he said I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh your sons and your daughters will prophesy and I believe this generation is marked for greatness they're not just going to be used in the future but God is calling them to make a difference now and so I say all that to say y'all that's not the sermon but I do say all that to say man if your middle school high school student is not plugged into our youth

preach it I believe something good is going to happen turn over somebody next to you say I love Jesus more than you today it's that 11 o'clock service come on somebody today we're continuing our series called own it how many of you been blessed by this series so far 12 of you praise God I know I've been blessed said they're like oh Lord what happened they just gave the youth pastor the microphone I know I've personally been blessed uh in this series in fact our the verse that's kind of been the theme for this whole series is Philippians chapter 2 verse2 and Paul wrote to the body of Christ to continue to work on your own salvation with fear and trembling and that's exactly what we've been talking about and learning to do we've been learning how to stop making excuses for not having the type of life that we want we've been learning to stop stop blaming other people to stop blaming other circumstances and instead to own what we can do and as you strive to own take ownership of your relationship with God you'll discover a lot of things and I believe one of the things we discovers that there are doors you need to close in your life but there are also doors that you need to open and I love that last week our pastor got all up in our business and talked about closing the door on poor financial stewardship uh but today I really for the next few moments I want to talk to you about opening a door I want to talk to you about and it's no it's not for poor financial stewardship so I want to talk to you on the subject of opening the door to see a move of God take place in your life the title of my message today is own your opportunity own your opportunity I I remember uh one day I was about 17 uh maybe not quite 18 years old at the time it was around Father's Day time and there was a Saturday afternoon I decided I was going to go out and buy my dad a gift for Father's Day now at the time I did not have my license uh very long so like any good Godly wise uh parents would do they had like boundaries they had rules for new drivers to follow how many you know that's like that's Godly advice good parents ing amen and one of those rules was hey we're great if you want to go places just let us know where you're going when you're leaving and when you plan to come back some of you are like oh my gosh like the windows of Heaven just opened and divine revelation right there that's good parenting uh but this one particular day you know I thought man I not going to tell them where I'm going because it would be lame to say hey I'm going to get you a Father's Day gift and spoil the surprise so I thought you know what it's 101 15 minutes out of the way I'll just go get the gift come back they won't even know that I left and so I get in the car I drive about 101 15 minutes away from where we were living at the time and I go to the Starbucks I get out of the car I walk into the Starbucks I buy the gift I walk out it plain and simple and I remember getting to the car and I reached into my pocket to grab my keys and they aren't there so I go to the second pocket no big deal I feel they're not there I'm like oh Lord Jesus I get to the third pocket by that time I'm like I'm not praying in English I'm like lord they're not in the third pocket y'all I get to the fourth and final pocket I do not have my keys on me and I'm like oh Lord so I like look up and I look through the driver window and sure enough my car keys are lying right there in the driver's seat so I immediately think okay I just locked myself out of the car for the first time ever what do I do I'm like okay easy I'll call somebody to come and help help me so I reach in my pocket again to grab my phone it's not in the pocket so I'm like okay we'll go to Second pocket no problem it's not there third pocket I'm like today is not that day fourth in final pocket y'all I look I'm like surely no surely yes I look into the window on the driver's side and my phone is lying right there on the dash so not only had I locked my keys inside the car but now my cell phone is locked inside the car with it and I'm standing there like well what am I supposed to do come how many you know that's a spirit of stupid right there like 17 18y old kid now how many you know you've been locked out of your house you've been locked out of your cart no hands are going up so I must be the only one praise God uh it's inconvenient and it's very frustrating to not have access to a place where you need to go and I believe more importantly there's nothing more frustrating and inconvenient than when you encounter a closed door in your life when you en what do I mean by a closed door in your life you see there's a closed door between where you are and where you want to be perhaps you've been praying for a miracle that happened in your life for quite some time but you haven't seen it yet today can I I suggest to you that your Miracle might actually be closer than you think but you'll actually have to own your opportunity to see the miracle happen look over at the person next to you say you have to own it you have to own it I want to draw your attention to a story in scripture found in Acts chapter 12 before we read this text together allow me just to give you some context behind the story to help uh you understand the text better you see during this particular stage of the early church many Jesus followers are being persecuted for their public faith in Christ in fact uh right before this text we see that one of Jesus's closest disciples uh named James he had been arrested by King Herod and then was very quickly executed upon being arrested and whenever King Herod had James executed the Bible says that his popularity among the Jewish people began grow and so he's motivated to capture more Jesus followers and to have them executed and so he goes after none other than one of Jesus's closest disciples the Apostle Peter so he has him imprisoned and he has every intention of ending his life shortly thereafter and that's where our story picks up in Acts 12 verse 5 it says so Peter was kept in prison but everybody say but the church was earnestly praying to God for him come on are you thankful to be a part of a Praying church that believes in the power of prayer what I love is that we started this year with 21 days of prayer and fasting and come August we're going to do 21 days of prayer again I'm thankful to be a part of a church where the pastors and the staff Set Side set aside time regularly to pray over every need represented in this church family I'm thankful that we're a part of the church that we have people coming in here early at 8:45 every Sunday morning to seek the face of God and pray over all three of our worship experiences every week and I'm thankful to be a part of a church that has a prayer team down here at the front to pray over needs while the spirit of God is moving during the worship people church I'm thankful that we have prayer groups that pray during our services how many of you know that People's Church is a Praying church that believes in the power of Prayer that when you have a crisis when you have a need when you have an emergency you are not left to your own devices but rather you can turn to your brother or sister in Christ and you can seek the face of God In Prayer it says while Peter was in prison the church was praying for him let's go to verse six together it says the night before Herod was to bring him to trial Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and Cent stood guard at the entrance in verse number seven it says suddenly somebody say suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light Shone in the cell he struck Peter on the side and woke him up quick get up he said and the chains fell off Peter's wrists then the angel said to him put on your clothes and sandals how many you know that angel speaking to Peter like it's his middle school kid getting ready for school he's like get up put your clothes on put your shoes on we got to get out of here it says and Peter did so wrap your cloak around you and follow me the angel told him Peter followed him out of the prison but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening he thought he was seeing a vision verse 10 they passed the first and second guards and came to the Iron Gate leading to the city it opened for them by itself and they went through it now y'all are like that's not really impressive I went to Walmart the other day and the doors actually open by themselves when I y'all this is not Walmart okay this took manpower to make this happen but it happened supernaturally and it says when they had walked the length of one street there's that word again somebody say suddenly suddenly the angel left him as we read through these verses there's two suddenly that I want to draw your attention to the first suddenly we see in scripture is when the angel appeared in the jail cell now this was a supernatural divine intervention it was so unimaginable that Peter thought he was seeing a vision he thought there's no way way this is actually real and happening right in front of me now let me remind you who Peter was Peter was a man who literally walked hand in hand with God for three and a half years he saw Jesus raise the dead he saw him drive out demons he saw him touch lepers and then be healed he saw Jesus multiply uh Spar food and feed the multitudes he saw almost every type of miracle that Jesus had ever done and yet he's in the middle of a miracle and thinks there is no way this is actually real and then the second suddenly was when the angel left him I don't know about you but if I'm Peter I would have preferred the angel stayed with me the entire time like bro you broke me out of here I'm gonna get trouble for breaking out of prison you just like you're going to abandon me now like really but you see God was not abandoning Peter I think there are times in owning your relationship with God as you're working out your own salvation with fear and trembling when you have to learn how to walk by faith and not by sight I and just because listen just because you don't sense Divine help or guidance you don't feel the presence of God with you like you would like to doesn't mean that he's abandoned you or left you to deal with it on your own it doesn't mean that God is not working so don't just assume that something is wrong or that you're alone instead know that God is simply simply putting you in a position to do your part you see God broke Peter miraculously out of jail but Peter had to be the one to keep walking into Freedom let's keep reading in verse uh let's go verse 11 it says then Peter came to himself and said now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his Angel and rescued me from herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen he's like okay I was not dreaming I'm not tripping it's not the pizza I had last night this is the Lord verse 12 he says when this it says when this had dawned on him he went to the house of Mary the mother of John also called Mark where many people had gathered and were praying Peter knocked at the outer entrance in a servant named Roda everybody say hey Roa not Yoda Roda came to answer the door and it says when she recognized Peter's voice she was so overjoy she ran back without opening it and exclaimed Peter is at the door y'all Roa acted like a little kid when you answer the door instead of parents but you're like you're not going to open the door because you don't just open the door for anybody right but she knows Peter's right there she got so excited she left homeboy standing at the front door what's fascinating is that when she goes and tells them look at verse 15 here's what they told her you're out of your mind when she kept insisting that it was Peter they said I must be his Angel these people were so busy calling out to God they're praying for a miracle to happen the miracle shows up at the front door and what do they do they immediately dismiss it and go back to praying they're like nah that's impossible to happen it must be as angel or something like oh that's not impossible either like that's not Divine or Supernatural and church family if I'm being honest when I read this text it really messed me up because I can't tell you how many times I've been guilty of doing what these people have done how many times I've asked God to do a miracle in my life but I've missed the simple step of saying yes to something he's waiting for me to do and I think too many times as followers of Jesus we're so busy waiting on God to show up and do something when the reality is that God is actually waiting for us to do something verse 16 it says but Peter kept on knocking Peter must have thought why is it easier for me to get busted out of jail than it is to try to get into this prayer meeting like says he kept knocking and when they opened the door finally and saw him they were astonished Peter mentioned with a motion for his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out a prison he's like y'all need to keep it down because they are still looking for me and if they catch me again I'm not going to count on getting busted out of prison again so let me in the door he says tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this he said and then he left for another place in the morning there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter tell somebody sit next to you open the door open the door this is an incredible story that I believe there's so much we can unpack in it but today I just want to give you three things we learned from Acts chapter 12 that we need to do to open the door to see God move in our lives and the first thing we do is this number one you open a door when you pray it open you open a door when you pray it open a couple weeks ago i' had uh gone through a season of prayer and fasting just believe leaving for God to do different things in in our life and in our family and I was leaving one morning to go to my car and start my diet and I ran into one of our neighbors and I just said good morning and asked how she was doing and she said uh now this neighbor I've only interacted with like two or three times I don't even think she's asked me for my name once doesn't know what I do for a living but she goes hey baby I need you to pray for me and I'm like okay I could be like an atheist a serial killer but I'mma pray for you okay I'm like yeah how can I how can I be praying for you and she said man I need God to intervene on my job she said the industry I'm in we've suffered immensely since the pandemic they've been firing employees left and right and the ones they're keeping they're cutting back their hours and she said my hours have been cut back so drastically that for the first time in my life as a widow I may not be able to afford paying my own rent and I need God to show up and move and I'm like absolutely AB as I'm praying and fasting I'm going to pray for you believe for God to provide for you and open this door for you and she said man thank you so much I appreciate it she goes I have faith that God's provided for me before he'll keep providing for me she said I I've got a whiteboard next to my front door and I it's WR I wrote down something on it that I'll look at as the last thing I see when I get done praying and walk out the door she goes when I walk out the door to start my day the last thing I see is I work for blank and in the blank she had the name of the company that she the Lord had put on her heart to apply for a job there it's a highly regarded well-known healthare company uh here locally in our city that for this position they don't just hire anybody she said this is a huge step of faith for me but I know that if God leads me to it he'll see me through it and I was like man okay I'm like this lady is probably like physically 100 pounds but spiritually she's 250 you know what I'm saying I'm like God give me some of what she's got so I'm like I go through the season of praying and fasting and then a couple days ago I was up early and I'm on my way to the gym and as I'm walking to my car I hear hey hey baby over here over here over here here and I'm like what in the world and I look across the parking lot and it's that sweet little old Widow and so I like run over to the car to make sure everything is good and she goes baby you're not going to believe it I was like what tell me and she goes I didn't just get one interview not two interviews but I got a third interview I got the job and I start on March 18th y'all she did a little Holy Ghost shout down right there in the parking lot I walked over to my car and I said God if I had a fraction of the faith that this little old Widow had that you would take care of her like you've always done I don't know what I would see you do in my life I got home from the gym y'all I found every whiteboard I could inside our apartment I begin to write prayer requests left and right I said I'm going to put it where I can see it God I know if you did it for her you can do it for me Church there is power when you pray Jesus told his disciples there are some things that will not happen unless you pray and fast you see open doors they start with prayer and you need to understand everything is more spiritual than you realize that's why you need to keep praying for your marriage you need to keep praying for your kids in your family you need to keep praying for your health your finances because there are things that happen when we pray that won't happen if we don't pray and to see an open door for God to move move in your life listen it starts with prayer but it does not stop with prayer you see you don't just open a door when you pray it open but you also open a door when you take your next step you have to take your next step you've already prayed but now you need to worship you see you've you don't have to wait to see the miracle with your eyes before you get to praise him for it anyway that's what faith is you see you've been praying for God to send you the right person to be with but now that you've prayed you need to start becoming the right person that person will want to be with it could be that you're not waiting on God God is waiting on you what if the closed door is not an obstacle but rather it's an opportunity from God to allow you to develop your character and to grow in your work ethic you need to own this season of opportunity to grow and to become who God has called you to be as a as a spouse or a future parent don't just get frustrated by the closed door just take a Next Step just take the step in front of you I believe some of us have been praying for a miracle and our finances and God's saying great you've prayed but now you need the tithe it got real quiet you've prayed but now you need to give and OB oh well Pastor I just I can't afford the tithe the economy is so bad money's tight we're Balling on a budget the best we can we broke as a joke right but how many you know God is the question is not will God be faithful to do his part the question is will we be faithful to do our part because God says test me in this and see if I W open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing so big that you won't contain it God is faith ful to do his part we have to be faithful to do ours some of you been waiting for God to use you in a Great and Mighty way and he's saying you've prayed the prayer but now I need you to serve in the nursery on Sunday morning and love on some babies I need you to say yes and answer the call to become a youth leader on Wednesday nights and serve middle school and high school students and help them grow in the relationship with God and make a difference in their school and in their community you see you have to own your next step and I believe there's some of us today is saying pastor I've done I'm doing all that I'm coming to church every Sunday every Wednesday night I'm praying I'm in the word I'm serving and I'm giving but I feel like the door is still shut my friend I know that the Lord has sent me here today to tell somebody to do what Peter did and just keep knocking keep knocking come on don't stop knocking until the door opens because if you ask you'll receive it if you seek you'll find find if you'll knock the door will be open keep knocking keep praying keep serving keep loving keep believe and keep making a difference because just like Peter there's a suddenly on the way come on is there anybody in the house of God today thankful you serve a god of the suddenly he doesn't show up too early he doesn't show up too late he shows up right on time with a suddenly with an open door I feel like preaching today see you need to open you open a door when you pray it open you open a door when you take your next step and then lastly you open a door when you invest and invite you open a door when you invest and when you invite I already know some of y'all thought I'd forgot to finish the story about when I lock my keys in my phone in my car but I'm kidding there see I set it up like that being real smooth so I'm standing there keys phone locked inside the vehicle I'm like what am I going to do so I thought man I'll just do what any anointed 7 19yearold young man of God would do in that situation I walk into the Starbucks and I look around and I'm like who is the friendliest person in this Starbucks so I approached this gentleman who's working on his laptop and I say Excuse me sir I am so sorry to bother you but I accident I say accidentally like I could have done it on purpose I accidentally locked my keys in my phone inside my car I can't contact anybody to come and bring me the spare key I'm like if you wouldn't mind could I please just borrow your phone for a couple seconds to make a call and he's like he was super friendly he's like yeah man absolutely here's my phone take all the time you need I'm like man God bless you and so I like get the phone and I like I think I called my mom first and like no answer so then I call my sister I'm calling like anybody everybody I can think of but I'm not getting any responses this go in the voicemail every time and then it dawned on me I'm like most people won't answer a call if they don't recognize the number and I'm like so I'm standing there like God what do I do and then it it hit me I'm like there's one person I've not contacted yet my dad I thought God please anybody but my dad I'm like I got this gift for him I don't want to ruin the surprise and like I don't want him to kill me either because I left home I didn't tell anybody but I was desperate so I get the phone I call no answer call a second time no answer pick up a third time like man come on come on come on the ringing s and I hear hello who is this and I'm like Dad it's me it's Andrew your first born your beloved I'm like listen I'm at the Starbucks off State Road 135 I lock my keys my phone inside the car I need you to come bring me the spare key he's like wait what what are you doing there like you you didn't tell us you were you were leaving like wait how are you talking to me if you left your phone and I'm like hey there's this nice man he's let me use your phone he's like so you just went up to a random stranger and asked to use your and I'm like again the spirit is stupid pray for your youth pastor I'm like Dad if you could I'm sorry I I know I broke the rule but like I I don't want to ruin the surprise and all this stuff right I thought like man my dad is just going to go off on me but then I I stand there and I wait my dad says you hold on right there I'll come my dad pulls up in his truck and he brings me the key and he unlocks the car and then on F Father's Day comes obviously I open up or he opens up his gift and then we just laugh cuz it's like yeah this is why I broke the rule but I learned an important lesson that day for all the young people who just start driving like if your parents got rules follow them let them know where you're going in case the spirit of stupid hits you you lock your keys in the car there's a purpose to the story though I promise you I'm not just being goofy I believe sometimes sometimes we desire God to open a door for us and sometimes we really do need God to open a door for us but then sometimes God will call you to open the door for somebody else to receive a miracle how many know I couldn't get the car door open that day by myself I needed my dad to come and bring the key because he had access to the door that I did not have and there are some of you you are a miracle for somebody else God is calling you to be the answered prayer to somebody else's prayer it's great that you've been praying for your co-workers to come to Christ but now show up at work with donuts with Starbucks invest in that relationship with kindness encouragement build build Trust share an Easter invite card with a generous tip for your server make sure it's generous you represent Jesus and you represent People's Church come on somebody see God's responsible to do the supernatural but we're responsible to do the supern normal listen God did the heavy lifting and he broke Peter out of jail that day but he used a little servant girl named Roa to do something easy like open door God doesn't need you to get that lost person in your life saved or set free from drugs he needs you he'll do the supernatural he needs you to do the super normal you have an opportunity this Easter you have an opportunity every day to be a part of somebody else's Miracle but the question is will you own the opportunity will you say yes will you answer the call will you open the door and let God use you
7kvrs5mZDVs,well today we're continuing our series bounce back good advice for a bad day in this series we are examining the last seven statements of jesus before his death on the cross and if you missed any of the previous two messages from earlier in this series you can actually watch those on our youtube channel just go to youtube type in people's church indianapolis you'll see our channel all of our recent sermons but today we're gonna examine the third statement jesus made from the cross and so if you'd like to follow along with me in your bible you can go ahead and turn to the book of john chapter 19. i'll be reading from the new living translation the nlt if you didn't bring your bible you can follow along with us on the screen together john chapter 19 beginning at verse 25 here's what the bible says it says standing near the cross where jesus's mother and his mother sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene when jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved he said to her dear woman here is your son and he said to this disciple here is your mother and from then on this disciple took her into his home what a moment what a statement you see after after jesus had been betrayed after he had been beaten beaten so badly he was he couldn't be recognized by his mother his family everyone who knew him after he's been crucified in the middle of his most painful moment ever breathing his final breaths jesus noticed his mother and he was focused on his mother's well-being and on his mother's future you see at this point in their lives uh theologians and scholars if you will will tell us that mary's husband jesus's earthly father joseph has already uh he was already dead at this point in their lives and this is so this is why jesus wanted to make sure that his mom was going to be okay and could you even just begin to imagine what this moment must have been like for mary the mother of jesus to see your son hurting to see your child that you brought into this world suffering she's literally there to watch her baby boy lay down his life for all of humanity and yet what does jesus do in this moment jesus wants to take care of his mom in the middle of this suffering losing his life experiencing his final moments on the earth jesus asked his disciple john to take care of his mom and you see i think this is fascinating because what we learned from scripture is that jesus did not talk a whole lot when he was going to the cross and while he was on the cross that's why there were seven statements jesus made and yet that lack of dialogue that lack of communication what little we see jesus thought important enough for one of his last statements to talk about the importance of his family and you see i don't want to submiss church family how powerful and incredible this truly is because i don't know about you but when i'm experiencing any kind of pain in my life whether that be physical pain whether it be emotional pain spiritual pain the last thing that i tend to think about other people i think about me myself and i i turn inward and i just only begin to think about myself and what i'm going through but we see here that is not at all what jesus did if you're taking notes this morning the title today's message is simply this when you have a bad day love anyway when you have a bad day love any way you see when we when we go through our worst this as humans it's part of our nature we tend to wound other people around us you see we've already established that in this series that bad days are inevitable that means they're going to happen it's a normal part of life sometimes we're going to fail that test or that examine school that we studied for sometimes we're not going to make the cut after we we're not going to make the team after we spent the whole summer training getting better and conditioning sometimes we're going to receive that work that email from work whether it's from a co-worker or our boss that's just going to set us off and put us in a mood man sometimes your favorite team is gonna lose or still not have a quarterback some of y'all like what man my god help indianapolis or better yet your back your brackets busted like man but hey kentucky lost praise the lord or how about man this is me all the time when you lose your phone your keys your wallet i'm like how come nothing i need is ever where i need it when i need it and i get frustrated or how about man you're like you you're driving down the road you're like man gas prices went up again you see but seriously though you see many of us what we do i think i think it when it comes to like work we attach our worth to our work so what do you think happens when we have a bad day at work you see we or we get frustrated or what somebody offends us rubs us the wrong way what happens well we don't feel valued we don't feel important we don't feel respected and so what do we do well on your way home from work you get in the car you start driving home and you're just in one of those moods where you're like you're just waiting for something to happen you are just you are welcoming you have opened the door like man i wish somebody would cut me off in rush hour traffic on 4 65 and then when that happens you're like all right you kept it all in like you didn't go off yet but then you begin to pull into the driveway after it took you it took you an hour to get home and it's only a 30 minute commute come on somebody you pull up into the driveway to see that your kids if you have them left all their toys left their bicycles all over the front yard and you were like who raised you like what is going on right now but that didn't set you off yet so you begin to make your way towards the front door and you're like all right my spouse worked from home all day kids been home from school for a while now why are all the amazon packages still piled all the way from the bottom of the front porch to the ceiling like nobody can take the time and the energy to bring them all inside i got to do it as soon as i get home but you're good you don't have to worry you're like you didn't you didn't go off yet until finally you get to the dinner table you're ready to unwind and one of your kids accidentally bumps into the table knocks over your diet dr pepper and his spills everywhere and then you turn into the incredible hulk and you just go off some of you are like pastor andrew were you at our house the other night for family dinner because you just perfectly described how did you know y'all because we've all experienced days like that anybody ever had a day where you're like surely this cannot get any worse but then wait something happens and then a bad day gets worse but you see church family when you're having a bad day you have a choice when you're having a bad day you can either break down or you can bounce back you can break down or you can bounce back you see life sometimes it feels like a battlefield sometimes it feels like a battlefield you're not winning but you see i don't know about you i don't always want my life to feel like a battlefield i want my life to be a blessing you see that's why when we have a bad day we need to love anyway and jesus modeled this for us and we learned how to follow his example in scripture read with me in first john chapter 2 verses 5-6 the bible says but those who obey god's word truly show how completely they love him that is how we know we are living in him those who say they live in god should live their lives as jesus all right so on his worst day how did jesus respond we see that he cared for those closest to him let's look at that let's look at the text again john chapter 19 verse 26 it says that when jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved his name was john he said to her dear woman here is your son and he said this to john his disciple here is your mother so some of you might be thinking and i thought the same thing too some of you might be thinking pastor andrew why on earth did jesus call his mother woman y'all if i called my mother woman she's here today by the way if i called her woman i would have been knocked out like mama said knock you out like come on like y'all not the middle of next week the middle of next year but you see here here's what you need to understand like in our english language here 2020 to our culture like when you use the word woman it's usually like dismissive and disrespectful but you need to understand like the new testament was actually written in greek and so when you look at the word woman the way jesus uses it in the original language the bible was written the term woman actually is a term of respect it is actually a term of recognition it's like care and tenderness and you know we can't we can't forget that in genesis in the book of genesis god created man and then he created woman thank you jesus right come on god created women if you all ain't gonna amend it i will that was for you babe so for all the women out there i just want you to know like jesus is not being disrespectful and guys let me help you out this is for free in the message all right you ain't gotta pay anything for this this verse does not give you an excuse to call your mama or to call your wife woman if you wanna do that god bless you you can suffer the consequences but you see you see all seriousness even as jesus is hanging on the cross he's dying he he still fulfilled his responsibility to take care of his mother he didn't use his pain or suffering as an excuse to not do what god had called him to do you see even while suffering in agony jesus demonstrated his heart and his love for mary his mother in fact the brother of jesus james here's what he wrote in scripture james 1 27 it says that pure and genuine religion in the sight of god the father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you so jesus we see in scripture he took care of the widow even if the widow happened to be his own mother you know even jesus obeyed the ten commandments in the bible when it said honor your father and mother we see jesus honored his mother and can i tell you bad days never give you an excuse to ignore what the word of god says to do i almost say that one again bad days do not they never give us an excuse as followers of jesus to ignore the truth of god's word and some of you might be wondering well pastor andrew why didn't jesus like jesus had a biological brother james why didn't jesus ask james to take care of their mom why did he ask his disciple john to do it you see at the time james still didn't believe that his brother jesus was the son of god he's just over here kind of like you're the who could you imagine if your sibling was like hey i'm the i'm the son or daughter of god you'd be like you think you are like that's what was going on here some family drama and so be but you see because james didn't believe that jesus was who he said he was jesus decided he asked john hey will you take care of my mom well why is that important because in doing so jesus here's what jesus demonstrated he not only demonstrated the importance of our immediate family taking care of our immediate family but also the importance of the family of god you see it was establishing the family of god that was at the very heart of jesus's mission in his earthly ministry and the truth is that we cannot neglect the family of god people's church we cannot neglect the next generation even if we're having a bad day and going through it you see as parent as parents as guardians as influences we can't afford to allow our difficulties our circumstances the busyness of life all the other priorities we have we can't allow any of that to prevent us from teaching our children hey this is what it looks like to love god hey let me teach you let me train you how to follow jesus and here at people's church and we care about the next generation that's why this wednesday night we're having a fun event march madness for teenagers that's why every single sunday we have a blast our dream team serving loving on your kids teaching them about jesus and pc kids why because we want the next generation to stand strong in their faith and to live for jesus no matter what but can i tell you this church our pastors are the church leaders we're only a supplement to your leadership at best we get a few hours with your students with your kids every week they live under your roof some of y'all like pastor andrew you can take them like wednesday you can have a monday tuesday wednesday but you see in all seriousness adults you have an incredible opportunity and responsibility to prioritize your family even through difficult times especially through difficult times you are the primary pastor of your children in the home and listen i understand this like your financial pressures those are real your stress level your emotional well-being it is real your fatigue is real but can i tell you don't allow any of what you're going through don't let these things cause you to miss the very short window of opportunity you have to invest in your children while they're still young while they're still living in your home jesus on his bad day could have focused on his pain but he chose to love his family instead here's what the bible says in john chapter 1 verse 12 it says but to all who believed in him and accepted him referring to jesus he gave them the right to become children of god you see the bible tells us that when we surrender our lives and we say yes to following jesus that we are adopted into the family of god that's why here at people's church we say it we preach it we live it we practice it we are family and you see the truth is that all of us in some way desire to be a part of a family and it's because ultimately we were created by god for a need and for a desire to belong and be a part of a family and i think that's why hollywood has done such an it's like an incredibly hard job to make a lot of tv shows about the family how many of you remember the winslow family uh from that show family matters anybody grow up watching that you can raise your hand i'm not gonna like call you out in church or anything like is this a test this is a trick like man some of you can probably identify with this good-looking family right here come on how about some of you maybe you grew up watching the taylor family on home improvement come on anybody remember that show couple of ya this one's one of my favorites right here what about the the banks family come on from the fresh prince uh bel air some of y'all got the theme song going in your head while i'm preaching i ain't gonna judge you it's in my head too i'm like come on hey remix all right what about this one this is another popular one two i enjoy full house come on look at the tanner family man what a crew right there another remix man they're coming back y'all the show's coming back what about i never understood this one until somebody actually referred to my families this family what about the brady bunch all those they're like we were always called the brady bunch because my parents had four kids i'm like who on earth is the brady bunch and i saw the picture i was like oh that's why we are called the brady buds and what about this is a popular one i think all of us most of us enjoy what about the pearson family from this that y'all want to get in your feelings man i can't tell you how many times i'm scrolling through facebook it's like y'all did you see do y'all see that episode from this is us this weekend come on nbc what's up what's up you know maybe you identify with some of these families but then there's some of you are like man pastor andrew i don't relate to any of these families well maybe this family is more relatable to you what about the adams family come on you talking about a family picture y'all don't be like pointing at you at your spouse or your siblings saying hey that's who you are right there you see every family every family ha it looks a little dysfunctional doesn't it there's no such thing as a perfect family if we're being 100 honest with each other some of you are like pastor andrew what do you mean a little dysfunctional like i come from a capital d dysfunctional family you know i know what i'm saying some of you like capital d like all caps dysfunctional family and you see dysfunctional or not though guess what we love each other anyway why because we're family we're family and you see when we have a bad day you know who who normally gets the worst of it yeah our family gets the worst of it and the truth is we reveal who we really are we reveal our true selves to our families why because they get to see the best of us and the worst of us y'all if you want to know who someone really is ask their parents ask their spouse ask their kids ask their siblings who they really are because they've seen you lose your temper on family vacation like y'all didn't even get the luggage in the van you going you biting each other's heads off like they saw you go off go at each other's throats during monopoly night like that's a real one right there that my family knows what's up some of y'all like they've seen they've seen your meltdown at thanksgiving and at christmas like they know better than anybody isn't it funny too none of that ever makes it on social media like what you see on your worst day when you're having a bad day you choose to love anyway why because your family we choose to love anyway even when you don't feel like it some of you are like i have to love you but i don't like you right now see i always think it's awesome you can get one of those signs that says family rules or house rules and hang it up in your house and i know most of us if we're being honest that's not a legitimate set of rules we just use it for decoration and then break every single rule on it but for the sake of this message and because you know we love the lord let's let's just pretend and imagine like we actually have some family rules some of them might say you know in this house during this family we always tell the truth or we always say we love each other we often or we use kind words we hug often we always give our best you know while jesus was on the cross he didn't just emphasize the importance of family but he also established some family rules we need to follow so let's look at this verse in matthew 22 verses 37 through 39 when jesus was asked what are the family rules what's the greatest command jesus said you must love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment a second is equally important love your neighbor as yourself so today i want to break down this verse very quickly give you three quick family rules we need to follow on good days and bad days as followers of jesus the first one is this we love big we love big to love someone or something with all your heart your soul your strength y'all that is big and whenever we have a bad day we don't fight back we love back we love big and i know it's hard when you're having a bad day but love anyway why because on his worst day jesus chose to love us anyway what does it mean to love big the bible says in first corinthians 13 verses 4 through 7 a very popular passage about what love is it says love is patient and kind it's not jealous or boastful or proud or rude it does not demand its own way it's not irritable it keeps no record of being wrong it does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out love never gives up love never loses faith is always hopeful and endures through every circumstance man i would a challenge and encourage you to ask yourself a series of questions man am i patient am i kind i imagine most of us we think we're good at love and big but then man am i irritable am i proud am i rude take it a step further man ask someone close to you hey am i patient am i kind do i love like jesus what does it mean to love big what does it mean to love like jesus the bible says first john 4 8 anyone who does not love god or does not love does not know god wife because god is love first peter 4 8 most important of all continue to show deep love for each other for love covers a multitude of sins romans 12 10 love each other with genuine affection and take delight in honoring each other ephesians 4 2 always be humble and gentle be patient with each other making allowance for each other's faults because of your love and uh last verse john 13 35 the words of jesus he said your love for one another will prove to the world you're my disciples not your church attendance not if you served on a dream team not if you how much you gave in the offering not what what you put on social media the bible your bi your streak on the bible app said the way you love people the way you treat people when you're having a bad day that's how the world will know you are my disciples so we love big the second family rule number two is this we give back you see in a world we live in a world that's always taking always receiving but we're called as the family of god to give back and when you choose to give back it will actually help you to bounce back we know that most of us know the bible verse john 3 16 it says for god this is how god loved the world how did he demonstrate it he gave his one and only son that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life you see love is most powerfully demonstrated through the act of generosity and when you're having a bad day it's easy to make life all about us and what we're going through but we need to remember on his worst day jesus chose to give back i love what the bible says acts 20 verse 35 says and i have been a constant example of how you can help those in need by working hard and then he says you should remember the words of the lord jesus he said it is more blessed to give than to receive and the reality is jesus gave the greatest sacrifice that any human could have ever given in giving up his own life for humanity but you see you can give back today simply with just your smile your time your attention your resources your talent you can get on a dream team and serve every single sunday you can get involved in growth track we have a growth track class every single sunday 11 a.m 12 30 p.m to help you get connected involved in our church why do we want why do we need to give back because the bible says in proverbs 11 25 the generous will prosper those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed sometimes our thinking is backwards we think man i don't i can't give what i don't have or i don't have enough to give but the bible says those who refresh others they themselves will be refreshed it's about giving back and i know when you're having a bad day it's hard to give back but that's why when we're having a bad day we do need to give back because helping others it helps you helping others helps you and when you need to bounce back just make a decision to give back i'm reminded of the story when jesus told the good told of the good samaritan the two two jewish church leaders walked by this man who's been beaten and left for dead and the good samaritan the hated rival of the jewish nation comes by and he helps the man and jesus says now who do you think was a good neighbor to this man and saved his life and the man replied to jesus verse 37 the man replied well the one who showed him mercy obviously and jesus said yeah you're right now you go and do the same you see your bounce back can come from actually helping others and i think we need to listen to the words of jesus and follow in his footsteps today now go and do the same here's the third and final rule i'll give you today and then i'll close number three you see not only do we love big not only do we give back but number three we don't give up we're family we don't give up jesus didn't give up on his family and neither should we and i want you to know today that if you're alive and breathing man there's still time on the clock and it's not too late for you to seek forgiveness it's not too late for you to forgive it's not too late for you to try to reconcile and restore that relationship with your parent or with your sibling or that family member can i tell you don't give up praying for that prodigal son or daughter who's left your home maybe you raised them in church you trained them in the ways of jesus but then they made their own decision and they ran off they used to know god but they're running while living their own way now and you've been praying for him you've been fasting for him it seems like nothing's changed nothing's gotten better and you're discouraged and you're ready to throw in the towel today man can i tell you don't stop loving them big don't stop giving back don't give up praying believing and hoping for them because you can still love big you can give back you can still bounce back today i've told this story before but i'm a follower of jesus today as a young man and a pastor in ministry all because of a praying great grandfather you know my my father grew up in church both my parents did but weren't followers of jesus and my great-grandpa made a decision man i'm gonna pray i'm gonna fast i'm gonna keep loving my family until they come to know jesus i remember he was just and he drove a trash truck his whole life was a greeter y'all he would have killed it on the first impressions team best greeter i've ever seen give you a bear hug like squeeze the life out of you but every preacher that came to this church he'd write down my parents name on a piece of paper give it to him and say hey these are my grandchildren will you pray for him man god has a purpose for their life they need to know jesus he kept praying and praying and praying and praying for years until finally my parents said yes to jesus and they became followers of jesus but can i tell you today that those prayers because he made the decision i'm not going to give up i'm going to stay persistent i'm going to keep loving them big i'm going to keep giving i'm going to keep serving i'm going to keep living for jesus i'm going to keep praying and believing his prayers didn't just change his grandparent or his grandchildren's lives but it changed his great grandchildren's life son someday lord willing i have children and i have grandchildren guess what i'm believing today they're going to know jesus and it all starts from that great praying great grandfather you see church family be encouraged today to know that your prayers matter you're you're loving your family where they are meeting them where they are it matters and it makes a difference don't give up make a decision i'm not gonna be denied i refuse to quit give up throw in the towel on my family i refuse to let the devil win because of a bad day i'm gonna love big i'm gonna give back and i won't give up and this is what i know the bible says when we were at our worst jesus loved us anyway today when i'm still at my worst when i fall short when i miss the mark jesus loves me anyway he loves us big he always gives back he never gives up on us and that means when you're having a bad day even if you're having a bad year and you feel like you're going through it you can bounce back because he loved you anyway he died for you anyway he wants to change your life anyway i believe today there's some of us who man we're carrying a lot of weight today the heaviness of life we feel like we're carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders and i believe today that jesus wants nothing more than to just lift that weight off of you and set you free because here's what i know it's hard to bounce back when you feel like you're at rock bottom it's hard to bounce back when you're carrying all that weight but i believe today that if you'll call on jesus that weight that spirit of heaviness will be released and you'll bounce back

news I want to share with you some good news from the Bible Luke chapter 2 verse 8 through 10. it says there were some Shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night an angel of the Lord appeared to them in the glory of the Lord Shone around them and they were terrified but the angel said to them do not be afraid I bring good news that will cause great joy for all the people everybody say good news the angel shows up and he knows that the Shepherds could be scared by what they're seeing and so the angel says do not be afraid some of you need to hear this today in spite of what you see in and around you do not be afraid I know you see the family pain but do not be afraid the Friendship drama do not be afraid the stress at work do not be afraid the interest rates do not be afraid the inflation do not be afraid the wars do not be afraid the division and hatred in our world do not be afraid the flu coven and other sickness do not be afraid do not become gripped by fear because of what you see do not be afraid there was a word from the angel to the Shepherds and it's a word for you today the angel goes on to say I have good news how many of you know that not all news is good news you know I mean like sometimes it feels like most news is bad news and we live in a day and time where technology with our smartphones just notifications just just popping up and just seems like bad news after bad news matter of fact some of you you got excited yesterday you were out shopping and you got a notification and it says the Indianapolis Colts are winning 33-0 at halftime oh praise the Lord man the Cults are back baby and so you went and you got your caramel brulee latte and you were sipping it and feeling good doing some Christmas shopping and then an hour or so later your phone started buzzing again oh oh you had to go on another app to look at you thought you were being pranked and they lost bad news and I think we all can relate we get that text message maybe that phone call at a strange time and we get bad news they can just feel like all the news the breaking news it's bad news we're so used to receiving bad news matter of fact some of you have received bad news this year I know I have maybe a family member close friend passed away maybe lost your job or relationship ended maybe received a bad doctor's report or you got some bad news about your grades your child your car bad news is everywhere we turn but the angel says I have good news Luke 2 11 today in the town of David a savior has been born to you he is the Messiah the Lord the birth of Christ is good news everybody say good news it's the best news you could ever receive the real meaning of Christmas is all about the good news of Jesus let me tell you why Jesus being born is good news number one is this it brings great joy look at Luke 2 10. it says but the angel said to them do not be afraid I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people did you realize that God wants you to have great joy not just a little Joy some Joy great joy God doesn't want you living depressed and anxious and angry and constantly frustrated never smiling no Jesus was born so that you could live a life of great joy the Bible says I bring good news that will cause great joy for all the people but Jesus being born doesn't automatically bring great joy to everyone see the joy is available for everyone who trusts Jesus with their life great joy comes from having a relationship with God through his son Jesus the good news is this the bad news you receive in this world doesn't have to stop you from having Joy you can have joy in the midst of the bad news you can have joy in the midst of the sorrow joy in the midst of Death Joy in the midst of loss joy in the midst of struggle joy in the midst of disappointment because your joy isn't predicated on the type of news you receive Joy is predicated on Jesus Joy comes from Jesus the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away okay Joy is from Jesus the angel said great joy it brings great joy number two number two let me share with you let me tell you why Jesus being born is good news is number two a savior was born Luke 2 11 it says today in the town of David a savior has been born to you he is the messiah the Lord Jesus being born is such good news because a savior was born we all need a savior none of us are perfect we've all made mistakes and our mistakes and our sin it separates us from God there was a gap between humanity and God and so God sent Jesus to bridge the gap between God and man look at Ephesians chapter 2 verse one through five it says as for you you were dead in your transgressions and sins in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient all of us also lived among them at one time gratifying the Cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts like the rest we were by Nature deserving of Wrath but because of his great love for us God who is rich in Mercy made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions It Is by Grace you have been saved all of us need to be saved from our sin and so a savior was born we're not hopeless the good news is we don't have to stay dead in our sin we don't have to stay separated from God God loves us so much and is so rich in Mercy that He sent Jesus to be born to take care of our sin problem that's good news a savior was born and he saves us from our sins this is good news let me give you the third reason that Jesus being born is good news number three it's for all people it's for all people Luke 2 10 and 11 it says but the angel said to them do not be afraid I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people today in the town of David a savior has been born to you he is the messiah the Lord as I've been preaching this message today some of you have been processing is this good news really for me I know it's for other people but it can't be for me I know all of my failures all of my mistakes all of my sins God can't possibly be talking to me I'm disqualified from this good news I'm not worthy of this good news but the Bible says this good news is for all people a savior was born to you it doesn't matter what you've done it doesn't matter all of your mistakes it doesn't matter all about your failures the good news about God's love Grace Hope and forgiveness of sins is it's for all people and it's for you Jesus was born for you Jesus died on the cross for you Jesus rose again on the third day for you Christmas is all about the good news of Jesus the Savior was born for all people a savior was born to you to save you from your sins look at First Timothy chapter 1 verse 15. it says here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am the word first Jesus was born to save all people from their sins Jesus was born so that all people could be forgiven of their sins so that all people could have a relationship with God so that all people can live with God in heaven for all of eternity Jesus was born to save you from your sin God gave you a free gift his son Jesus Jesus is a free gift for you a savior was born for all people a savior was born for you all you have to do is receive the free gift of Jesus every year there's a Christmas play at Jackson Elementary School everyone looks forward to the play every year matter of fact the whole town comes out for the play and at Jackson Elementary School there's a kid named Sydney Sydney's active always moving can't stay still come on you know what Sydney and the Christmas

QwSyohM8Dyk,[Applause] man people search thank you so much can we keep our hands going for jesus today come on he's really why we're here he's awesome amen well church family it's truly an honor and a privilege to have this opportunity to preach the word of god to you today as always i do just want to take a quick moment to honor pastor chris and pastor jamie smith even in their absence i'm just thankful and want to honor them for their obedience to the calling of god on their life to lead our church and to make a difference here in the city of indianapolis and we're truly blessed as a church and i'm just thankful uh thank god for our pastors today church family last sunday was commitment sunday here at people's church where we all made our giving commitments for dream builders 2000 and 2022 as most of you probably know we are looking to buy a building and or purchase land sometime next year because we are growing and god is moving in our church and so our dream builders commitment is going to support that and then it also just helps us be able to support missions here locally also nationally and even internationally around the world and so we wanted you to know that even though commitment sunday was last sunday it is still not too late to make your commitment if you're still interested but haven't done it you've been praying considering it you can fill out a commitment card today and as you leave service just like you would with the offering you can drop it off in one of the black boxes however if you're a little tech savvy and you'd like to do it online you most certainly can you can do it online through the people's church website you can even believe it or not do it through the people's church app on your phone as well and then next sunday here at people's church is our annual miracle offering and church family i just want to challenge and encourage all of us to come excited to come ready to bring our best offering and i don't know about you but i'm just i'm excited and i can't wait to see everything that god is going to do in 2022 because of our ridiculous faith and our ridiculous generosity how many of you believe today god is moving in our church couple of you all right hey i know 2021 has had its ups it's had its downs and it's been quite a year but man god has done historical things in our church through our church this year in 2021 historical things that have never happened in our six years together as a church and hey we believe the best is yet to come god has not done with us yet we're just getting started and these are exciting times here at people's church amen amen well church family if you're here today that means you survived your family thanksgiving come on hey pat yourself on the back congratulations i'm not going to ask anybody if you're wearing stretchy pants in the house of the gods today uh because that's none of my business that's between you and the lord but in all seriousness i hope that you enjoyed uh thanksgiving this year and that you were able to spend some quality time with your family your friends and your loved ones maybe even the people you don't like uh i'm not gonna get into all that but i know for for me personally uh thanksgiving this year was special and you in in a unique way uh because it's actually it was the last thanksgiving i'll ever have to spend as a young single man hey not even preaching yet come on somebody yes that's right because next year the lovely miss jessica miller and i we will be sharing thanksgiving together as husband and wife not just next year either forever come on next august y'all oh yeah we got an engagement picture come on man man she good looking that's all i'm going to say i'm not going to get into all of it yet because we ain't married yet but man i'm excited y'all i'm excited for marriage excited to do life forever with my beautiful best friend but hey you all need to be praying for us because we ain't even married yet and we got some pretty serious conflict between her and i now she's i don't see her in the room but she was just on stage with the worship team so if she comes out to try to tackle me y'all help me out or like he deserves it hey have at it girl but you see i won't get into too many details cause she's here and obviously i'm preaching from the pulpit but what this conflict all comes down to without naming any names she one of us one of us believes has two different theologies all right one of us believes it is acceptable and appropriate to begin celebrating and decorating for christmas before thanksgiving while the other individual who loves the lord is following his word being led by the spirit believes that you don't begin the christmas festivities until after thanksgiving has come and gone because that's what jesus would do like give us a scripture for that i got a scripture yet but i'm working on it all right all right we're going to settle this right now who here before thanks before thursday you had your christmas stuff up oh we're going to pray for you saxon come to the piano man we're going to get this altar called all right where okay so who you honestly raise your hand you got the christmas spirit you're like yeah we we done did this before thanksgiving all right all right raise your hand if you have the holy spirit and you waited until after after thanksgiving yeah god's chosen people come on come on hey hey all seriousness whether you waited till before or after hey god loves you all right god is for you he is on your side but man you see what jess and i we drove by this house the other day they had their uh fall decorations up and their christmas decorations up at the same time she goes who would do that that looks awful i said it's called compromise i said you know what i said their yard and their house looks awful i said but i bet their marriage is good like hey if anyone needs prayer today it's gonna be me all right i still need to be engaged after service today so we start marriage counseling in january so y'all pray for a breakthrough man because she's winning this conflict right now man last week we finished a sermon series called ridiculous which is what i have been up here for the last few minutes and man when i say the word ridiculous now i'm not talking about um celebrating christmas before thanksgiving ridiculous not that kind of ridiculous some of y'all like you better get to preaching when i say ridiculous i'm talking about having the kind of faith that believes god is able and willing to do more in our lives than we could ever possibly think or imagine regardless of the circumstances we're experiencing the kind of faith that believes god can and god will do things in my life that others would say is impossible or what some may even say is ridiculous and as followers of jesus i want you to know today not only are we called by god to live a life of ridiculous faith but we are also called by god to live a life of ridiculous thankfulness ridiculous thankfulness pastor andrew we just celebrated thanksgiving it came gone it's done why why are you preaching a message about being thankful today you see although we live in a culture unfortunately where being thankful has been devalued to just be nothing more than merely a holiday we observe once a year and then we move on with the rest of our lives but you see the bible tells us that being thankful is something so much more than that it's more than one day a year being thankful god tells us in his word in fact that being thankful is supposed to be our lifestyle as followers of jesus look with me in the bible what the apostle paul wrote in first thessalonians 5 18 he wrote be thankful in all circumstances somebody say all all circumstances for this is god's will this is what god wants for you who belong to christ jesus and if we're really like really really being honest with each other today what the apostle paul wrote in this verse is ridiculous how or how is it humanly possible to be thankful in all circumstances especially the bad ones how am i supposed to be thankful when i lost my job i got laid off it's real how am i supposed to be thankful when i just wrecked my car and i don't know how i'm gonna get one to replace it how am i supposed to be thankful when i got a bad report from the doctor and it's not looking like it's gonna get any better how am i supposed to be thankful when i lost a loved one who was near and dear to me how am i supposed to be thankful when the divorce just got finalized how am i supposed to be thankful in the midst of my circumstances because it it seems like every day the world is constantly reminding you and me of how bad our circumstances are whether you turn on the news you get on social media there's always going to be a reminder of how rough life can be even though the reality is whether you're a follower of jesus or not the reality is that we still have more reasons than we can count to be thankful even if it seems ridiculous look at what the psalmist wrote psalm chapter 9 verse 1. i love what he says i will give thanks to the lord with my whole heart i will recount all your wonderful deeds you see what i want you to notice is that in this verse there is a sense of extreme ownership notice he says he says i will give thanks and it's that extreme ownership that you and i are called to live with as a follower of jesus you see can i tell you today we may not always be able to choose our circumstances but we can always choose our attitude you see we can't always control our circumstances but we can always control our gratitude we can either be hateful about what's going on in our lives or we can be grateful about what's going on in our lives and that's that's so important church family because the fact of the matter is the level of our gratitude will always determine the level of how close we can get to god in other words the more grateful you are the closer to the presence of god you will become and i don't know about you but the more challenging that my life gets as i continue to get older and experienced in life the more and more and more i keep recognizing that i need to be closer to the presence of god now more than i ever have been before and that's why even in the middle of our hardship and our circumstances we need to have a posture that says no matter what my circumstances are i will give thanks for the next few moments today i just like to draw our focus and our attention to a specific story from scripture found in the old testament daniel chapter 6 and i'll give you some quick context before we jump into the story there's a jewish man named daniel living a place called babylon where the nation of israel has been in exile now in daniel and his people they were taken captive and forced to live in a foreign land to serve as slaves to the babylonians against their own will and over time scripture records that daniel uniquely stood out from everyone else not only in his own nation of israel but also out of everyone else in the nation of babylon in fact the bible literally says that he found favor with darius the king of babylon and he was given a place of extremely high leadership in the kingdom but with that favor came a lot of haters so there were many babylonian officials who were growing jealous of daniel and they decided they were going to scheme a plan to take him down so let's pick up in daniel chapter 6 verse 4. here's what the story how the story continues the bible says then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way daniel was handling government affairs but they couldn't find anything to criticize or condemn he was faithful always responsible and completely trustworthy so they concluded our only chance of finding grounds for accusing daniel will be in connection with the rules of his religion so the administrators and high officers went to the king and said long live king darius we are all in agreement we administrators officials high officers advisers and governors that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced give orders that for the next 30 days any person who prays to anyone divine or human except to you your majesty will be thrown into the den of lions and now your majesty issue and sign this law so that it cannot be changed an official law of the medes and persians that cannot be revoked so king darius signed the law but verse 10 is where i really want us to zoom in and focus on today verse 10 so it says king darius signs this law verse 10 but when daniel learned that the law had been signed what did he do he went home and knelt down as usual in his upstairs room with his hit its windows open toward jerusalem he prayed three times a day just as he had always done giving thanks to his god y'all you want to talk about ridiculous daniel daniel could have complained daniel could have allowed his fear the uncertainty and the risk of his situation to keep him silent i mean knowing the reality that he could be killed by lions mean scary man eating lions king of the jungle i'm not talking about the detroit lions y'all some of y'all got that the rest of you forget it it's sports it don't mean nothing to you see daniel is going to be fed to these lions for praying but what does he do anyways the bible says he does something ridiculous he prays and he gives thanks to god my friend i don't know what you're facing today but what i do want you to know is that god's will for your life is to be thankful and to give thanks in every season of your life and in every situation regardless of your circumstances even if it seems ridiculous so today i want to share with you how to live with ridiculous thanksgiving how do we do that today you see we live with ridiculous thanks giving and thankfulness whenever we number one give thanks for what god has done we give thanks for what god has done i don't know how much you know about the story of daniel but if you go back to the first five chapters you'll quickly discover daniel has a history and a track record with god so daniel looked back in his life chapter one god gave him favor when he refused to eat the king's meat and to live according to that culture and then you skip a few chapters over to daniel chapter three there's three guys three friends of daniel some of us are familiar with shadrach meshach abednego god literally saves them from a blazing fiery furnace so daniel's looking back at chapter after chapter leading up to the story like man i got a lot to be thankful for god's really come through for me my family daniel even in the middle of life and death circumstances he is looking back over his life and thanking god for everything he's done for him i love what psalm 34 says in verses 1-3 the writer said i will always thank the lord i will never stop praising him i will praise him for what he has done may all who are oppressed and oppressed listen and be glad proclaim with me the lord's greatness let us praise his name together i remember here uh recently as jessica and i have been planning a wedding and uh you know working through engagement trying to figure out what this next season of life next year is a married couple's going to look like there have been uh different decisions we're trying to make for the future where man we're trying to be smart strategic and wise but then we also we want to be led by the holy spirit we want to have ridiculous faith and we want god to lead us and we want to honor god with every decision and so there was this one decision in particular we've been trying to figure out and we're kind of on the verge of like man do we still keep trying to stay positive with this and have faith or like man it's like how are we going to make this work it's easy to get discouraged right now and so a few weeks ago i was just driving and kind of praying and thinking about the situation and like i've ever been in the car in the holy spirit just like smack you in the face with something like that ever happens to you just keep two hands on the wheel ten and two keep going don't don't get in a car wreck and they ask you what happened be like it was the holy spirit don't blame god for your problems all right but i was driving and as i'm praying and just trying to think through this situation or this decision i was reminded of a time in my life where early on in college my car broke down and i was in a unique situation where i could not financially afford to replace my vehicle and to keep getting through school i remember being frustrated because i was like god you called me in the ministry you told me to do online school which online school to go through like you got me going down this crazy path i followed you every single step and now i'm in this crossroads where i feel like i have to choose one or the other i remember being frustrated huffing and puffing i'm trying to figure it all out myself and it was like every door was closed i exhausted every option nothing happened i remember sitting on the couch that night and i slammed my laptop with my laptop down and i was just i was frustrated i had had enough and i just remember hearing like that that still small voice of the holy spirit saying andrew do you trust me i was like what do you mean do you trust me like sure you know and it was like do you do you genuinely believe that i will take care of you i was like you know god god i think so yeah it's like andrew here's what i want you to do okay put the laptop down go upstairs go to your room go to sleep it's like whatever so i go upstairs and sure enough i slept and i remember waking up that next morning and i came downstairs i got a phone call from my dad it's rare he calls me on the phone like that especially in the morning and answer the phone i'm like is everything okay he's like is everything okay he's like son he's like i was praying this morning that god would provide you a vehicle and so you could keep pursuing ministry and going to school and he said i couldn't even get done praying i got a phone call from a buddy he was like hey man uh i got this car that i'm trying to get rid of it's in great shape new tires the whole nine yards i just like i just felt like i was supposed to call you and see if you needed it or wanted it and i just kind of stood back like man look at god you know and so as i was driving just a few weeks ago and the holy spirit just kind of hit me with that story you know i stopped what i was doing i wasn't even praying about that situation anymore i stopped and had just like a two-minute praise break in the middle of my car and was like god i remember when you took care of me before i remember when i didn't have it and i couldn't make it work you showed up you took care of it all and then i began to think about time and time again before and after that where i was like man that was god god did this for me you see what happens is hopefully everybody's got one of these in their car if you don't you should get one i'm trying to help you out but you see the purpose of the rear view mirror is it's in front of you but it's to show you what's behind you and i wonder today if you'll just look back if you'll look in the rear view mirror of your life what do you see are you just gonna see what went wrong what didn't go your way are you gonna look in the rearview mirror of your life and be bitter and be hateful and just live in regret are you gonna choose to look in the rearview mirror of your life and be like oh yeah god did take care of that oh yeah god did take care of that bill oh yeah god did heal that family member oh yeah god did give me that job god did give me that opportunity you see what do you look at when you look in the rear view mirror of your life are you thankful you see when we look in the rear view mirror of our life what we need to see is the fact that time and time again god has provided god has been present god has protected us today he saved our soul from eternity in hell he's healed our body he set us free from addiction he's restored broken marriages and it's because of what god has done when we reflect our hearts can't help but be full and overflow with gratitude when i look in the rearview mirror of people's church man god has done so much for us six years ago pastor chris pastor jamie moved from oklahoma city started this campus in fall creek valley middle school just a little bit of people now look at where we at where we're at today god is moving in our church there's lives being changed there there's marriages being restored there are communities being impacted and i want you to know today that even in spite of the pain and the heartache you see and remember when you look in the rearview mirror of your life the truth is you can thank god for all the stuff that didn't go your way you're like pastor andrew why would i thank god for the hurt the pain the rejection that's ridiculous yeah it is ridiculous it's called ridiculous thankfulness you see when you can look back through the pain through the hurt and all the trouble you can still see man you know what this did happen to me but god still kept his promise yeah that didn't turn out the way i wanted it to but god was still faithful you see when it's important as followers of jesus that we look in the rearview mirror and reflect on everything god has done for us so number one we give thanks for what god has done number two we give thanks for what god is doing we give thanks for what god is doing you see even in the middle of captivity and oppression daniel had a lot to be thankful for because there was so much that god was doing presently in his life at that moment even in captivity he's still out of home even as a slave he still had breath in his lungs and plenty of food to eat he even found favor with the king over the nation that enslaved them because ultimately he had the favor of god over his life really quickly let's look at psalm 95 verses 2-3 the bible says let us come into his presence with thanksgiving let us make a joyful noise to him with songs to praise for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods so the bible says that in all circumstances we need to run into the presence of god with a heart of thankfulness can i tell you today some of you you need to stop running into fear you need to stop running into anxiety you need to stop running into doubt and then to worry you you're stuck in your despair and your discouragement and in your depression my friend if you're gonna run anywhere or to somebody when trouble and tragedy strikes you might as well run directly into the presence of god with a heart that is thankful and grateful i love what the bible says in psalm 92 look with me what it says the bible says it is good to complain to the lord hold up it is good to give up on the lord hold up what translation is that it is good to give thanks to the lord to sing praises to the most high the bible says it is good to proclaim your unfailing love in the morning and your faithfulness in the evening come on it doesn't matter if you're on the mountain or in the valley give thanks today because his love is unfailing it doesn't matter if you're sick if you're tired or if you're sick and tired give thanks because his faithfulness endures forever they see church family when you when you look in the mirror when you look at the mirror of your life and see everything happening right here in front of you in the present moment in this season of your life let me ask you are you thankful see i feel like somebody would be like pastor andrew i'm looking in the smear i don't like what i see wrinkles wish i had more hair pimples you see i think it's it's easy for all of us when we look into the mirror of what's happening in our lives at the present moment the easy thing to do is to pick out all the imperfections and everything we don't like but let me let me persuade you with this what if what you're looking at taking place in your life right now you see is imperfect but god sees it as a masterpiece sometimes god wants us to embrace the messiness of our lives and the things we can't control to help us see that even when we don't have authority or control every over everything god is still no matter what we're going through working and doing something in our lives in this present moment it's not just something he did in the past but he's working today and i don't know about you but when i look at the mirror of my life right now i'm thankful for what god is doing in my life y'all god could have called and equipped literally anybody else on the face of the planet to be the student pastor here at people's church in the city of indianapolis and i don't know why god chose me but all i know is that he chose me and i'm thankful that he chose me because god is doing something special here at people search he's doing something special in our youth ministry y'all i'm the youth pastor and i got the microphone so i'ma say it if you got teenagers middle school high school man get them here on wednesday nights because god is doing something in the next generation right now here today in this very location uh pastor andrew my student doesn't want to go make them go you're their parents i didn't have a choice growing up and guess what i'm a youth pastor to this day and i love being a christian i love being a pastor you see god what god is doing is so special and we want your family we want your student to be part of it i find myself saying god i don't know why you picked a 22 year old kid from greenwood that no one's ever heard of but i'm thankful that you anointed and appointed me for this house for this ministry for such a time as this god didn't earn it because i was talented or good enough i earned it because you were good and you love blessing us are you thankful today he's still providing for you are you thankful he's still with you watching over you and protecting you are you thankful today that he's still doing a work in your life so he can do a work through your life the bible says this maybe you're here today and you say pastor andrew i don't know if i have any reason to be thankful for what's going on in my life right now psalm 118 verse 24 it says this this is the day the lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it this is the day come on sunday today sunday november 28th 2021 is the day that the lord has made my friend if you got nothing else to be thankful for in your life why don't you just go on and thank god that you got the gift of today because if you woke up this morning with breath in your body that means god is not done with you yet he's still writing the chat next chapter of your story he still has a purpose he is trying to fulfill through your life he has a hope and a future in store for you be thankful for today even if it seems ridiculous so ridiculous thankfulness is when we give thanks for what god has done it's also when we give thanks for what god is doing and lastly it's when we give thanks for what god is going to do give thanks for what god is going to do daniel chapter 6 it tells us after the law was signed daniel went to his home he went upstairs to his room and the bible says that he opened his window and i wonder today how many of us are here and we look at the present state and condition of our culture we look at everything going on in our world all the bitterness all the hatred all the malice all the division all the unrest we look at it what's happening right now and we wonder what does the future hold for our country what does the future hold for the world what does the future hold for the church what's the future holding for me i think a lot of times we can look out the window of our life and become fearful anxious and depressed about our future and sometimes here's what we do we end up shutting the window we close the blinds we stay hidden in our fear and our insecurity and in our uncertainty but the bible says daniel didn't do any of that even in captivity even about to be thrown into a den of lions the bible says what does he do he opens the window daniel open the window and i don't have time to unpack all this today but scripture reveals he daniel opened the window and he faced towards jerusalem and i believe as as he was praying daniel knew god it might not be today it probably won't be tomorrow either but god i know that you keep your promises and god that's why i know we won't be slaves here in babylon forever because one day one day jerusalem will be restored it will be our home again god there's coming a day where every promise you have made to us you're going to fulfill it what i want you to know today is that you don't have to fear or be anxious about the future but you can open the window of your life and you can look out toward the future and be thankful for what god is going to do pastor andrew but i don't know what my future holds that's okay because we know who holds the future [Music] you ever wondered you know there's a reason in your car why your windshield is bigger than your mirrors because what's in front of you is bigger than what's behind you come on when you you can look ahead towards your future and say god i don't know what's going to happen i don't know how it's all going to work out but i know that you're sovereign i know that you're in control i know what your promises are for me the bible says in first chronicles 16 34 give thanks to the lord for he is good his faithful love endures forever and it says the same thing again psalm 136 verse 4 give thanks to him who alone does mighty miracles his faithful love endures forever it's so important to look in the rearview mirror of your life and thank god for what he's done for you it's important to even look at the mirror and see everything god's doing in your life right now and say thank you but sometimes what we really need to do is we need to take a step of faith forward and say god i know you haven't done it yet but i know that you're going to because you said you would and lord i just want to say thank you before it even happens god thank you for keeping your promise and i know it seems ridiculous but remember jesus said blessed are those who have believed yet they haven't seen it yet people church god has done so much for us in the past there's so much he's doing right now in the present but there's still so much more he's going to do in the future come on there's going to be more campuses in oklahoma and indiana we're going to put campuses in states that don't have a people's church campus yet we're going to reach more people than we ever have before we're going to raise up children teenagers and students to become lifelong committed followers of jesus who will change the world and make a difference for the kingdom of god i want you to know today if god said it he will do it and i'm thankful for the future of people's church one last verse i want to share with you today is one of my favorites in all scripture hebrews chapter 13 verse 8 the bible says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so when i look in the rearview mirror i see god was faithful when i look in the mirror and see what's happening in front of me i see god is still faithful but when i look out the window to observe a future i can't see i still say god is still going to be faithful and we're called to be thankful because our god is faithful as followers of jesus i want you to know today we always have hope and as long as we have hope no matter our circumstances we always have a reason to be thankful no matter if it seems ridiculous i want you to know today that this is the presence of god is in this place his spirit is moving speaking to us through his word in this moment i feel like there's just somebody here today god's message to you personally today is this [Music] don't shut the window don't keep your window shut open your window look forward look ahead to your future with hope and with thanksgiving open your window and begin to give thanks for what god is going to do in your life because as followers of jesus we're called to live with ridiculous thankfulness we praise god we thank god for what he's done what he's doing what he's still going to do at this moment i want to ask every head about every eye closed i understand today that it's extremely challenging to be thankful in difficult circumstances when we don't have a personal relationship with jesus but i want you to know today that god loves you so much that his son jesus left heaven and came to earth [Music] lived a perfect sinless life and then died of death he didn't deserve so that you and i could live a good life and live forever i want you to know the first step to learning how to be thankful in all of your circumstances is simply to surrender your heart and life to jesus so today i just i want to give everyone an opportunity to experience the love and hope of jesus this love and hope that enables us to be thankful no matter what if you're here today and you say pastor andrew i need to surrender my heart and my life to jesus i need to accept him as my lord and my savior personally while every head is bowed every eye closed today i'm gonna count to three and when i say three i simply just want you to raise your hand i'm not gonna call you out or embarrass you but as you raise your hand today i just wanna lead you in a prayer as you make a decision to live for jesus today so i'm going to count to three and when i say three if that's you just raise your hand one two three that's you just raise your hand awesome i see that hand i see that hand awesome god bless you god bless you yes i see that here too thank you thank you thank you today i i'm just going to lead you in a prayer i want you to know this decision you're making it's the most important decision you'll ever make in your life heaven is rejoicing and god is so proud of you and right now i just want to lead you in a prayer and as i pray this prayer out loud i want you to pray in your heart and believe it as you make the decision today to follow jesus god thank you for sending your son jesus into this world god i admit that i'm a sinner i've done things that are wrong and i'm guilty of falling short of your standards and lord i'm sorry today i ask for forgiveness

chapter 3 verse 20 it says now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us this one verse is power packed God is able come on how many yall know God is able He's Able he is able to do far more than you can even think or ask what have you been praying about what have you been asking God to do in your life what have you

from addiction more Miracles more people filled with the Holy Spirit more people baptized more campuses to launch to see more changed lives People's Church is 22 years old and we're just getting started God has so much more The Best Is Yet To Come God has more and we want to share with you about the more that God has for us check out this video this is the most exciting season season in the history of our church it's a season of praying and preparing for the more that God has for our church it's amazing to look back at the faithfulness and favor of God upon our church since we first started on May 12th 2002 I Remember When Tiffany and I were living in Springfield Missouri and the Lord spoke these words to our hearts I'm calling you to start a diverse church we stepped out in bold faith and moved to Oklahoma City without any details at all I remember sharing the vision of people's Church to 65 people who showed up on that first Sunday at the AMC theater in the quell Springs mall in Oklahoma City I said we're going to be a diverse church that reaches thousands of people one day I remember how we were outgrowing the AMC theater and God gave us a Vision to reach more people our 2-year-old Church did a spiritual journey campaign and everyone prayed stepped out in bold faith and gave generously we purchased this land on Britain Road built our first permanent home and grew exponentially I remember growing to five services in that 18,000 ft building one thing that's always been true at People's Church is every time we've added seats God has added souls and we were busting at the seams but we knew this was just the beginning the heartbeat of people's church has always been for those who are not here yet so together we prayed trusted God and gave sacrificially and we expanded the building on Britain Road and added a 1500 seat Auditorium and as soon as we added the additional space we grew exponentially and saw thousands of people come to faith in Christ every time we've at its seats God at its Souls but we knew God was just getting started God had given us a vision to start more People's Church locations to see even more changed lives once again again we prayed and many people gave sacrificially to start People's Church locations they would never attend our vision field Church stepped out in faith and invested millions of dollars to start the Midwest City Campus and the Northwest Campus these two campuses have reached thousands of people with the hope of Christ every time we've added seats God has added Souls but we knew God had even more people for us to reach and this time it was a massive Faith step but we prayed trusted God and gave sacrificially to start a People's Church campus that most people would never see in Oklahoma City 750 Mi away in Indianapolis and once again God bless this massive faith and that campus has around a thousand people attending on Sundays and so many lives are being transformed here is the heartbeat of people's Church we've seen it time and time again every time we've added seats God has added Souls I thank God you have always had a heart and vision to sacrifice for those who are not here yet that's who we are at People's Church many of you your kids teenagers grandkids friends every week sit in a People's Church Auditorium or kids environment because someone sacrificed and gave years ago for those who were not here yet right now we are in a truly historic season as a church after 20 plus years of existence many churches go into a slow decline but at people's Church we're having our best years Ever every Sunday we're seeing thousands of people from different ages races backgrounds worshiping together as our world becomes more and more divided God has raised up People's Church to be a house of diversity and unity the diversity and unity at People's Church is very very rare it's special what we have it's the hand of God more cities states need what we have our divided world needs to see a unified Church it needs more and more people's churches and we have to keep expanding and keep our focus on those who are not here yet our communities need what we have we are having record setting Sunday attendance and we're seeing thousands of people coming to faith in Christ every single year in 2023 we baptized 994 people in water it's a amazing what God is doing in 2024 we're on paage to see over 1,000 people water baptized that's unbelievable the majority of churches in the United States do not have the Evangelistic anointing and momentum that God has given us God has raised up People's Church to be a soul winning Church a church on the front lines snatching people out of the grips of hell we are a unique Church where it's okay not to be okay you can come just like you are with Hurts Habits and Hangups and when people far from God start attending one of our locations they experience the power of the holy spirit because we are a Spirit-filled church we have a culture of reaching people far from God but also we have an environment where the holy spirit is moving and transforming Hearts people are being healed experiencing Miracles being filled with the Holy Spirit and discovering their god-given purpose what God is doing at our church is rare and special to God be all the glory and we're also a church that's reaching the Next Generation nobody is more committed to reaching kids and teenagers and discipling them to be world class Godly leaders than people's church we are a nextg church with a hundreds and hundreds of kids teenagers and young adults being equipped at our church every week through our kids Youth and Young Adult Ministry and through our People's Church Leadership College and this is just the beginning we are just getting started God has so much more for us here at our Indianapolis campus we have been leasing 30,000 square ft of this building that's actually 58,000 total square fet in 2024 we got an incredible offer from the owner to purchase the entire facility along with the five acres it sits on for 3.2 million that's $55 per square foot which is well under market value we closed on the building on June 28th and now we have a cheaper payment than what we were paying to lease the building come on Andy thank you Lord for your favor but we bought our first permited home because God has called us to reach more people we can now expand this building with a brand new spacious Lobby approximately a 900 seat state of the art Auditorium more Prime parking spaces and expand the PC kids area to reach and disciple more kids for Jesus this project will cost approximately imely $3 million right now we have four Sunday services and we're seeing around a, people worshiping at our Indie campus on Sundays with the renovations of our first permited home we can more than double our attendance and our impact this more spiritual journey campaign is not about a building it's about all the lives that will be changed through this building this Journey this building this step of faith is all about people it's about Heath this is About Dre it's about Shannon this is about Tasha this is about Juliet and Jay and the countless more who have found Hope Freedom healing and purpose and have been radically Changed by the power of Christ church family here is what I know from years of Walking with God in order to see more in our church it has to start with God doing more in each of us it has to begin with you and with me God always does more in and through his people that's why we're going on a spiritual journey called more the scripture that's on my heart on Pastor Chris's heart for our church is Ephesians chapter three and verse 20 now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us I believe God wants to do more through you through me that's why I'm asking everyone who calls People's Church home to participate in this spiritual journey I call this a spiritual journey because it's truly going to deepen our faith our trust in God and our dependence on God as we all go on this journey God is going to speak to each of us about our part to help make the vision become reality you are a vital part of our church Church we're in everyone Church everyone does their part to see the vision become a reality no matter how long you've been attending our Indianapolis campus you are a vital part of our church People's Church isn't everyone Church everyone does their part to see the vision become a reality today I'm asking you pastors Chris and Jamie are asking you to decide to be a part of this spiritual journey so that together we can reach people who are not here yet that's who we are that's who we will always be it has always

everyone committed to making a three-year commitment on October 6th you will see a commitment card in the guide that you're going to get and I want you to begin to pray over that card and ask God what he wants you to do our goal is for everyone who calls People's Church your church home to make a threeyear financial commitment over and above your tithe in normal giving to renovating our first permanent home if you're a guest please you feel no obligation to make a commitment we're just so glad that you are here worshiping with us and you may be asking why is People's Church doing a spiritual journey and renovating its first permanent home here's why we're doing it for you we're doing it for your friends and family who need to know Jesus Jesus we're doing it for the people who are not here yet we're doing it to see more changed lives and then number four we want everyone committed to giving in the miracle offering October 13th through December 31st we want everyone to give their largest Miracle offering towards their three-year commitment people have asked how quickly can we renovate our first permanent home the speed of the project will move at the speed of our giving we are ready to get started right away and we're believing God for a miracle offering of $300,000 to a million dollars so that we can begin this project we have a lender lined up but we want all of us to give generously so that we can pay cash for as much of this building as possible the less debt we have to service the more Ministry we can do locally nationally and around the world and Jamie and I we are 100% committed we've always led by example we are making the largest commitment we have ever made and we are going to be giving the largest Miracle offering that we have ever given and what I want you to deeply understand is that our three-year Financial commitments and our Miracle offering really isn't about a building it's about more changed lives it's about people who need to find the hope of Christ we're adding more seats so that God can add more souls it's about people and I want you to see this incredible powerful story so that you can be reminded of why we do what we do check out this video always I felt that something was missing at a young age I started smoking um I would drink with friends you know because that's what everyone was doing I was just trying to find relationships I would say that would validate me that's what I was always in search for with that came a lot of hurt a lot of Shame a lot of [Music] guilt I would say it felt like like a god-sized hole was in me and I really truly feel like my parents didn't know how to love properly my dad was on bad drugs even heroin my mom so she had like a wall built up so growing up I think that I was loved from a dysfunction I would say the lowest moment in my life I was raped and I blamed myself a lot of my confidence was stripped and it was was just like lies from the enemy that I I was the reason for this and and I just think that with all of that hurt at such a young age I just did I didn't know how to be loved I didn't know how to properly [Music] love so one of my best friends she invited me to People's Church and I was like okay yeah I'll go you know I did not know that it was going to change my life so then after going to People's Church I was baptized February 19th after that almost the next day almost immediately I had this fire in my soul to know him to know more of him to serve him so then I got plugged into growth track I discovered my gifts my um confidence was very stripped from me so it was like oh here are these spiritual gifts that you've been given and we will use them and it was just all of these things that I I never felt before now with serving I first got plugged in with kindergarten through first grade I never thought that I could serve in a church I never thought that that was a possibility serving for him it is changed my heart it's changed my life it's given me a heart posture of servitude and I think that it's even carried outside of church for those who don't have a home life a family life you have that with people's church and when I started walking with Jesus I was like just so overwhelmed by the amount of love that I felt like I just never have experienced that I never felt love like this amen this is why we do what we do there are thousands and thousands of people at our church that have a story like Shannon it's always been about more changed lives next Sunday September 15th we'll have our normal service times but we want to have a special prayer service from 5: to 6 p.m. in our space that we are going to be renovating and I want to invite all of you to come we're going to go in that space we're going to pray over it and then we're going to we're going to have pencils and we're going to write names of all the Shannon in our life we're going to write names of our friends and family and our co-workers and everybody we know that needs Jesus and so would you mark your calendars would you put it on your calendar next Sunday 5 let's come back 5: to 6 let's pack that room out and we're going to pray and we're going to seek the face of God and we're going to believe God for more changed lives we're going to cover this season in prayer because this is a spiritual journey that God has each of us on it's

and as we go on this journey God is going to do the more that his word promises he's going to do far more abund abundantly than we could ever ask or think according to his power that's at work within us"
9MgpKlPrU5U,but today we are continuing our series called reintroducing the Holy Spirit and I'm excited every week we're just going to learn more and more and more about the Holy Spirit our theme verse for this series is Acts 19 2. Paul ran in to some disciples and he said did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed he asked them no they replied we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit we learned last week that Paul asked these believers did you receive the Holy Spirit see Paul knew that they had salvation but they also needed the power of the Holy Spirit and he knew it was a necessity for Effective Christian Living and these disciples didn't even know about it and some of you you're like the disciples in Ephesus you don't know anything about the Holy Spirit or maybe you only know a little about the Holy Spirit others you know a lot about the Holy Spirit you know Jamie and I we've been married 19 years and I will never stop learning James even though I've learned a lot in 19 years I got to keep learning her because the day I stopped learning her our relationship will become dry and stale we'll start drifting apart and it's the same way with the Holy Spirit we have to keep learning and getting closer to the Holy Spirit when Paul found out that these disciples didn't know about the Holy Spirit he couldn't wait for them to learn about the Holy Spirit and for them to encounter the spirit of God Paul knew that the Holy Spirit was a game changer the holy spirit is a spiritual life hack have you ever had someone show you a life hack you might be like Pastor I don't know what a life hack is here's a life hack you've been using something and then you found out you weren't using it properly and when you figured out the right way to use it a light bulb went off in your head you're like oh my I can't believe I didn't know it becomes a game changer for you here are some life hacks from the internet I discovered this life hack three years ago I was picking up my nephew Nick from the airport and I was driving Jamie's car and I had to get gas and you know whenever you drive someone else's car you ever yell like me your brain you can't right remember which side the you know the gas cap is on and I'm like man I'm like hey did I pull into the right spot and he's like well don't you know like on your fuel gauge there's an arrow it lets you know I've been driving for 20 years trying to remember oh that Arrow tells you where your gas cap is some of y'all your mind blown right now I don't ever have to worry about it anymore I didn't even I had to go in my other car I didn't sure if I believe them it was there oh oh my goodness life hack here's another life hack you ever purchase new clothes and you get the little swab of cloth in the button and some of you like oh I know that's warm if you lose a button you got an extra button and if you tear uh you know something in your clothes you got a little bit of fabric to patch it up but that's actually not what that piece of fabric is for that piece of fabric was created the purpose of it was so that you could test out different cleaning products so that you won't ruin your clothes some of y'all been risky you're like I hope this doesn't mess it up oh and then you oh man you're like oh my goodness here's another one come on how many y'all ever found yourself wrestling this bottle of ketchup come on come on tell the truth how many y'all just shaking the fire out of that thing why won't it come out you stopped buying Hines because it was too difficult but the number 57 on the Heinz bottle is what the company's spokesman calls a soft spot all you need to do is apply a firm tap where the bottle Narrows and the ketchup just slides on out come on everybody like me I was like the Macho Man Randy Savage throwing High elbows on that ketchup bottle like what is wrong with you here's another one I mean I got an oven you got a drawer at the bottom of your oven and you gotta you got a drawer at the bottom come on how many of you like you got pans in there utensils all the stuff you don't know where to put you're like oh praise the Lord I got this nice I got another little drawer to put stuff in it wasn't actually designed for that the manufacturers originally made that drawer for keeping food warm until you were ready to serve it come on how many people actually do that okay a couple of you yeah y'all are awesome we weren't we don't ever have to worry about the food getting cold now here's the last one Chick-fil-A you go through the drive-through whereas Cohen says Chick-fil-A nobody wants to wait till they get home to start eating those nuggets you know what I mean you got your drinks you got your drink you drink up holder but you got you got lap you know what I mean trying to be a trying to eat and drink at the same time will end the Nuggets containers actually a little flap that flap is to put your straw through so that you can start oh you can eat your nuggets and drink your drink without getting in a wreck without any problem bam you're like I need a nugget you just grab the cup buy the Nugget out of that box swallow that nugget I need a drink just drinking a drink yeah oh yeah y'all going to Chick-fil-A after church no you're not not open on Sundays but tomorrow oh you can't wait mind blown life hacks are learning how the Creator designed a product to make things easier and better for you life hacks are just encountering the product the way it was intended to be encountered and many people are not encountering all the benefits of the holy spirit because they don't know the Holy Spirit life hacks and so today I'm going to share with you 23 Holy Spirit life hacks you say three no I said 23 Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready if you're taking notes on your phone get your thumbs ready and if you got your pen and paper get ready 23 Holy Spirit life hacks functions of the holy spirit that will make your life easier and better number one is this the Holy Spirit reveals Jesus to you a primary role of the holy spirit in our life in our world today is to reveal and point people to Jesus Look what Jesus says in John 16 13-14 it says but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is Yet to Come it says he will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you listen if you want to get to know Jesus better you need to get to know the Holy Spirit better because the Holy Spirit glorifies Jesus he puts the attention the spotlight the focus on Jesus John 15 26 it says when The Advocate comes whom I will send you from the father Jesus said the spirit of Truth who goes out from the father he will testify about me the Holy Spirit testifies about Jesus here's the spiritual life hack get to know the Holy Spirit and you'll get to know Jesus number two the holy spirit is your seal every Christ follower is sealed with the Holy Spirit non-christians are not sealed with the Holy Spirit Romans 8 9 you however are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the spirit if indeed the spirit of God lives in you and if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ they do not belong to Christ if you don't have the Holy Spirit living inside of you you are not a Christ follower Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 through 14 it says and you were also included in Christ when you heard the message of Truth The Gospel of your salvation when you believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised Holy Spirit who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the Redemption of those who are God's possession to the praise of his glory when you believe that Jesus was your lord and savior you were born again and immediately sealed with the Holy Spirit the sealing of the Holy Spirit it guarantees you of your inheritance of Heaven here's the spiritual life hack the sealing of the holy spirit opens your eyes to the things of the spirit First Corinthians 2 14. but people who aren't spiritual can't receive the truth from God's spirit it all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it for only those who are spiritual can understand what the spirit means at Salvation being sealed with the Holy Spirit it opens our eyes to the things of the spirit number three the Holy Spirit convicts you John 16 8 Jesus says and when he comes he will convict the world of its sin and of God's righteousness and of the coming judgment the Holy Spirit convicts the world for salvation and Christians for sanctification without the conviction of the Holy Spirit we will do what our sinful nature desires and so here's the spiritual life hack the holy spirit's conviction is such a good thing I thank God for the conviction of the Holy Spirit it has saved me it has Set Me Free I thank God for it we get saved because of his conviction and then we become more like Jesus because of conviction number four the holy spirit makes you holy the Holy Spirit convicts us and produces Holiness inside of us when we let the spirit work in our life the result is we become more and more holy we become more and more like Jesus Romans 15 16. I am a special messenger from Christ Jesus to the Gentiles I bring you the good news so that I might present you as an acceptable offering to God made Holy by the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit produces Holiness in you when you let the spirit work in your life the result is he makes you more and more holy more and more like Jesus here's the spiritual life hack the more you get to know the Holy Spirit the more he will make you holy and the more he will make you want to be holy A.W Tozer said religion can reform a person's life but it can never transform him only the Holy Spirit can transform you can't live a holy life without the help of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit sanctifies us he sets you apart and he makes you more like Jesus number five the Holy Spirit produces fruit in you here's the life hack get more of the Holy Spirit and you'll get more of his fruit let's look what the fruit of the spirit is or excuse me Galatians chapter 5 verse 22-23 but the Holy Spirit produces this kind of

jump roping with it nowadays everything is wireless a lot of things have changed the last 20 years but let me tell you what hasn't changed at people's church we have not changed what we believe our vision or the mission that god has called us to accomplish together and as long as we're the pastors it will not change the vision the mission and our beliefs and so i want to look today at a portion of scripture that's very foundational to who we are at people's church for the last 20 years and it still is today i've personally taught this passage many times and and i will continue to because it's the heartbeat of the early church and it's the heartbeat of people's church look with me in acts chapter 2 verse 42-47 it's as they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer everyone was filled with all at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles all the believers were together and had everything in common they sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising god and enjoying the favor of all the people and the lord added to their number daily those who are being saved the key word i want to focus on today is devoted it say they they devoted themselves that word devoted means they dedicated they committed they continued steadfastly they focused see what you are devoted to defines you what you are devoted to defines you and i want to give you the three p's that we are devoted to here at people's church the three p's we are devoted to number one is this we are a place of principle acts 2 42 it says they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching the early church was devoted to the principles and the teachings in the word of god they had a deep devotion to god's word look at acts 8 4 it says those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went acts 15 35 it says but paul and barnabas remained in antioch where they and many others taught and preached the word of the lord acts 14 25 it says and when they had preached the word in perga they went down to italia the early church was devoted to the word of god and people's church we are devoted to god's word we are devoted to the principles and teachings in the word of god see no matter how much society changes its opinions about different issues in our day we are devoted to the word of god no matter how much culture changes we are devoted and we are holding on to the word of god we are a bible believing church we're devoted to his word and in john chapter 8 verse 31 it says to the jews who had believed him jesus said if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples we are true disciples if we hold onto the word of god and we believed the bible was god's word 20 years ago and we still believe it today we believe the bible is the inspired word of god we believe what the bible teaches we believe that there's one true god who exists in three persons god the father god the son god the holy spirit we believe in the deity of our lord jesus christ that he was born of a virgin mary he was a hundred percent man and a hundred percent god he lived a sinless life and he died on the cross of calvary and was raised on the third day we believe god created human beings as man and woman we believe in the sanctity of marriage we believe all mankind is born into sin and needs a savior and the only hope for redemption is through the shed blood of jesus christ we believe that every believer should be baptized in water we believe in taking holy communion and remembering the price that jesus paid for our sins we believe in being baptized in the holy spirit for the power to be a witness we believe in the gifts of the holy spirit that they're still available today so we can minister to hurting humanity we believe in healing word of knowledge word of wisdom prophecy tongues and interpretations we believe god still performs signs wonders and miracles we believe god is called every christ follower to be sanctified by living a holy life set apart from god and we believe jesus is coming a second time and every person will spend eternity in either heaven or hell because we believe god's word we hold on to god's word and we have two convictions about god's word number one is this we live by god's word we live by god's word james 1 22 it says do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says we are not a church that just listens to the word we strive to live by it we strive to do what it says luke 11 verse 28 it says he replied blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it we live the word of god matthew 7 24 it says therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts him into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock we want our lives and our church to be built on the rocks so we live the word of god we don't spend our time trying to deconstruct or change the word of god no no no we spend our time changing and aligning aligning our life up with god's word god's word says it and we strive to live it and so we live by god's word number two we preach god's word second timothy chapter four verse two it says preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct and rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction at people's church we preach the word of god we aren't preaching popular opinion political opinion or cultural opinion we preach god's word we live in a time right now where there are some preachers pastors churches are drifting away from the word of god they're no longer devoted to preaching god's word the bible tells us this will happen in the very next verse look at first timothy chapter 4 verse 3 and 4. it's first says for the time will come and i'm telling you today that time has come when people will not put up with sound doctrine instead to suit their own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching itching ears want to hear they will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths there are preachers in churches who are turning away from the truth they're twisting the truth and they're no longer preaching sound doctrine listen church be on guard against false teachings and false teachers you want to listen to the preaching of god's word you want to be at a church and listen to preachers that divide god's word correctly and rightly and as your pastor listen i don't want you to be deceived you got to watch out look what romans 16 17 says it says and now i make one more appeal my dear brothers and sisters watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught stay away from them listen don't start running around with people who cause division who don't have sound doctrine second peter chapter two verse one and two it says but there were also false prophets in israel just as there will be false teachers among you they will cleverly teach destructive heresies and even deny the master who bought them in this way they will bring sudden destruction on themselves many will follow their evil teaching and shameful immorality and because of these teachers the way of the truth will be slandered church i don't want you following evil immoral or slanderous teachings and so at people's church we are committed to preaching and teaching god's word we preach the bible because the bible has and will continue to pass the test of time because it's god's word it is the word of god from god first peter 1 25 it says but the word of the lord endures forever and this is the word that was preached to you we are going to preach the bible to you here at people's church we are holding on to god's word we are a place of principle will we live by god's word we'll preach by god's word number two here let me give you the second p is we are a place of prayer we are a place of prayer acts chapter 2 verse 42. it says they devoted themselves to the apostle teachings into fellowship into the breaking of bread and to prayer the early church was devoted to prayer you see it time and time again in the early church that they were they were a praying church and god moved powerfully through their prayers acts chapter 6 verse 4 it says but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word romans 12 12 it says rejoicing in hope persevering in tribulation devoted to prayer colossians 4 2 it says devote yourselves to prayer being watchful and thankful the early church was devoted to prayer and here at people's church we are devoted to prayer that's why every january we have our three weeks of prayer and fasting that's why every august now we just started this a couple years ago we have our 21 days of prayer listen i'm at those 6 a.m prayer meetings every morning because i need them i need more prayer i need more of god every 21 days of prayer i'm telling him and god is working and speaking he's

morning in our luck at night every morning when i get into my car i need my key to get my car started prayer should be the key prayer should get our prayer should get our day started every morning every day it should be the key to our morning and then it needs to be our luck at night i don't know about y'all but i'm thankful for this little device that allows me to lock my car doors without being right next to my car matter of fact a few years ago it was late at night i was in bed and i think i was starting to fall asleep and i heard some noise out in front of my house i'm like what a and then i heard some more noise and i'm like is somebody in my driveway is somebody messing with my car now y'all are braver than me you'd run and run outside and not me i think of crazy stuff i'm like they may have a gun they may shoot me but i had my keyless i was like i just started i'm like if somebody's at my car right now oh they're getting locked in locked out i just started hitting that button with the quickness and all of a sudden i heard some folks running off like yeah that's right hey but listen you better believe the enemy is waiting for you to sleep to doze off he's hoping you don't got your life on lockdown with prayer he's hoping to slip in come on prayer needs to be the key to start our day and it needs to be the lock to end our night come on we need god's luck we need his protection over our life to protect us from the enemy his schemes his lies prayer needs to be the key to our mourning in the lock at our night we are a place of principle we are a place of prayer and then number three we are a place of power acts chapter 2 verse 43 it says everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles see the early church was devoted to seeing the power of god change lives they know they needed god's power to see lives changed look at first corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 it says for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power everybody say power come on how do you know art this generation needs to experience the power of god they're up against so much the devil is throwing his best punch at our generation and listen we need to know this and god's power can overcome the devil and his schemes and the attack the power of god nothing can withstand the power of god we need the power of god in our lives romans chapter

listen there is no one nothing that can talk me out of serving god i've experienced his power i this power has set me free his power has cleaned up my mind his power has saved my marriage his power has has meant i've had moments in the altar just sensing the power of god there's nothing anyone can say or do that can convince me to stop serving a mighty and powerful and loving god i've had the power of god prophesied over my life let me tell you i want you to experience his power romans 1 16 it says for i am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of god that brings salvation to everyone who believes first to the jew then to the gentile salvation happens by the power of god first thessalonians chapter 1 verse 5 it says because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the holy spirit and deep conviction we need the preaching of the gospel and we also need the power of god we need both and we have to have both first corinthians chapter two verse four this is my message and my preaching we're not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirit's power i'm going to say it again we need the preaching of the word of god and we need a demonstration of the spirit's power and here at people's church we believe in the demonstration of the holy spirit's power we believe the god who perform miracles in the bible still performs them today we believe in all powerful god still heals sick bodies open blinds eyes and unstops dead ears that god is the same yesterday today and forever and he still does miracle come on is there anybody that's ever received a miracle or healing god still does miracles we believe god's power still performs the greatest miracle of all saving lost souls we want to see god perform miracle signs and wonders we want to see god heal sick bodies heal minds heal relationships but none of those miracles come close to comparing to the greatest miracle of all when god saves a lost soul come on god

believe the prayers we prayed during that 21 days God is going to continue to answer in 2023 and Beyond well the title of my message today is I wish I would have known people were here for me I wish I would have known people were here for me Jackie Robinson was the first black person to play Major League Baseball he broke baseball's color barrier and he faced jeering crowds in every Stadium while playing one day in his home stadium in Brooklyn he committed an error the fans began to ridicule him screaming at him jeering him and he he stood at second base and he stood there humiliated while the fans jeered and then shortstop Peewee Reese came over stood next to him put his arm around Jackie Robinson and faced the crowd the fans grew quiet Robinson later said that arm around his shoulder saved his career it's powerful to think that this act of Brotherhood saved the career of Jackie Robinson and I'm sure that Pee Wee Reese had no idea that this simple hug this simple show of I'm here with you my brother would have that big of an impact you know there's something powerful that happens inside all of us when we know people are with us I'll never forget when Jamie and I went through a really dark and challenging season in our marriage things got really bad and I'm thankful for Shelby Johnson a man of God a good friend that met with us and counseled us and cared for us and listened and processed and he said man I'm I'm with you guys I'm here I'm beside you anything that you need and Shelby played a big part in Jamie and I getting back on track he played a big heart and healing begin beginning to come into our lives and into our marriage listen everybody needs a Peewee Reese and a Shelby in their lives and I want to teach today about two men named Paul and Silas they were thrown into prison together for preaching about Jesus so let's pick up the story in Acts chapter 16 verse 25 through 26. it says about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the other prisoners were listening to them suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundation of the prison were shaken at once all the prison doors flew open and everyone's chains came loose come on Paul and Silas were praising God at midnight in prison singing Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus come on they were in Chains singing Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain and in the midst of praising God their prison chains fell off and the prison doors flew open and they were free but what's even more powerful is that all the other prisoners chains fell off as well their praise didn't just set them free it set all the prisoners free you need to know your praise is powerful your worship is a weapon come on you can be set free by praising God praise God at church go home and and in your house and give praise and worship the Lord then chains will come falling off your kids chains will come falling off your spouse there's chain breaking power in the power of praise and this was a great day for everyone in the prison except for one man the jailer who was in charge of all the prisoners their freedom was horrible news for him listen to the next verse Acts 16 27 it says the Jailer woke up and when he saw the prison doors open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped the prisoners were free and the Jailer knew he was going to be in trouble the government was going to think that he released all these prisoners and he would lose his job maybe his life matter of fact some theologians say the rule for jailers in that day is that if their prisoners escaped they were to suffer the punishment that that prisoner was going to receive matter of fact it was an Unwritten custom for a Jailer who had prisoners escape to take their own life to save themselves from the embarrassment and torture it was a bad day for this jailer I want to talk to you about bad days number one bad days are a part of life everybody else in the prison was free and having a great day but the Jailer was having a very bad day have you ever been there before people all around you having a great day and smiling and it's your worst day ever everyone else is getting good news you getting bad news everyone else is talking about their blessings and you're experiencing pain and heartache I mean you just fasted 21 days got up early came to prayer and it just feels like nothing is happening in your life as a matter of fact things actually got worse and then homeboy at work he ain't been praying and fasting he'd been eating steak and desserts every night and just talking about how great his day is and everything's going good and you're like Lord what is happening and the truth of the matter is we all have bad days it doesn't matter if you're a Christian or a non-Christian it doesn't matter how much you come to church how much you pray how much you read the Bible you will have a bad day in 2020 when the world shut down I think we all maybe had some bad days in that season I know I did I know that I got depressed I got depressed I was getting frustrated with God questioning why what is going on I remember being irritated my anxiety started to flare up I was having panic attacks at night because there's this new virus going around and I was I was not I was I was miserable during that time I remember talking with other pastors they're like I love online church I record the sermon on Thursday I'm sitting in my pajamas on Sunday I remember thinking I want to punch you in the face I hate online Church no I was struggling y'all I had some bad days everyone has bad days and bad Seasons but it's how you handle them that matters most my second point is don't harm yourself on bad days let's look back at the story The jailer's having a bad day pull out his knife he's about to kill himself acts 16 28 but Paul shouted don't harm yourself he yelled don't harm yourself don't kill yourself see on bad days the percentages majorly increase that someone will do something to harm themselves listen on bad days you'll be tempted to make a permanent decision due to a temporary situation and today your pastor I'm your Apostle Paul I want to say don't harm yourself over a bad day or a bad season as you go through 2023 you will encounter some bad days but don't harm yourself don't make a permanent decision over a temporary situation or feelings come on don't make the stupid decision don't turn to drugs don't start drinking again don't have the affair don't abandon your family don't drop out of college don't start sleeping around don't cheat on the business deal don't start taking pills don't start binge eating don't start looking at porn don't run away from home don't start charging up credit cards don't go back to the old friendships don't stop attending church don't stop reading the Bible and praying and don't don't take your own life don't commit suicide in December I was on Twitter and I saw just a ton of people posting about a gentleman nickname twitch I clicked on it and I learned he was a popular television and social media dancer and personality who took his life he had a wife and three kids his career was booming I wish someone could have said to him no matter what you're facing no matter the mistakes you've made don't make a permanent decision due to a temporary situation or feeling church family don't harm yourself your family your future on bad days and if there's someone here today or maybe watching online and you're having suicidal thoughts please call or text the National Suicide Prevention number it's very easy it's 988 you can dial 988 or you can text 988 don't harm yourself on bad days on your bad days I want you to know this third point we are all here acts 16 28 Paul shouted don't harm yourself we are all here he shouted don't harm yourself we're all here he didn't say don't harm yourself man you got a good job don't harm yourself you're gonna buy a new home this year don't harm yourself you're going to get out of debt don't harm yourself your health is going to get better no no he said don't harm yourself we are all here Paul said me and the prisoners we haven't left you we are all here and this story is such a great picture of what God's plan is for his church no matter what people are facing in life the church is supposed to rise up and say don't harm yourself we are all here God is here for you the church is here for you we are here for you we are all here we are all here come on look at your neighbor and say we are here for you tell hey get your other neighbor you can't leave them out tell them we are here for you we're here for you number one we are here for you during bad times Paul and Silas were there for this Jailer on what had to be one of his worst moments in life he was emotionally distraught and ready to die but things changed because Paul and Silas were there for him in his time of need as a church we are here for you during bad times difficult times lonely times painful times heartbreaking times and grieving times Romans 12 15 it says Rejoice with those who Rejoice mourn with those who mourn God has called us as the Church of Jesus Christ to mourn with those who mourn and to be there for people on their worst day we all need people who are full of the love of God to cry with us grieve with us to listen to us to comfort us to walk with us during difficult seasons that's why I am so thankful for small groups I got saved at 18 years old and when I got saved at the church I was attending I got in a small group when I went to college I was in small groups after college I've done Ministry at three different churches in three different states and in every single one of those churches I've been in a small group and I can tell you in every single one of those scenarios and those places I had some bad days I had some rough seasons and I thank God for my small group that was there to cry with me to pray with me to grieve with me to comfort me I wouldn't have made it without my small group First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 26 and 27. it says if one part suffers every part suffers with it we are called by God to suffer with one another we're each a part of the body of Christ and we have small groups at People's Church so that we can be there for one another when we take the time to build relationships with one another then we're able to be there for each other see the early church was there for each other because they built relationships with one another look at Acts 2 verse 44-47. it says all the Believers were together and had everything in common they sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere Hearts they were able to meet each other's needs because they had a relationship with one another they were in each other's homes they were friends they knew each other and for us to be the church that God has called us to be we can't just come to a service on Sunday you can't care for others and others can't care for you if you only come to church on Sundays Sunday services are important but so are small groups you need to have friendships in our church you don't need to know everybody but you need to be friends with somebody listen individually we're just a drop of water bloop that's it but together we're an ocean come on you have been in the ocean in the waves I mean the the power the strength it's full is together come on together we are an ocean We Are Better Together We are stronger together we are more powerful together secondly we are here for you during Good Times Paul and Silas were there for the Jailer when things went from bad to good look at acts 16 34 it says the Jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them it said he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God he and his whole household he was filled with joy because Paul and Silas led him to faith in Christ they were there with him celebrating and rejoicing I love the church because we're here for each other not just during the bad times but also during Good Times Romans 12 15 Rejoice with those who Rejoice First Corinthians 12 26 if one part suffers every part suffers with it if one part is honored every part rejoices with it we all need to have people who love Jesus in our lives that can celebrate our victories and successes come on people who celebrate when you get engaged or married people who rejoice when you have a child or grandchild people who shout when you get the promotion people who celebrate when you buy the new home someone had to give you a fist bump and praise God when you make an A in that class people to thank the Lord with you in one of your big prayer requests get answered you have plenty of haters you need some celebrators come on you need some celebrators you need some people who will rejoice and praise God with you that's the church that's what small groups is all about thirdly we are here for you to experience Community acts 16 34. it says the Jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before him before them this is when the church is at its best Paul and Silas went to the jailer's home they met his family they ate together they Fellowship they built Community we all need Christ followers who know about our life who know our family who know our spouse who know our kids Christ followers to enjoy life with to eat with to shop with to golf with to fish with to drink coffee with to laugh with to people watch and laugh with come on where my people Watchers at I'm a I'm a total people watcher we need each other and we are here for you listen it's not not isolation but participation and then fourthly we are here for your faith to grow acts 16 verse 32 and 33 it says then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house at that hour of the night the Jailer took them and washed their wounds then immediately he and his whole household were baptized after the Jailer and his household gave their life to Christ Paul and Silas helped them to take their next step spiritually and they all got water baptized a big step after you give your life to Jesus is to be water baptized and we cannot wait to celebrate with you at People's Church February 19th when we have our next water baptism man be sure to get sign of you given your life to Christ and you have not been water baptized man take that next step in 2023 you can sign up you can easily just text in text see baptism to 9400 to sign up to get water baptized maybe you were younger and you got baptized for all the wrong reasons come on get baptized on February 19th maybe you were like me I was baptized as a baby but that was my parents decision that wasn't my decision and so I thank God that that they they made that decision but water baptism is a personal decision so if you haven't personally made that decision man February 19th sign up get water baptized and we can't wait to celebrate with you taking that important spiritual step in your walk with God Paul and Silas said we are here for you we are here for you in bad times good times for community and for your faith to grow our faith grows best together your faith doesn't grow

6qB8iyYf7KA,uh well today we are continuing our series called own it and the title of my message today is own your addictions own your addictions I've had some addictions throughout my life when I was a child M uh Elementary age elementary maybe Middle School I was addicted to little Debbies oh yeah oatmeal cream pie Star Crunch fudge rounds Zebra Cakes my mom would buy some little Debbies I'd grab one to eat and then I'd take like seven of them bad boys and hide them in my room my mom my siblings like where all the little debb is at Christopher I what man I wasn't telling nobody I was so addicted and I would eat them all up matter of fact I had like my under my bed it was like an Amazon of Little Debbie rappers my mom had to start hiding the little Debbies I wasn't faced when everybody went to sleep I busted out my ninja SK skills y'all I'm searching the pots and the pans under the sink I'm climbing on top of cabinets I could remember Army crawling in my mom's bedroom I'm looking underneath her bed for the live I was going to find those little Debbies y'all and I did and she'd have to hide him again then I'd find them again and then y'all got so good at searching I found my mom's secret chocolate stash come on how you ladies got a secret chocolate stash oh look you know some of you don't want to confess you don't I ain't I ain't raising my hand I I ain't have nobody looking for my secret chocolate stash so now I'm not only getting little Debbies I'm getting into her dark chocolate secret chocolate stash every night scouring the house y'all I had issues I had issues you know in high school started to form some addictions started having sexual addiction got addicted to alcohol in high school is when I started drinking and um matter of fact it became a vice for me if I if I wanted to have a good time I got drunk if I had a bad day I got drunk I had alcohol hidden in my closet and so for a couple of my years in high school uh got addicted was drinking was getting drunk almost every uh single weekend uh there was a time in my life where I was a workaholic I was addicted to work matter of fact one of our executive pastors had to call me into his office he had to sit me down saying Chris what you're doing is not good this is not this is not healthy I can remember a time where the Holy Spirit convicted me I was addicted to sports media and news and I got all the notifications and I had all the apps and I was watching it nonstop and I was just I was I was consuming all this I just wanted more and more and more and I I remember the holy spirit so specifically thinking to me Chris did I call you to has ESPN been calling you recently have they they've been asking for your analysis like no imagine if you would spend that much time on your marriage being being a better husband being a better father spending that time with me and we all can get addicted our flesh it can happen so easy it can happen to the best of us and it can happen in so many different ways shapes and forms some more harmful than others but nonetheless today I I want to talk about how to own your addictions because to break free from an addiction you have to own it and today we're going to look at a man who found himself addicted and experiencing death in so many areas of his life we find his story in Luke chapter 8 verse 27 look at verse 27 it says as Jesus was climbing out of a boat a man who was possessed by demons came out to meet him for a long time he had been homeless and naked living in a cemetery outside of the Town verse 29 describes this man a little bit more says for Jesus already commanded the evil spirit to come out of him the spirit had often taken control of the man even when he was placed under guard and put in Chains and shackles he simply broke them and rushed out into the Wilderness completely under the Demon's power when you read Mark's version of the story he mentioned how this man was cutting himself with with sharp Stones this man was addicted bound possessed Chained and hurting in the worst way and cutting himself there are many people in our world who are cutting themselves with drug and alcohol addiction workaholic addiction pornography addiction sexual addiction gambling addiction shopping addictions food and eating addictions technology and social media addiction and some of you today even find yourself completely under the control of an addiction and so today we're going to learn how to own it and break free from addictions I want to share six steps to own Breaking Free from addictions and listen when I say steps I'm not trying to say it's an easy formula okay addictions are tough to break free from but God's word has answers and so we're going to look at them today and so here's the first step the first step on going to Jesus Luke 8:27 and 28 it says as Jesus was climbing out of the boat a man who was B possessed by demons came to meet him for a long time he had been homeless and naked living in the cemetery outside of the town and as soon as he saw Jesus he shrieked and he fell down in front of him when this bound man saw Jesus he went to him and fell to his knees the very first step to Breaking Free is we must own going to Jesus because Jesus has the power to set you free Jesus actually came to Earth to set us free Luke 4:18 Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor he has sent me to Proclaim that the captives will be released that the blind will see and that the oppressed will be set free Jesus came to Earth to set free those that were captive bound addicted and oppressed Jesus came to break every chain in our lives and this naked man was living in a cemetery for a long time and he was severely bound but he went to Jesus and Jesus set him free please understand no matter how long you've been bound addicted your situation is not hopeless Jesus can set you free and a lot of people don't give Jesus a chance because they think their situation is hopeless but Matthew 19:26 says Jesus looked at them and said with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible with man it may be impossible to break free from an addiction but With God all things are possible but Pastor I've been this way for years so was the demon-possessed man but With God all things are possible statistics say I can't break free but With God all things are possible but I've tried to quit over and over and over again With God all things are possible this addiction has been in my family for Generations I don't see a Way Out With God all things are possible you got to own it and run to Jesus take your addiction to Jesus all things are possible with Jesus number two the second step on being honest about your addiction Luke 8:30 Jesus asked him what is your name legion he replied because many demons had gone into him this man confessed that he was bound and held captive not by one demon but by many demons and a major step to own Breaking Free from an addiction is admitting that you have one admitting that you need help and this is so hard for many to do we don't like to admit that we have issues we don't like to admit that we have an addiction matter of fact when people point it out I mean you're addicted we get defensive you don't know what you're talking about we like to hide addictions sometimes we're even in denial we fool ourselves thinking we're okay I'm good I'm not list I don't got a problem I'm good I'm okay don't worry about me okay I'm or or or we fake it like we're okay we like to cover up our addictions Proverbs 28 verse 13 says people who conceal their sins sins will not Prosper but if they confess and turn from them they will receive Mercy listen we don't gain anything by concealing our sin and addictions matter of fact we go backwards the Bible says when we hide our addictions we will not Prosper Prosperity doesn't come from concealing our addictions it comes from confessing them you will never get free by hiding your addiction you will never get free by denying it by Faking It by getting defensive about it by covering up if you want to be free you have to own it humble yourself and be honest about your addiction number three the third step is own running and staying away from your addiction running and staying away Luke 8 33 it says then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs and the entire herd plunged down a steep Hillside into the lake and drowned I'm not sure how this man even got possessed by so many demons but here's what I know is that when he was set free and they came out of him and went into the pigs he didn't go running after the pigs and chasing the pigs no no if you read on in that story he went running to Jesus and started following Jesus the power of God set this man free the demons were finally away from this man and now he's staying away from the demons Jesus wants to get us away from our addictions Proverbs 28:13 people who conceal their sins will not Prosper but if they confess and turn from them they will receive Mercy one of the necessary steps to Breaking Free from sinful habits to break free from an addiction is to eliminate our access to them run away throw it away get away from it stay away don't go to the parties get rid of the movie channels cancel cable delete the gambling apps and block them get some accountability software on your computer iPad or your phone so you don't even have access to pornography don't have the internet on your phone don't drive the route home from work past the liquor store change your cell phone number block and erase their number you know who there is come on a rasing a block that drug dealer's number number out of your phone change jobs cut up the credit cards erase the filthy music off your devices don't walk down the ice cream aisle or the Little Debbie aisle I know the grocery stores do us dirty now they put them right up at the front where the checkout is so your children and people like me Jamie don't send me grocery shopping have a basket full of fud drown Star Crunch oatmeal cream pies and zebra cakes don't go down the aisle give your spouse complete access to your computer email your social media accounts your phone delete your social media accounts you can live without them stay away from the bar turn turn off your phone when you get home whatever the addiction is you got to own it you got to run away and you got to stay away you know one of the things I had to cut off access to were certain people I had to cut some people out of my life I had to cut some people that wanted to go drinking and partying and getting drunk and all that stuff no no I had to I had to cut off the access you got to turn away get away run away and stay away from the sin own it and eliminate your access number four own replacing bad habits with good habits Luke 8:35 it says the people rushed out to see what had happened a crowd soon gathered around Jesus and they saw the man who had been free from the demons he was sitting at Jesus's feet fully clothed and perfectly sane I don't want you to miss this earlier we read about we read about how this man was just running around naked now he's got clothes on how many yall know he traded in a bad habit for a good habit I'd say running around naked is a bad habit he got some clothes on he he he he replaced a bad habit with a good habit and if you have an addiction you need to be honest allow the power of God to set you free eliminate aess and then replace bad habits with good habits Ephesians 4: 22- 24 the Bible says throw off your old sinful nature throw it off and your former way of life which is corrupted by lust and deception instead let the spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes put on your new nature created to be like God truly righteous and holy replace bad habits with good habits replace your old sinful nature with your new nature created to be like God listen instead of going to the party on a Saturday night and staying up late stay home read a book watch a show go to bed before midnight so you could be on time to church on Sunday morning

start a business pray and fast replace bad habits with good habits put off your old self and put on your new self created to be like God one of the things I did that helped me to quit partying and drinking and all the things I'm doing is I got involved in church plain and simple I was there every Wednesday night and I was there all Sunday morning I got on the Dream Team I got like on four dream teams where do you need me I got too much time on my hands I will get into some mess that I don't I don't want to be in any mess anymore I want to be in God's will I'm done with the devil's mess and I want to be in God's Will and so I went through the growth track I got on the Dream Team was I perfect man I had all kinds of earth shoes okay all kinds but I got on the Dream Team I got discipled I got into a small group replace bad habits with good habits number five fifth step own surrounding yourself with godly people Luke 8:35 it says the people rushed out to see what had happened a crowd Su gathered around Jesus and they saw the man who had been freed from the demons he was sitting at Jesus's feet this man was no longer hanging out with dead people and demons he was now sitting at the feet of Jesus he's now hanging out with Jesus and his disciples a major step to getting free is staying free is surround yourself with the right people you will have a an extremely difficult time breaking free and staying free if you don't get godly people in your life listen don't surround yourself with people who are where you are surround yourself with people who are where you want to be replace negative influences with Godly influences this was also a game Cher for me I had to change all of my friends I had to I had to I had to change all the friends that wanted to party I had to stop hanging out with all my friends that wanted to party and get drunk and get high and all that stuff and I had to get around get some new group of friends and you know what all a sudden I found friends they wanted to pray I found some friends they want to do a Bible study together what I found friends they wanted to go to worship concert I found friends that are like oh yeah we going back for deeper night oh yeah we going to get some more Jesus today Sunday is not enough all of a sudden I got friends now they want to do prayer meetings and pray and read our Bible and we're going to church and and we're serving together we're going on missions trips together listen 1 Corinthians 15:33 the Bible the word of God says do not be misled Bad Company corrupts good character no matter how bad you want to be free if you surround yourself with the wrong people they will pull you down the right people will pull pull you up that's why being in a small group is so important we just started our small group semester go online go on our app find a small group for you if you can't find one of the groups just come on Wednesday night come to Brotherhood come to Sisterhood we're learning about Discerning the voice of God living out God's will we're learning about how to overcome spiritual warfare listen get around godly people we have freedom groups on Thursday night get in a group you have to surround yourself with people that will have a Godly influence on your life and then number six the sixth step own following Jesus one day at a time Luke 8: 38-39 it said the man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him but Jesus sent him home saying no go back to your family and tell them everything God has done for you so he went through through went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him Jesus set this man free and told him to go live for God every day one day at a time go and proclaim the great things God has done for you listen living a life of freedom is about serving Jesus One Day at a Time One Day at a Time Luke 9:23 Jesus then he said to the crowd if any of you wants to be my follower you must turn from your selfish ways take up your cross daily and follow me living a life of freedom is all about following Jesus one day at a time don't focus on how you're going to stay free in 2025 or 2026 or 2030 no no no freedom is about picking up your cross and following Jesus today one day at a time if you want to be free for a year you got to have some free months if you want to be free for a month you have to be free for some weeks if you want to be free for a week you have to be free for some days and if you want to be free for days you have to start by being free today just one day one day at a time Own It own it one day at a time one day at a time following Jesus every day own it pick up your cross daily and follow Jesus listen I've had my different addictions in life and I'm telling you none of them there was just like instant Freedom every one of them was a process every one of them was one day at a time every one of them there were some good days and there were some bad days every one of them there was times where I did well and I was doing good and then I slipped up and I messed up and you know what I did I just started over the next day one day at a time one foot after the next one day at a time one week at a time one month at a time one day at a time following Jesus I'm telling you right now if you'll just start one day at a time taking it day by day following Jesus taking up your cross daily he will help you it won't be perfect it won't be easy it'll be hard it'll be challenging but With God all things are possible Jesus can set you free you can be free you can get your life back together you can be just like that man that was bound and addicted running around naked and crazy and all this stuff and all of a sudden Jesus set him free and he's sitting at the feet of Jesus fly clothed perfectly sane and Jesus says go and just day by day he went and he proclaimed and he lived for God one day at a time but we got to own it we got to own going to Jesus we got to own admitting being honest about our addiction we got to own running away staying away we got to own replacing bad habits with good habits we got to own surrounding oursel with godly people and own and we're going to follow Jesus one day at a time
gRkVxpR0GJE,well today we are continuing our series called I wish I would have and the title of my message today is I wish I would have shared my faith I wish I would have shared my faith I will never forget when I had my first cup of coffee I was in high school felt like I wanted you know I needed to be a little bit more grown you know what I mean y'all remember those commercials you know it's Folgers in your cup y'all remember those you know what I mean and they got the person holding it in the you know the steams rising and they're um and they're just like taking this sip it just looks like the most euphoric experience and so I remember one morning I was finally my dad was always drinking coffee and he's like what are you doing so I'm getting some coffee poured it in the coffee mug took a sip ah how do you drink this stuff I mean it was just it was a horrible experience I mean it was bitter it was gross that was the last hot cup of coffee it was my first and my last I'm like oh that is my dad was like well then put my dad drink it black he's like well put some cream in it I suppose it didn't matter oh it was it was horrible and that was around the time where Starbucks finally came to Indianapolis 99 was when Starbucks came to India I remember everybody was talking about Starbucks this and start I'm like that's nasty I ain't I ain't spending any of my dollars on that now I mean car oh how could y'all do that and Jamie my wife we were friends at this time she became uh like an assistant manager at a Starbucks and she worked there used to be a Starbucks on 96 in Allisonville and all the time she's like you need to come to my Starbucks I'm like no I ain't going that's why would I spend money on that nastiness and she's like I promise you if you come I will make you a drink that you will love I was like whatever I'm not doing it but finally one time I I showed up and she's like all right I'm gonna make your drink it's you're gonna love it and so she cut it was not a it was not a mug with some hot coffee it was this tall thing with whipped cream and drizzle all over it she's like this is a Java Chip Frappuccino I'm like a frappel what oh like now it's common language but back then a frappuccino sounded like something from outer space you know what I mean and but man I took a sip of that thing it was delicious I was like okay I was like how much is this drink it was like five dollars I'm like oh brother can't afford that I can't be doing nah I can't be doing that and then she says well have you ever tried iced coffee I'm like iced coffee no she's like do you like coffee ice cream like I've had it a time or two she's like okay let me get make you an iced coffee so she made me an iced coffee with cream and Sweet and Low and that day a match was made in heaven 23 years later I think almost daily I I still don't like hot hot ugh but iced coffee with some cream oh man that's my jam every single it's one of my favorite drinks and when many Christians think about the idea of sharing their faith it's like my first coffee experience it sounds like it will be a horrible experience you know what I mean some of you think right now Pastor I've heard about those people who share their faith yeah their main screaming at folks turn a burn you're going to hell you know what I mean they're outside with signs and screaming and and megaphones or you were a waiter or a waitress and you were like oh my goodness they gave me a 20 tip and you went to grab that 20 and all of a sudden it unfolded and you realize it was a track that was like Jesus loves you and no tip was left with it oh this is wrong it's weird like why like oh yeah I know about those people who share their faith and church I want you to know there's a better way there's a better way and I want to teach you a life-giving way to share your faith but before I do I first want to give you some common traps that will keep you from sharing your faith and so I want to study a portion of scripture in John chapter 4 where a woman put her faith in Christ Jesus used a life-giving approach that connected with her but he had to overcome the common traps that keep people from sharing their faith and so here's the first trap the first trap is the Trap of busyness the Trap of busyness John 4 4 it says now he had to go through Samara if you read the story in the context Samaria was out of the way but the Bible says he had to go through Samaria and in the midst of everything that Jesus had happening in his ministry Healing The Sick preaching the gospel casting out demons helping the hurting Jesus made it a priority to go through Samaria because he was going to meet a woman who needed grace mercy and forgiveness Jesus went out of his way for one woman he didn't allow the Trap of busyness to keep him from telling a lady about the good news and you and I can't let the Trap of busy lives can keep us from sharing our faith we forget what God has called us and told us to do look at Mark chapter 16 verse 15. it says he said to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation listen this command wasn't just for Jesus's disciples it's not just for pastors or church leaders no no this is for every Christ follower we are called to preach the gospel to share our faith but we can get so busy raising kids with work education bills problems life and we easily forget why we're here that God saved us so that we could be a part of Saving others that God rescued us so that we can rescue others that is why we're here and so we got to be careful don't get caught by the Trap of busyness number two is the Trap of rejection the Trap of rejection look back at John 4 verse 7 through 9 it says when a Samaritan woman came to draw water Jesus said to her will you give me a drink his disciples had gone into the town to buy food the Samaritan woman said to him you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman how can you ask me for a drink for Jews do not associate with Samaritans see Jews and Samaritans they didn't interact with each other they didn't like one another so a Jewish man certainly wouldn't be talking to a Samaritan woman but Jesus started a conversation with these with this lady and she's like why are you talking to me you're a Jew s don't talk to us Samaritans I mean she might have even thought Jesus was hitting on her you know what I mean like she there at the water all of a sudden Jesus rose up like can I get a drink yeah you can get your own drink asking me for a drink over here with your long hair and your beard trying to talk to me I ain't getting fooled I ain't getting food but it's Jewish I mean I mean I don't know if that's how it went down but I'm just telling you I'll let maybe once One Day in heaven Jesus can you just reshow us that incident because you realize how that could have came across and but anyway she's like I'm not giving you any water but Jesus didn't allow the Trap of rejection to keep him from sharing the good news he took the risk of being rejected because he knew this lady needed Grace and forgiveness I'll never forget it was about five years ago leading up to Easter and when we were back at Fall Creek Valley Middle School Easter weekend we would do this Outreach called Easter land and we had invite cards for it and uh and so anytime I ran into somebody that had kids I was like hey we have this free Outreach Easter weekend Easter land if you want to come and I was at the uh chiropractor one day and when I was leaving I saw a mom there with her two children I thought oh I need to invite them to Easter land and I normally had invite cards in my pocket but that more that morning I didn't have any and I was like well I guess the Lord didn't want me to invite her and so I just walked uh right on by and I remember just getting to my car and just feeling convicted a member of the Lord just telling me Go invite her and I'm like but I just I was just in there I walked past her that's gonna be awkward she don't think I'm a weirdo like dude why are you coming back in here and like like you know just all these thoughts like I just started fearing rejection what if she says no I mean I got to grab a card and go all the way back in and so I just had this whole dialogue but thankfully I was like all right you know what I I needed to go do it because here's the thing at the end of the day God was like so what if she says no what if she says yes you know what I mean like at least you tried and you made an invite and you never know how I'm gonna work through that and so I I swallowed my fear of rejection my pride I grabbed the card I went back inside I said hey I know you just saw me leave this place but I saw you and and your children and our church is doing a a free Outreach I just want to invite you guys and she took the card and she said you know what I've been thinking I need to get back in to church and this is what I needed and me and my family will be there they were not only there they've gotten plugged into people's Church she got baptized her kids loved coming her kids were waking her up like we need to go to church today listen don't let the Trap of rejection you never know when someone's gonna say yes and I know we got these invite cards on your seats and some of you you leave them there because you're like well I don't know what do they say me no listen you just what if they say yes would you grab this stack you never know how God will use your invite invite invite invite everybody that you can number three third trap is the Trap of not knowing enough the Trap of not knowing enough this woman immediately started asking Jesus questions look at John 4 verse 11 through 12. sir the woman said you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep where can you get this living water are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself as did also his sons in livestock I want you to see what she says to Jesus in verse 20 John 4 20 our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem I mean this lady began to question Jesus she had reasoning she had logic she knew Religion she said you don't even have anything to draw water with you think you're great now I know how you Jews worship I know religion you can't tell me anything and obviously if you read on in that story Jesus has some great answers to her questions and I know what some of y'all thinking that's the problem Pastor I'm Not Jesus and we can fall into the Trap of not sharing our faith because we think we need to have all the answers I mean people might ask me something I don't know to argue with me they'll debate religion with me Pastor I just don't know enough to share my faith I can't share my faith someone else needs to share Jesus with my family my friends and my co-workers and our insecurities can stop us from sharing the best news ever so I want to help you today I want to help you overcome these traps by learning how to share your faith in a life-giving way and so I'm going to give you five life-giving ways to share your faith five life-giving ways to share your faith number one is this don't judge people love people don't judge people love people the lady in this story was all by herself at the well in the middle of the day it was the hottest part of the day you might be thinking like why listen she was there at the hottest part of the day because she was dealing with shame and regret she was an outcast she was trying to avoid people everybody else in the town was going to get water in the morning or in the evening when it was cool outside but she's dealing with shame and regret she's already have five husbands the man she's with right now she's not even married to and so she's hurting she's in pain she feels like an outcast she is trying to avoid everybody and so she's going when no one is there and Jesus said I have to go to Samaria and he went with the right mindset and heart he went there to love her not judge her he went to help not hurt her if anyone could have judged her it was Jesus I mean he's perfect but he and judge her he loved her a life-giving approach to sharing your faith begins with loving people not judging people you need to remember it's God's love and kindness that leads people to repentance look at Romans chapter 2 verse 4. it says don't you see how wonderfully kind tolerant and patient God is with you does this mean nothing to you can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin how many of y'all remember Blockbuster Video now you remembering block if you've never heard of Blockbuster let me let me show you a little something something blocked Buster video man I remember when I first got my Blockbuster card you know it's like a rite of passage I got my I can go rent videos and so back in the day there was Blockbuster and you had to go there to rent your VHS tapes to to watch movies and on the Blockbuster case the VHS that's what's inside of it and on the case it had a phrase it said be kind and Rewind be kind and Rewind because when you were done watching that video if you'd put it in and Rewind it that would be kind towards the person that rented it next so they can watch it from the beginning and they don't have to rewind it itself be kind and Rewind church this statement is what I try to live by when I'm sharing my faith I remember I rewind and remember where God has brought me from I remind my mind and remember I was messed up I was filthy I was a mess I was broken I was lost but Jesus saved me how can I judge anybody else we gotta rewind we gotta go back we gotta show some Grace and we gotta remember well God brought us out of we got to remember our mess be kind and Rewind number two initiate a conversation not an argument initiate a conversation not an argument Jesus started a conversation not an attack he asked her for a drink he didn't go after her and say oh I know why you're here all by yourself and living ratchet nasty life if you would live so wild you wouldn't have to get this water you could get it at the normal time like everybody else does listen you can't expect to win people over to Jesus by degrading them yelling at them arguing with them making them feel like a loser over their Sin calling them a failure telling them you're right and they're wrong an ancient poet said raise your words not your voice it is rain that grows flowers not Thunder it's the kindness of God initiate a conversation not an argument number three talk about something you have in common Jesus started the conversation with something they had in common they were at a well and she was drawing water so he talked about water a life-giving approach to sharing your faith is fine common ground and talk about it find something you can connect on and talk about it when you start talking to people about something they're interested in the conversation can open up their heart Jesus talked about water because water was on her mind you might need to talk to someone about their job or maybe their kids or grandkids maybe talk to them about football or basketball or video games golfing shopping a hobby maybe ask them where they grew up I've been blessed to be the the chaplain for the Lawrence North High School football team for the last five or six years and I remember when I first started there was a coach he was the safeties coach his name was uh JT and uh I was there doing talks and one day on the sideline we just got to start talking football just talking football Lawrence North football talk about the players I could see you had a deep love for the players and then he was a big Colts fan and I'm a Colts fan so we would talk about can we just talk about football all the time and what that did was that just built a relationship where one day I was able to invite JT to church and he came to church and he's still coming and he brings his family and his his daughters and he loves God and he serves God all of that happened he's now plugged in he serves on the Dream Team that all started because we just had a common interest in football come on God we matter of fact we still talk about football we are texting this week amen Lamar to the Colts what you think what you think you know we anyway but but but just a common interest can open a door to share your faith number four find an attractive way to talk about Jesus when you're talking about something you have in common look for an opportunity to share the good news Jesus found a way to make the gospel attractive and enticing for this lady he talked to her about living water John 4 10 Jesus answered her if you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink you would have asked him and he would give in you living water John 4 13-15 Jesus answered everyone who drinks this water talking about the water at the well will be thirsty again but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst indeed the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life verse 15 the woman said to him sir give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water Jesus was creative in his approach he knew she wanted water but he also knew she needed The Living Water and so he talked about both to find an attractive way to share your faith you need to know this about people everyone wants peace everyone wants joy and happiness everyone wants purpose everyone wants hope everyone wants their relationships to win everyone wants to be loved and accepted and they don't even know it but everyone wants living water when you're talking to people listen for what's missing in their life or a pain point in their life and then lovingly share the hope of Jesus maybe the person says to you man times are crazy I am so worried and stressed and you say you know I'm thankful I have peace and I really you have peace with all this craziness yeah I have peace how Jesus my relationship with Jesus I go to him and he's the only one he's helped me have peace or maybe someone talks about man my life is so hard so much trouble you're able to say you know what man my heart my life's been hard like yours in fact I wanted to quit I was ready to give up but I finally found joy what'd you do how'd you find Joy I found it a church I found it in Christ prayer and reading my Bible and it just opens this door for you to share your faith number five fifth life-giving where to share your faith remember that one changed life leads to more changed lives remember that one changed life leads to more changed lives after her experience with Jesus this woman went back to her own town and told them about Jesus look at John chapter 4 verse 39-42 it's as many of the Samaritans from the town believed in him because of the woman's testimony he told me everything I ever did so when the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with him and he stayed two days and because of his words many more became believers they said to the woman we no longer believe just because of what you said now we have heard for ourselves and we know this man really is the savior of the world because Jesus reached this woman many more people were saved a city was reached Revival broke out in this city when you reach one person for Jesus you have no idea the ripple effect sharing Jesus with your friend your co-worker your neighbor a family member that student in school and inviting them to our Easter services could literally reach an entire family an entire workplace an entire city an entire School an entire Unity reaching one person has a ripple effect come on when you grab these invite cards and you invite and somebody comes and they give their life to Jesus one invite can have a ripple effect in a family in a father and a mother that has a ripple effect and then their sons and daughters and then their sons and daughters and their sons and daughters one invite could have a ripple effect for Generations upon Generations upon Generations and I'm living proof I was invited to Abundant Life Church on 82nd and Hague I don't want to go to church didn't believe in God wasn't sure about church but I was invited for some fun they were having some fun in some basketball and so I showed up for some fun and some basketball and it took about a good year but I showed up for fun and basketball and about a year later I found Jesus and after I gave my life to Jesus my family started serving the lord I've seen family members get saved I got called to full-time Ministry and I went to be a youth pastor I I helped lead people to Jesus in Springfield Missouri then in Columbus Ohio in Oklahoma City Oklahoma it's been a ripple effect and now I'm back I'm back in the city where I was broken and lost and hurting reaching people hundreds thousands of people I wasn't even saved in high school but now I've come back and I can go into my high school and tell people about Jesus and teachers are being saved students are beings there's a ripple effect you in here you're a ripple effect someone gave their life to Christ and then they got saved and they invited you and you got saved and now your fan family comes and your friends come and your neighbors come and your kids friends come there's a ripple effect from one invite and change your life by simply sharing our faith sharing the good news of Jesus Christ because God can do so much more than we can do come on anybody thankful that they've been saved anybody thankful for the ripple effect that's hit your life that's hit your family that's in Generations upon Generations upon Generations I never want to forget what Christ did for me what he did for you how precious is the blood that he shed on Calvary so we can be saved forgiven and made whole
KjnWDGz0NUA,and so today we're continuing our series called rediscovering or reintroducing excuse me reintroducing the Holy Spirit we've been learning so much and if you missed a week I would encourage you to to go back I know even as I have been studying I've just been learning a lot more about the Holy Spirit and I hope that you've been learning as you've been watching to watching the teachings and listening to them and the title of my message today is you need power and so to start off this message I need to know how many all are team iPhones we're about team iPhone we got team iPhone people in the house okay we got quite a few a team how about team Galaxy we got a new team Galaxy people in there okay okay we got a couple of team team Galaxy folks in the house and one of our attenders I saw a post she put on uh social media where her and her son were having a discussion uh maybe a little friendly argument about what's better uh iPhone or or Droid or Galaxy and uh she she said she was talking Galaxy versus iPhone with their son yeah here's what she said she said God created the Galaxy and Eve bit the Apple now look at the back of your phone and tell me what's really going on oh oh okay almost almost got me to switch but y'all I can't learn something new I'm a I am team iPhone all day long and I got the iPhone 14.

euchre on my phone I do play some euchre 3D but anyway uh but I'm I'm like what in the world like my battery it won't even make it past noon and I don't know what's going on it's a matter if I start doing research I'm like so I've been they're like put it on low power mode and make sure you got Auto refresh off I was Googling trying to figure out what in the world why is my battery not lasting very long and I was actually at a I was at a pastor's conference um but it was it was during the work week and so at that conference I was getting a lot of work text messages and so I'm responding and I'm answering and I got a number of work texts coming in important texts coming in and my phone dies and we're sitting in this Auditorium and there were no plugs there were no plugs there was nowhere to plug in I'm like oh man what am I gonna do and my buddies he's like hey I'll give you a charger I said man there ain't no outlets around here he said oh it's okay I have a portable charger I should say what let me see that and he pulls out this portable charger plugs it into my phone and it starts charging I'm like oh I need me one of those and my kids heard my cry and this Father's Day daddy oh I got my portable phone charger all day every day I don't got to worry about my phone going red or dying on me anytime it gets low I just pull out my portable charger and I charge it right I don't even need an outlet matter of fact a couple weeks ago we were in Oklahoma City and some massive storms came by while we were sleeping power went out woke up that morning my phone wasn't charged because it was plugged into the wall none of our phones were charged none of the power was working but I had my portable phone charger oh yeah hey Dad can we borrow that poor power's out all day long but I have power I was able to charge my I didn't have to worry about going on red because I had my portable phone charger all day every day I got power to keep my phone charged this last week we went to an Indianapolis Indians game and uh I I don't go downtown often but may I go down for you know Colts game or Indians game and um I've noticed the last couple times I've gone down to use a parking garage they no longer a lot of them don't have people anymore matter of fact this parking garage I had to pay online and they give you a QR code I'm like man is this gonna work you know I'm pulling up to this box and it's got this red you know sensor there and but I do it I put my QR code beep beep the thing goes up I was able to park I was like oh wow look at that that's cool so park I'm at the game we're having fun Indians won and we're walking back to the parking garage and we're walking up to it and I'm like oh yeah I need my QR code and I pull up my phone dead and I didn't have my portable phone charger I'm like Jamie I don't know how we're gonna get out of this garage and so we're we're getting up to the car we pulled out and there's like push button for assistance you know what I mean I'm like and we happen to have like a leftover old charger in the in the van that hadn't worked this thing ain't worked and I don't know how long I'm like plug it in maybe it'll maybe it'll work man she's like it's not working so I have to wait there for the lady lady comes on you just have to pay again I'm like already paid what do you mean you come on you don't trust me like how you think I got in here I had a QR code and out of nowhere it got like a one percent charge and so boop boop I got out of there but man I had no power I was on red I was about to get stuck in a parking garage because I did not have my portable when I got this portable charger I don't ever have to worry about my phone going on red I don't have to ever worry about it dying on me I have power I have access to power it up all day long and a lot of Christians they run their spiritual life on low in the red because they don't stay plugged in to the power of the Holy Spirit some they didn't even know that the Holy Spirit was a our source some neglected some forgot some didn't realize that they have access to it all day every day for the rest of their life some are looking for other sources of power instead of the Holy Spirit and this is why Paul said in Ephesians 5 18 don't be drunk with wine because that will ruin your life instead be filled with the Holy Spirit The Message Bible says drink the spirit of God huge drots of him the Bible is saying we need to continually be filled with the Holy Spirit you stay powered up by staying plugged in to the holy spirit's power Jesus stayed plugged into the holy spirit's power matter of fact Jesus didn't select his 12 disciples nor did he perform one Miracle until after the power of the Holy Spirit rested on him look at Matthew chapter 3 verse 16. it says after his baptism as Jesus came up out of the water the heavens opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him after the Holy Spirit rested on Jesus he was then tempted by the devil in the wilderness for 40 days after the 40 days ends Luke records these words look at Luke 4 14. it says Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the spirit and news about him spread through the whole Countryside Jesus came out of 40 days of prayer and fasting full of the power of the spirit look at acts 10 38 it talks about how John the Baptist preached how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and and power and he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because God was with him Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit the early church had to stay plugged into the power of the Holy Spirit look at First Corinthians 2 4 it says my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirit's power Romans 15 19 it says by the power of signs and wonders through the power of the spirit of God some from Jerusalem all the way to illyricum have I have fulfilled I have fully proclaimed man that word you Scholars can tell me how to say that but it messed me up I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ Romans 15 13 it says may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and he says you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit First Corinthians 4 20 it says for the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power the kingdom of God is about the power of the Holy Spirit not human power but the power of God second Timothy 1 7 for the spirit of God does not make us timid but gives us power love and self-discipline first Thessalonians 1 5 because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction acts 1 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my Witnesses in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the Earth God wants us to stay full of the holy spirit's power so that you Can Be an Effective witness everywhere you go come on people need Jesus people need salvation people need to experience the power of God and God's plan is for his power to flow through your life to be a witness to a lost hurting and broken world and the only way You Can Be an Effective witness is to stay plugged into the holy spirit's power you can't overcome the devil and sin and live with Supernatural power to be a witness on your own you must stay plugged in to the power of the holy spirit so I want to give you three ways the power of the Holy Spirit helps you be a witness three ways the power of the Holy Spirit helps you be a witness number one is this the holy spirit's power cleans us up the holy spirit's power cleans us up in Acts 1 8 it says we need the power of the Holy Spirit to be Witnesses the holy spirit's power is what makes you a witness to a broken world now I want you to notice he's called the Holy Spirit everybody say holy not the wicked spirit not the filthy Spirit not the nasty Spirit not the spooky Spirit the holy spirit is Holy and he makes you holy he never leads us to be Unholy he always leads you to be more holy to be more like Jesus the holy spirit's power it cleans us up you can't make yourself holy I can't make myself holy if we try to live holy on our own we will fail miserably the holy spirit is what makes you holy from start to finish from the inside to the outside from the top to the bottom the work of becoming holy is the work of the Holy Spirit and you have to stay plugged into the power of the Holy Spirit to become more and more holy second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 it says as for us we can't help but thank God for you dear brothers and sisters loved by the Lord we're always thankful that God chose you to be among the first to experience salvation a Salvation that came through the spirit who makes you holy and through your belief in the truth Romans 15 16 says I am a special messenger from Christ to you Gentiles I bring you the good news so that I might present you as an acceptable offering to God made Holy by the Holy Spirit First Peter 1 2 it says God the Father who knew you and chose you long ago and his Spirit has made you holy as a result you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ may God give you more and more grace and peace the holy spirit makes you want to obey God the Holy Spirit doesn't just make us holy he makes us want to be holy it's no longer I have to be holy it's I want to be holy it's no longer I have to please God I want to please God he changes your have to to want to before I gave my life to Jesus I was the hot mess Express anger issues filthy mouth cussing all the time addicted to sexual sin I had all kinds of issues and you know what happened the moment I gave my life to Jesus I still was the hot mess Express except I was forgiven before I was the unforgiving hot mess Express but the moment I gave my life to Jesus I was the forgiving hot mess Express but you know what happened after I gave my life to Jesus the Holy Spirit came inside of me and I finally understood there was a Holy Spirit and I began to ask to help the holy spirit because I could not clean up this tongue on my own I could not quit cussing on my own I could not get over my anger on my own I could not resist sexual Temptation on my own I needed the power of the Holy Spirit I had to ask the Holy Spirit every day to fill me to help me to lead me on my own I wouldn't have got anywhere I would have stayed hot mess Express but with the help of the Holy Spirit he's changed me he's helping me he's cleaned me up it's with the help it's with the help guess what today he's still helping me okay there's still some times I want to get in my flesh there's still sometimes I got to ask for the help of the Holy Spirit his power it cleans us up and I'm at a point now again and for many years I want to be holy I want to please God I want to be a Godly dad and a Godly husband and a Godly pie and I can't do it without the help of the holy spirit so the holy spirit's power cleans us up number two the holy spirit's power fills us up it's important to understand that at Salvation you are sealed with the Holy Spirit according to Ephesians 1 13. then in Acts 1 8 the Bible talks about the second experience with the Holy Spirit called the baptism of the Holy Spirit every Christ follower should ask God to baptize them in the Holy Spirit last Sunday I did a whole message on the baptism of the Holy Spirit I would encourage you to go watch it on our YouTube page but then after you are baptized in the Holy Spirit Ephesians 5 18 says you need to be continually filled with the Holy Spirit this iPhone smartphones they can accomplish a whole lot when they're charged I can communicate I can call people I can do work from my phone send out emails I can pay bills I can play I mean there's so much when this phone is charged up there is so much I can do but when it is not charged it is completely ineffective now some of you your smartphone is so big that when it's not charged it could still be a self-defense weapon you know what I mean somebody tried all right but y'all you ever been there you trying to pay a bill or send a text are you trying to get some information and all of a sudden you just it's red you see the one on there you're like oh you do your thumbs they never move faster trying to get it out and then the screen goes dark no no you ready just throw your phone down if you have insurance just throw it you don't got insurance no no you throw something else but it's ineffective when it's not charged the early church were effective Witnesses because they stayed full of the power of the Holy Spirit acts 11 24 he referring to Barnabas it says he was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and Faith with a great number of people were brought to the Lord why does it say full of the Holy Spirit because it's possible to not be full acts 6 3 brothers and sisters choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the spirit and wisdom we will turn this responsibility over to them why does it say full because not everybody there was full not everybody is full acts 4 8 it says then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit acts 39 Saul also know so Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit acts 13 52 the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit the early church was constantly being filled with the Holy Spirit they didn't stop at Salvation or with the baptism of the Holy Spirit they needed more wanted more they needed it every day all day every day more of the spirit of God and some of you have allowed your spiritual battery to run low and when you run low you start living by the flesh instead of by the spirit you become an ineffective witness but when you are full of the Holy Spirit your life becomes attractive when you are full of the Holy Spirit people want what you have look at Romans 15 13 it says may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit when you are filled with the Holy Spirit what oozes out of your life is joy and peace and hope and that's attractive to a world a hurting world full of Sorrow chaos turmoil and despair and they want what you have Romans 14 17 says for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit when you stay filled with the Holy Spirit your life will overflow with righteousness with peace and joy that's attractive to a lost world but when you don't stay full of the Holy Spirit What flows out of your life is unrighteousness chaos and sourness Ephesians 3 16 it says I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with the power through his spirit in your inner being when you stay filled with the holy spirit's power you have Supernatural strength the holy spirit gives you strength to endure pain trials heartache and loss and your strength becomes attractive to broken people around you they're looking at you how have you not quit how have you not given up how do you keep going on how do you got a smile on your face and if you're honest you know it's not you you know it's not you you know you know it's the holy spirit inside of you is but God it's his spirit it's his strength it is his power it is his Spirit that's getting me up every morning getting me through my day getting me through these challenges get me through this pain it's his spirit and today some of you are running low on strength Joy hope and peace because you're not staying full of the Holy Spirit your life isn't very attractive and today you need to ask God to fill you full of the Holy Spirit I'm telling you it's a game changer in my life I've been through some pain some loss some heartaches there have been times I've wanted to quit and give up and I thank God for the power of the Holy Spirit I wouldn't have made it without his power without his spirit I wouldn't have made it without his comfort without his strength I wouldn't have made it without his leading in his Direction and his guiding it's the Holy Spirit that has gotten me through it and I need it I need more I need to be filled every day I live in my parenting I need to be filled every day being a husband I need to be filled every day being a pastor I need to be filled every day I need more of his back I got to stay plugged into the power of the Holy Spirit number three the holy spirit's power pours us out look at acts 1 8 it says but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my Witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria into the ends of the Earth God says I'm filling you with power to pour you out in Jerusalem that's your city that's where you live where your address is he said in Judea that's your state here in Indiana Samaria that's your nation and to the ends of the Earth that's your world God fills us full of the holy spirit so he can pour us out to make a difference in our world see God Wants You full of the holy spirit's power because he wants to use your life to change your family he wants to use your life to change your neighborhood he wants to use your life to change your workplaces he wants to use your life to change your school let me let me talk to my students right now listen as you get ready to

out to pour you out to make a difference in your city state nation and World God wants to fill you up so we can pour you out listen if all you do is get filled up and never give out that's called constipated okay that's constipated don't be a constipated Christian God didn't call you or chose you to get filled up to keep it all in no no no no he wants to fill you up to pour it out first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse five through six it says because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction you know how he lived among you for your sake you became imitators of us and of Our Lord for you welcome the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit Paul was full of the holy spirit's power and it changed the lives around him he was filled up to be poured out first Corinthians chapter 2 verse 4 and 5 it says my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirit's power so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom but on God's power come on we don't just need human wisdom we need the power of the Holy Spirit to change our world through the holy spirit's power and the gifts of the holy spirit working through our life God wants to use you to perform signs and wonders and minister to a broken lost and hurting people come on our world is hurting our world is dark and our world needs to encounter people that are full of the holy spirit's power listen we need every single one of you that calls People's Church your home

Spirit wants to do a work in your life would you stand with me
GQ_GPpQYLHw,today as we kick off this series we're looking at good advice for a bad day we all have bad days they're unavoidable when jamie and i decided we wanted to have a third child and a member a year going by and not getting pregnant and then two years go by and things just start messing with your head you're wondering okay god what's you know what's going on what's happening and after over two years i'll remember you know it's it's it's you and you have those moments where you maybe think you're pregnant and you take the test you know and it's negative and oh and you're almost hitting points was like okay i'm not even going to take a test you know and but then you still do but i'll never forget the test that came back positive and we were so excited tears of joy praising god and you know when you get pregnant you then set up your first appointment with the doctor and uh we set up that appointment and we went in and found out that we had lost our baby and uh it was a bad day there were many bad days i remember in high school when my dad went out of town i threw a party at my house probably 20 30 plus people in my dad's one-story house and what party was over i mean i had to make sure that thing was clean and real good and i thought i was good and everything went great and then all of a sudden my dad found a beer bottle cap in some crevice busted that was not a good day that was a bad day i remember being in high school dating a girl for a year and a half and she dumped me that was a bad day the day i got a call from my mom that my nanny had cancer it's a bad day then today cancer took her life was another bad day my senior year in high school two of my classmates passed away suddenly tragically those were bad days the day i found out that a pastor or close close friend of mine had betrayed me lied to me it's a bad day i remember being in a six-hour car ride from jam with jamie my wife and we were driving back from kansas city we've been married about seven years now driving back to oklahoma just fighting and arguing the entire car ride remember her saying we can't do this anymore remembering for the first time the word divorce coming up it was a bad day we've all had bad days bad days are unavoidable have you recently had a bad day maybe you were diagnosed with a disease you wrecked your car found out found out some painful devastating news maybe one of your children struggling in school and with their friendships maybe your child spiraling out of control you got laid off at work or you're having major challenges in your businesses maybe your employees or employer is very difficult to work with maybe a loved one passed away maybe you made some stupid decisions that you regret you got served divorce papers you lost thousands of thousands of dollars in the stock market maybe you made a bad investment and lost thousands of dollars or maybe you had to file for bankruptcy we all have bad days and no matter how much you love god pray read your bible at church every single week worship the lord with all your heart you will still have bad days and i've seen a lot of christians struggle with their faith in god when they go through bad days they struggle because they believe that bad days mean that that must mean that god is not real that god doesn't love them or god isn't with them and you need to know none of those things are true that when you go through bad days god is still good and god is still for you see bad days are a part of living in this fallen world and you can bounce back from a bad day if you know how to respond to bad days see the wrong responses will take a bad day and it will turn it into a bad week a bad month a bad year a bad decade or even a bad life and many of us growing up we learned mathematics we learned science we learned how to play t-ball soccer and basketball we learned all these things but we were never taught how to respond to bad days many of us we learned how to respond to bad days from our parents relatives or friends screaming cussing fussing worry anxiety we learned by seeing them turn to the alcohol bottle or drugs or others turn into food or becoming severely depressed or suffering in their health due to bad days and so throughout this series my goal is for all of us to learn the right ways to respond to bad days so that we can bounce back everybody say bounce back you're going to learn tools to help you bounce back from bad days and i think the best person to learn from is our lord and savior jesus christ he had one of the worst days ever recorded in history in about a 12-hour period he experienced many horrible things he is more than qualified to help us get through our bad days let's look at what jesus experienced on his bad day i believe it's some things we've also experienced that have caused us to have a bad day the first is betrayal when jesus started his ministry he chose 12 disciples hand-picked hand-selected 12 disciples and one of those disciples is judas who would end up betraying jesus for 30 pieces of silver jesus spent three and a half years of his life with judas living with him investing in him in three and a half years of a friendship a mentorship judas traveled with jesus judas lived with jesus and he turned around and betrayed jesus some of you you've experienced this you've been close to somebody you've loved them you've spent time with them and they've betrayed you betrayal can hurt us deeply the second thing jesus experienced on his bad day was false accusations in mark 14 and in the other gospels we read about how people falsely accuse jesus of things that he never did he went through three different trials in front of two different kings people lied on jesus they literally made up accusations because they wanted him to be found guilty and crucified all of us know that false accusations being lied on it hurts and people will lie on you they'll talk about you to others they'll talk about you on social media they'll spread rumors and lies and gossip and hath truths and it can hurt deeply when people fall asleep when people falsely accuse you of things you never did or said the third thing he experienced was rejection in mark 14 50 it says everyone deserted jesus all of jesus followers left him his 12 disciples abandoned him uh 11 of them they abandoned him but the one that stuck around was peter and peter denied him three times rejection is painful especially rejection from a family member or close friend maybe you've been rejected or abandoned by a parent a spouse a friend it's horrible to feel alone because people have rejected you the fourth thing that jesus experienced on his bad day was abuse mark 14 and 15 and other gospels talk about how jesus was severely abused he was whipped he was flogged he was beaten but he wasn't just physically abused he was also mocked they spit in his face they blindfolded him and jabbed him they knocked him upside this the head was stick saying come on if you're the if you're the king if if you're really god come on prophesy tell us who hit you in the head he was abused so badly that the book of aziz says he was beyond recognition not even his mom could recognize him because his head and his face were so swollen his body was torn to pieces being abused physically mentally spiritually or emotionally is horrible it's painful it can leave you wounded angry confused mad and bitter and the fifth thing he experienced was humiliation they did all they could to humiliate jesus they stripped him of his clothes there were times that there were times he was more than likely naked they were spitting on him mocking him this was a bad 12 hours for jesus and jesus understands what you're going through no matter what you pray to jesus he understands he understands the pain the feelings the hurt the abandonment the betrayal the abuse the rejection and humiliation and then jesus they took him and they nailed him to the cross and crucified him jesus went through his worst day to help you overcome your worst day let me say that again jesus went through his worst day to help you overcome your worst day and i want you to notice the first words that jesus said on the cross he teaches us how to respond to bad days and throughout this series we're going to study the seven statements jesus said on the cross and we're going to learn some good advice on a bad day and so today i want you to notice the very first words he says they're found in luke chapter 23 verse 34 jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing my title for the message today is on your worst day forgive the first thing jesus did was pray a prayer of forgiveness to bounce back from a bad day the first thing that you have to do is forgive and i know some of you are thinking pastor are you kidding me you don't know what they did the pain the hurt the trauma there's just no way that i can forgive them and see so many people don't forgive because they have a wrong understanding of forgiveness and so i want to help you today there's a lot of things that people think forgiveness is that it's not and so i want to share with you four things forgiveness is not four things forgiveness is not number one is this forgiveness is not minimizing the seriousness of what they did forgiveness is not minimizing the seriousness of what they did people think if i forgive the person i'm saying what they did was okay and it wasn't that big of a deal and that's not true the bible nor god nor forgiveness says you have to pretend like what happened wasn't that big of a deal no no no what happened to some of you is a big deal huge massive and forgiveness is not excusing the other person's behavior or making light of their behavior second thing forgiveness is not reconciliation forgiveness is not reconciliation forgiveness doesn't mean you have to go to the other person and begin a relationship again that would be a different message i would teach you on how to reconcile and restore a relationship today i'm teaching you on forgiveness and forgiveness does not mean reconciliation see reconciliation is a two-player game you have to have cooperation of the other person in order for relationship to be reconciled and that is not always possible forgiveness is a one player game it's between you and god not between you and them it's what you decide regardless of what the other person does you don't have to wait for them to say sorry because that may not happen jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing you are to forgive even while the other person is acting like a fool god i release them to you i forgive them i'm going to let this go it's not about reconciliation forgiveness is not restoring trust forgiveness is not resuming the relationship without changes forgiveness is between you and god number three forgiveness is not about doing what's fair some people don't forgive because they think forgiveness is about fairness i can't forgive them because it's not fair listen forgiveness is not giving a person what they deserve it's giving a person what they need and more importantly what you need listen none of us want what's fair let's be honest how are you glad god didn't give us what's fair come on if god gave us what's fair that would be the penalty of our sin which is hell come on can we thank god right now that he didn't give us what's fair thank him for his grace and his mercy because if i got what was fair oh lord i'd be in trouble forgiveness is not about doing what is fair it isn't about fairness and then number four forgiveness is not impossible forgiveness is not impossible see the the devil has told some of you and convinced you that you can't forgive the offense was too great the pain they caused was so horrific it's impossible for you to forgive them listen to the word of god philippians chapter 4 verse verse 13 it says i can do all this through him who gives me strength in our own strength we can't forgive but with god's strength we can forgive no matter what they've done to us and the first step the first thing that we have to do when we're going through something difficult is we have to release it to god this is so important to jesus he includes this in the lord's prayer when he was teaching his disciple what's what they should pray every single day it's the model dare it's the everyday prayer in matthew 6 12 jesus said forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us every day and especially on bad days pray a prayer of forgiveness release all of the hurt and pain every person has done to you to god you might as well every morning wake up and say lord help me to forgive the people that are going to hurt me today i don't even know who they are but i know it could happen and so lord help me right now to have a posture of forgiveness see i don't think we can hear this enough because in life we're going to be constantly hurt and offended by others and if you don't practice forgiving everyone who hurts you a bad day can turn into a bad week a bad month a bad year a bad decade or even a bad life we have to forgive those who hurt us and so i want to give you four forgiveness lessons from jesus four forgiveness lessons from jesus the first lesson is this pray for them pray for them jesus says in luke 6 28 bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you matthew 5 44 it says but i tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you pray for the person who hurt you so i'm like oh i got this one pastor i'm good i pray for them lord i pray their house burns down in the god i pray all four tires of their car go flat lord i pray when they're sleeping cockroaches crawl up their nose and just give birth to babies in there no i'm just those are not the prayers those are not the prayers that we are talking about if you're going to live a life of forgiveness you have to learn to pray for the people who hurt you pray lord i ask you to touch them today god i ask you to change their life god i ask you to do a work inside of them and you may never see them change but if you start praying those prayers you will see you change you may never see them change you start praying those prayers you will see you change in fact it's impossible to keep hating someone when you keep praying for them just listen you you'll never know the power of this you'll never know the power of this until you start doing this but i'm telling you if you will start praying for them if you'll follow the forgiveness lessons of jesus he will help you and jesus he didn't stop there he took it up a notch as he teaches us how to live a life of forgiveness he doesn't teach just to pray for them number two bless them luke 6 28 he says bless those who curse you in romans 12 13 bless those who persecute you persecute you bless and do not curse one of the meanings of the word bless is to speak well of that means i will not let a curse come out of my mouth about the person who hurt me both privately and publicly i will not speak a curse over their life instead i will speak well of my enemy i will bless those who persecute me i will bless and not curse here's what i've learned about forgiveness it takes an act of the mind before it takes an act of your emotions see your emotions won't feel like praying for them your emotions will not feel like blessing them your emotions have you feeling like you're gonna retaliate against the person and curse them don't let your feelings keep you from forgiving even when you don't feel like it pray for them and speak blessings instead of curses if you do this eventually your emotions will follow what i've had to learn and do is pray and bless until it went from my head to my heart i'll be honest with you don't know what's starting to hurt but oftentimes it's in the head and i got to keep praying and i kind of keep blessing until it goes from my head to my heart i got some people right now that have hurt me that i've been praying and i'm free but it's not in my heart yet i'll be honest with you it's i'm just i'm i'm doing it because i know that's what god's word says and i know that's what's going to bless me and help me and help me learn to forgive and help me have peace is again if if you'll start it with your head it'll eventually go down into your heart but but jesus didn't stop there he took it up another latch as he teaches us how to live a life of forgiveness number three do good to them luke 6 27 but to who you are listening i say love your enemies do good to those who hate you luke chapter 6 verse 35-36 it says beloved your enemies do good to them and lend to them without expecting to get anything back then your reward will be great and you will be children of the most high because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked be merciful just as your father is merciful in romans chapter 12 verse 17 through 21 it says do not repay anyone evil for evil be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone if it is possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone do not take revenge my dear friends but leave room for god's wrath for it is written it is mine to avenge i will repay says the lord on the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink in doing this you will keep burning coals on his head do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good i don't know if you've heard joyce meyer's testimony but it's pretty powerful she shared her story about how she was raped by her dad over 200 times this is horrible horrific painful devastating and as an adult when joyce meyer's ministry took off she was confronted with this principle of doing good to those who persecute you she had an estranged relationship with her parents but she went to them her dad never once apologized for what he did for her but the holy spirit led her to take care of her parents financially she took care of their housing groceries and insurance then the lord told her to build her parents a house right next door to her and she took care of them until the day they died right before her dad died on his deathbed he said honey i'm sorry for what i did to you and he gave his life to jesus that's doing good to those who persecute you that's what forgiveness looks like do good to them and then number four the fourth forgiveness lesson we learn from jesus do good to you do good to you in matthew chapter 6 verse 14 and it says for if you forgive other people when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive others their sins your father will not forgive your sins listen when you don't forgive others you only hurt yourself so do good to you and forgive others see forgiveness is not a gift to give to others it's a gift to give yourself you will receive god's forgiveness when you forgive you'll have the weight and burden of unforgiveness and hate and bitterness lifted off of you when you forgive you'll be able to move forward in life when you forgive you'll be able to live out god's plan and purpose for your life when you forgive listen you can't face what's happening today if you don't settle what happened yesterday can't face what's happening today if you don't settle what's happened yesterday you have to settle the pain of yesterday so you don't miss the promises of today don't let the pain of the past rob you of god's promises for today forgiveness doesn't change the past but it will change your future where would i be today my soul my ministry my family if i haven't forgiven others that have hurt me i'd be in a bad place with still a lot of bitterness and anger and i thank god today that even though i've had some bad days and some of those have been caused by others that have done things that i would never wish on anybody else i know i'm better today i know i have peace today i know my soul is better today my family my ministry my future is better because i've forgiven and listen i'm not telling you it's easy it is hard it is painful it takes sometimes months to go from your head to your heart sometimes it takes years to go from your head to your heart but what i've learned is that when i follow god's word god has helped me to bounce back that a bad day i thank god didn't turn into a bad month or bad year or bad decade or bad life because i chose to forgive think about jesus he's on the cross looking thinking about people that have betrayed him abandoned him right there in front of him people are mocking him the men that flogged him and nailed him to the cross and he says father forgive them i know there are some thems they have hurt you they have left wounds that are deep and wide and jesus shows us by example how do you find healing father forgive them
qJklYYiLLpQ,today um I want to teach you the top five lessons I've learned about generosity typ Five Lessons that I've learned about generosity and Jamie and I we lead by example we are tithers we're giving thousands of dollars in the miracle offering this November uh God has taught us so much about living a generous life and I want to share my top five lessons and I believe it's going to minister to your heart and help you grow closer to God and as I teach from my own life and from scriptures don't don't get all up tight because I'm talking about generosity okay some people can get weird when pastors talk about money come on just look at your neighbor just don't get weird okay don't get weird don't get weird you know and I I understand why some people get uptight because some preachers have been weird some preachers have wrong motives or wrong teaching when it comes to generosity but my heart is really to help you grow stronger in your faith and I just want to teach you from the top five lessons I've learned the top five generosity principles I've learned over the years here's the first thing I've learned about generosity is the principle of the heart the principle of the heart I'll never forget the first offering I ever gave in a church service I was 18 years old I was newly saved I was on fire for God I mean the church doors were open I was there and it was a Sunday night and there was a missionary there and they were going to collect an offering at the end to help with this mission's work to spread the good news of Jesus Christ around the world and I I had a job at that time praise the Lord I was 18 and I was working at KD furniture I was uh I worked in their delivery truck I helped deliver uh the furniture and I I I remember that night I remember opening up my wallet and I had 22s I had $40 how many you know for a college hey $40 hey that was and I'm like you know what I'mma give half I'mma give 20 and I was feeling pretty good about myself I mean that's half my money for the week me I'm $40 is my gas it's my food it's whatever else I'm going to give $20 and I remember I had to I pulled out the 20 I closed the wallet and I'm waiting for them to call us up for the offering and then I felt the nudge of the Holy Spirit heard God say give it all and I'm but Lord we going to Chili's after church you know you know how we do it on Sunday night you know I got to eat I got my I got my gas I was going to IUPUI I'm like I be up God I'm trying to drive downtown you know I'm just like and I remember I just just I started wrestling with God a little bit I'm like man that's half that's a lot God said Give It All give it all and I had 120 in my hand and had another 20 in the wallet and the moment came they it was one of those uh Services where you they I think they had baskets up front you could just walk up to the front and drop your offering and I remember before I walked up I grabbed the other 20 I walked up and I put the $40 in the offering basket and I made a decision to just trust the Lord knew in my faith don't even really understand it all but man really felt God said gave it all and so I gave it all and then I'm like hey anybody want to share their chilies with me hey hey you gonna eat you gonna eat all them chips you go well somebody get the bottomless bottomless chips with saler the next day I went to work and again I worked at KD furniture delivery and I'd been working at k for a number of months and and they they pray pretty good for delivery company and um you don't get tips it's not something that it's never happened I've never in all my time working there never ever gotten a tip and it was towards the end of our run uh we delivered some furniture and um a lady was there and she asked us to move some furniture out of the house as well for put it on the curb uh we did it and then and then she handed us uh an envelope and and and and opened it up and it was $55 for my partner and then $55 for me and I remember holding that $55 I remember tears welling up in my eyes immediately God took me back to the previous day I was wrestling and struggling Chris will you trust me will you give it all never gotten tips before this was not a normal thing and I'll just never forget it thankfully my my my delivery driver buddy was a a Christian cuz he would have been like hey man what's wrong with you I I was emotional I was literally tears and and I was able just to share with him what he did and I'll never forget it because what I learned in that moment is giving is a heart issue not an income issue and I thank God at 18 years old at 18 years old I got to learn the principle that giving is more of a heart issue than an income issue and listen it has helped me cultivate a heart of generosity for my entire life one of the lessons I've learned is be generous right where we are be generous right where we are don't wait to be generous because gener being generous is a heart issue not an income issue and Jamie and I we have followed this principle our entire marriage we not only uh tithe but we give offerings like crazy even we were in in debt up to our eyes we've always given offerings and I'm so glad we did because it it developed a a heart of generosity inside of us look what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1-3 it says and now brothers and sisters we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches in the midst of a very severe trial their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in Rich generosity for I testify that they gave as much as they were able and even be on their ability entirely on their own they had extreme poverty and yet they were rich in generosity because being generous isn't about your income it's about your heart and if we're not intentionally generous our hearts will naturally drift into greed look Look what Jesus said in Luke 12:1 15- 21 it says then he said to them watch out be on guard against all kinds of greed life does not consist in an abundance of possessions and he told him this Parable the ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant Harvest he thought to himself what shall I do I have no place to store my crops then he said this is what I'll do I'll tear down my Barns and build bigger ones and there I will store my Surplus grain this man was focused only on himself his bank accounts his savings his new car his new home his retirement his food in the refrigerator and I'll say to myself you have plenty of grain laided up for many years take life easy eat drink and be married but God said to him him you fool this very night your life will be demanded from you then who will get what you have prepared for yourself this is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God now listen I don't want you to misinterpret this scripture there's nothing wrong with having savings nothing wrong with investing for the future and having margin this man's problem was the fact that he wasn't generous towards God he was only generous to himself and Jesus told him he was a fool because he was only thinking about himself he was full of greed giving kills greed in our hearts giving it kills greed in our hearts you will never meet a greedy giver and I'm so grateful at 18 years old that I learned giving is a heart issue not an income issue number two here's the second lesson that I've learned throughout life and that's the principle of Eternity I've learned that being generous towards God has helped me to live with eternity on my mind it's so easy for all of us to get focused on Earth that we lose sight of Eternity when we live only for things on earth we actually become an enemy of Christ and his plans and purpose for our lives look what Philippians 3: 18-9 says Paul says for as I have told you before and now tell you again even with tears many live as enemies of the Cross of Christ their Destiny is destruction their God is their stomach and their glory is in their shame their mind is set on Earthly things one one of the ways we set our minds on Heavenly things is by giving our time talent and treasure to build the kingdom of God look at Mark chap 10: 21- 22 Jesus looked at him and loved him one thing you lack he said go sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me at this the man's face fell he went away sad because he had great wealth this man was living with Earth on his mind he was worshiping his wealth instead of worshiping with his wealth he was rich on Earth but he was broke in heaven you can't take a U-Haul of money and possessions with you to heaven but you can send them ahead by investing your resources into the kingdom of God we often hear that life is short so you better enjoy it but I think we need to hear more of Eternity is long so you better prepare for it so we need to store up treasure in heaven Luke 12:33 sell your possessions and give to those in need this will store up treasure for you in heaven and the purses of Heaven never get old or develop holes come on any ladies excited for their purse in heaven Lord where my never gets old or has a hole your treasure will be safe no Thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it live with Heaven on your mind by giving to advance God's kingdom third lesson I've learned is this is the principle of life change Matthew 6: 19-20 Jesus says don't store up Treasures here on Earth where moths eat them and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal store your Treasures in Heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal when we give our money to God we store up treasure in heaven and I think the Great greatest treasure in heaven is going to be talking to all the people who are impacted because we invested our time our talent and our treasure into the kingdom of God I can't wait to get to heaven and meet the thousands maybe millions of people who came to faith in Christ because of people's church I can't wait to hear the stories from the ladies who are incarcerated at the Mabel Basset correctional facility and got saved because we had have church there every Sunday I can't wait wait to hear from the peoples whose lives were changed because we started churches all around the world and all across America through Ark and cmn I can't wait to hear from the children and the parents who came to Faith through Christ because they receive Christmas presents or a backpack and school supplies hear from the people that have been set free from drug and alcohol addiction because they found Hope in Christ through the ministry hope is alive to hear from the thousands of people in ha that came to Christ because we sponsored a 100 children 100 orphans with a Christian education food and clothing from people around the world who said yes to Jesus because of all the missionaries that we support around the world to hear from people in Indiana and Oklahoma who surrendered their life to Christ because we've stayed focused on the Great Commission we kept starting People's Church campuses building new buildings renovating buildings inviting our friends and family to church all the greatest treasur the greatest treasure in heaven is to meet every single person whose life was changed by Jesus because we invested our time our talent and our treasure into the kingdom of God matter of fact I want to share with you a life change story that came from the new campus we just launched in Edmond Oklahoma on September 10th check out this video definitely growing up was really hard my family was very distant from each other so it was hard to have a family support my grandma has always been the biggest supporter when it comes to anything related to Christ but we kind of stopped going around the time she found out she had diabetes after that I kind of lost my way whenever I got into High School school I thought my senior year would be the best year and like I always had great grades I was a smart student and I felt really prepared for that year up until my I think it was the first two weeks of my senior year and I was mentally and physically assaulted and it was by an older guy and I knew like my family would be even more hurt if they knew about it so I kept to myself and I became suicidal I became way more depressed and I just lost all my faith and everything it ruined my H Senor Year from because I gave up on everything I didn't care anymore and I was like nothing's worth this I started feeling in school I started skipping classes and so I kind of just said um over all of it and I just I just want something to make me happier make me feel better and Escape was either drinking or hanging out with friends to forget about everything going on in life and then recently I had went through a breakup but his mom was like a mom to me and she knows everything about me and my past and she told me about the edmin location opening up she convinced me and so we ended up coming to the edmin location on September 10th for the grand opening and that day I felt like God spoke to me and everything that I was going through it felt like he was listening he was there they asked for people to come down in prayer I went down and I cried I cried I bed my eyes out and I'm like I need this this is where I want to be all the time this is what I want for my life Jesus Is Telling Me Now is your time you don't need to wait there's nothing to wait on so I got baptized and as soon as I came out that water I was happy and I was like this is what I've been waiting for and ever since that day it's just like my faith has grown constantly I went to growth track and it was really good and they helped me determine like what I wanted to do within the church I am a part of the Dream Team um at the edmin location I watch the two to three year-old Jesus has been there for me constantly every day I noticed little blessings that I wouldn't notice before and I wouldn't be thankful for I'm happy that I'm alive I'm happy that I'm here thank you to everyone who invested and took time and money and everything in them to start this edmin location if it wasn't for you I probably would not have gotten back in the church and for that I am very grateful come on can we give God listen that's why we give that's why we're generous that's why we give life change more four changed lives the fourth thing I've learned is the principle of tithe and offering when I got saved at 18 I first of all I never knew what tithing was never understood it never even heard that word till I was in a church but when a pastor actually explained it to me and what it was I immediately uh started tithing to Abundant Life Church just down the street and I I never struggled with tithing I struggle with some other things but for whatever reason tithing God said it I would do it I never tried to argue or debate it was a joy it was a joy for me to give and tithe and return the 10% to the Lord after all he's done for me and this principle has shaped my life in so many ways that I want to share some verses with you from Malachi that have impacted my life on the subject of generosity more than any other verses it's Malachi CH 3: 8-1 it says will a mere mortal Rob God yet you rob me but you ask how are we robbing you in tithes and offerings see I learned that there's a difference between returning the tithe and giving offerings the tithe is giving God the first 10% of all of our income offerings are what we give over and above the tithe it says you are under a curse your whole nation because you are robbing me I learned that we miss out on God's best when we don't tithe verse 10 it says bring the whole tithe I've learned to tithe off my gross income not the net bring the whole tithe into the Storehouse that there may be food in my house I learned that my tithe is given to my local church so that there's food in God's house test me in this says the Lord Almighty and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be enough room to store it verse 11 it says I will prevent pests from devouring your crops I learned there's protection on our life on our family on our finances on our home through tithing in Jamie and I we have experienced God opening the floodgates of heaven and pouring out blessing after blessing because we've been tithers and we've given offerings and I want you to experience blessing after blessing after blessing that comes from returning the tithe and giving offerings to the Lord the fifth lesson the fifth lesson I've learned is the principle of sowing and reaping one of the greatest Revelations I've learned about generosity was the principle of sewing and reaping it's absolutely changed my life and my future let me give you the principles I've learned and then I'll share some scriptures with you here's the first principle you reap what you seow if you seow apple seed you reap apples not oranges if you seow pear seed you reap pears not apples if you sow love you reap love if you sow unforgiveness you reap unforgiveness if you sow kindness you reap kindness if you sow nastiness you will reap nastiness if you sow money you will reap money you reap what you seow number two you reap after you seow you can't reap a harvest if you don't seow seed Farmers know this they can't expect a harvest of apples if they didn't plant any seed I used to think I'll give more when I get more but I learned that I had to sew seed before I could reap a future Harvest and so Jamie and I we have been sewing offerings over and above our tithe for 19 years we're always giving because we want to have seed in the ground for future Harvest and when we give listen it leaves our hand but it doesn't leave our life number three you reap more than you seow Farmers understand this that's why they sew you sew an apple seed you get an apple tree that produces lots of apples because you reap more than you sow you can never outgive God because you reap more than you sow and then number four you reap in proportion to what you seow a farmer can't seow a little seed and expect a generous Harvest they seow little they'll reap little but if they sow a lot of seed they'll reap a generous harvest the amount of seed we seow determines the size of the Harvest look at God's word 2 Corinthians chapter 9:6 it says remember this who whoever SWS sparingly will also reap sparingly whoever SWS generously will also reap generously if you sow little you reap little if you sow generously you reap generously you reap in proportion to what you sow 2 Corinthians 9:7 it says each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful Giver whenever we get paid we should return the the tithe to God first but when we give offerings we should be led by God's spirit we should be listening and we should also pray and ask God what he would have us give and we shouldn't we should never never give under pressure or with a bad attitude we want to give generously and cheerfully whatever the Lord tells us to give now doesn't mean you may you're not going to wrestle with God I've wrestled with God many of times was that the Lord or the spaghetti I ate you know what I mean just and again I'm thankful for a Godly wife we get to talk about what we're hearing from the Lord but when we know what we're hearing from the Lord when we know God speaking we give and we give generously we don't even think about it there have been times this year spontaneously God has spoken to us to give and we've given there's been times we've been asked to give and we've prayed and we've asked from God and when we hear from God we give 2 Corinthians 9:10 it says now he who supplies seed to the S and bread for food will also Supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the Harvest of your righteousness listen God supplies so to excuse me God supplies seed to the swer not the keeper he supplies to the swer not the keeper you reap after you sow and I've learned that everything that God blesses Jamie and I with isn't for us to consume on ourselves some of what God gives us it's seed to be sown and over the years we've swn a lot into God's kingdom and time and time again God has increased our store of seed and why does God do this why does God do this so that we can continue to be generous on every occasion and reach more people with the love of God last scripture 2 Corinthians 9:11 you will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generos osity will result in Thanksgiving to God when we seow seed God continues to bring a harvest back into our lives so that we can continue to be generous if God can get it through US he'll get it to us so that we can continue to be a blessing to a hurting and broken and Lost World God blesses us not just for us He blesses us to be a blessing He blesses us to be a blessing I'm blessed to be a blessing you're blessed to be a blessing to reach more people to share Jesus with more people to help more people we are blessed to be a blessing we're blessed to be a blessing
qtoixrFHtyg,well today we are continuing our series called stay in your lane preparing for your purpose and the title of my message today is people pleasing is destroying your purpose people pleasing is destroying your purpose the movie Chariots of Fire was based on a true story of the 192 for Olympics where there there was a great Runner named Abraham his coach held him to a very high standard of discipline and Abraham had won a lot of races one day he finally lost a race he was running and as he was getting close to the Finish Line he started to look at the other Runners and he lost the race his coach told him that look cost you to race he got distracted by a person just like Abraham many people are distracted from God's purpose because they're looking at people in this series we've learned that Christ's followers get distracted from their god-given purpose by focusing on promotion power popularity Prestige prominence and we're also going to learn that they get distracted from their purpose by focusing on people focusing on people will cause you to miss your purpose I know some you thinking yeah that's right Pastor that's why I don't fool with people I don't have anything to do with people people are crazy I keep people out of my life now hold up now keeping people out of your life isn't the answer there's a delicate balance when it comes to God's purpose navigating God's purpose and people in your life because we actually need people to fulfill our purpose but on the other hand and people can distract us from our purpose and there are two extremes you have to avoid when it comes to people and God's purpose the the first extreme is I don't need people I don't care what people think I'll do whatever I want to do and who cares what people think well look what the Apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians chapter 8: 21 for we are taking pains to do what is right not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man Paul says I want to do what's right in the eyes of the Lord and also in the eyes of men see Paul cared about what other people thought about him he cared about his reputation and you should care about what other people think about you you should care about your reputation you should care what your spouse thinks of you you should care what your children or parents think of you you should care what your boss employees and co-workers think of you you should care what your teacher or coach thinks about you you should care what your friends think of you you need people to fulfill your purpose but the other extreme that you have to avoid is becoming consumed and controlled by what other people think about you when this happens you become a people pleaser rather than a god pleaser Paul also wrote in Galatians 1:10 am I now trying to win the approval of human beings or of God or am I trying to please people if I were still trying to please people I would not be a servant of Christ well which one is it Paul do I do what's right in the eyes of people or do I please God and the answer is you do both this is a tension to manage not a problem to solve we want to do what's right in the eyes of the Lord and in the eyes of people but we live to please God we want to do what's right in the eyes of the Lord and in the eyes of people but we live to please God our entire life should be all about pleasing our heavenly father and bringing him glory and yet as we study we see there are times in the Bible where when we we please God by pleasing people when I love my wife jimie like Christ loves the church with a sacrificial love it pleases God pleasing Jamie pleases God but the extreme I want to address today is how so many people are consumed consed and controlled with being a people pleaser some of you are not living out your purpose because you're distracted with being a people pleaser instead of a god pleaser and so today I want to expose some common people distractions that will keep you from your purpose and so in this series we've been studying the life of David and we're going to continue to do that and so let's look at how David dealt with these Common People distractions the first Common People distraction is this distracted by the approval of people distracted by the approval of people David had opportunity after opportunity to become controlled by needing the approval of people look at 1st Samuel 165 Samuel replied yes in peace I have come to sacrifice to the Lord Lord consecrate yourselves he was speaking to Jesse and his sons and come to the sacrifice with me then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice Samuel invited all of Jesse's Sons to the sacrifice at this sacrifice the next king of Israel was going to be selected and anointed and then look at 1st Samuel 16:11 so he asked Jesse are these all the sons you have they're still the youngest Jesse answered he is tending the sheep for some reason David's dad left him outside to take care of the sheep when David was finally invited into the house I mean he could have easily been distracted seeking after his dad's approval can you it I can imagine it being a little awkward David comes in and oh all my brothers are here Dad why did you if all your sons were invited why did you leave me out why did you have me with the the Sheep why wasn't I invited the first time that like he he could have been wondering like do you like me do you not think I have what it takes do you believe in me do you think I'm good enough I mean David could have obsessed over the fact that his dad didn't invite him into the house see some of you you're obsessing over things that really don't matter because you need the approval of people you're seeking people's approval instead of God's purpose but David lived out his purpose because he was not controlled by needing the approval of people let me give you another example David showed up to the valley of elah to bring food to his brothers who were soldiers for the Israelite Army Israelite Army was in a battle against the Philistine Army and when he arrived there was this giant named Goliath that was there and he was intimidating the entire Israelite Army the Army was fro Chen with fear and David told King Saul that he would go fight the giant look what King Saul said in 1st Samuel 17:33 you are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him you are only a young man and he has been a Warrior from his youth King Saul didn't think David could win a fight against the Giant Warrior but David didn't get distracted he didn't get insecure or consumed with seeking the approval of the king he wasn't wounded because the king didn't believe in him he didn't say Mr King so hurt that you would call me young you would point that out king sa what do I have to do for you to believe in me no no no David didn't seek validation or approval see some of you are not living out your god-given purpose because you're distracted chasing after the approval of people and the quickest way to forget what God thinks about you is to be consumed about what people think about you you need to break free from needing the approval of people and the way you break free is you have to know that your heavenly father approves of you in a few moments I'm going to show you how David knew God was with him and approved of him but first I want you to see what the Apostle Paul says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2:4 on the contrary we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel we are not trying to please people but God who tests our hearts listen if you are a Christ follower you are already approved by God so you don't have to work overtime to win the approval of people because you already have God's approval God is for you God is with you so live your life to please God make decisions that please God not people before you ask yourself if people are pleased with your decisions first ask is God pleased with my decisions is God pleased with how I'm talking is God pleased with me going to that place is God pleased if I say yes to the opportunity is God pleased with how I'm treating this person when God is pleased with you he opens the doors that no person can close come on they invite you into the house to be selected as the next king but your life is pleasing to God so God will open the right door to you for your purpose people can't stop your purpose when your life is pleasing to God they can't stop your purpose when your life is pleasing to God you're already approved by God so don't live to please people live to please God people distractions people distractions the second people distraction is distracted by what others possess distracted by what others possess David fulfilled his purpose because he didn't get distracted by the possessions and blessings of other people matter of fact after he was anointed to be the King around 15 years went by before he actually became king think about that for 15 years David watched King Saul remained in a position that he knew God had destined him for it can be very challenging when you believe God has spoken to you about a job leadership position Ministry role a standard of living and opportunity and it just seems to keep passing you by and other people are experiencing the blessings that you believe God wants you to experience listen in these moments don't get distracted by people don't become jealous because they have the job the position the opportunity the blessings don't become jealous of their gifts or their calling or their possessions David never got distracted by King Saul he actually went to the palace and serve the king and then that crazy king tried to kill David multiple times times and one night David actually found himself with the King where the King was sleeping where he could get revenge and he could kill the king and he refused to do so David didn't get even or jealous he trusted God he knew that what God had for him was for him and all he had to do was stay focused on pleasing God church if you stay focused on pleasing God people can't stop your purpose so in the waiting season don't get jealous of people don't be a hater be a celebrator don't speak negative things speak positive things guard your heart from jealousy guard your lips from negative talk don't get jealous get prepared for what God has prepared for you live a life that pleases God people distractions number three distracted by the harsh words of people another common way we get distracted is by obsessing over harsh and critical words of people listen there will always be people who say hateful things to you there will be people who are critical of you they will say mean things about you they will write about you on social media they will degrade belittle you and question your motives you don't really love God call yourself a Christian you're a hypocrite you're not qualified you have impure motives sometimes your own family will say harsh words to you you're a fool you're stupid you are dumb you're an idiot you're just like you're no good daddy or you're no good Mama David lived out his purpose and became king because he didn't get distracted by the harsh words of people let me sh show you look at 1 Samuel 17 verse 28 when elab David's older brother heard him speaking with the men he burned with anger at him and asked why have you come down here and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness I know how conceited you are and how Wicked your heart is you came down only to watch the battle wo David's older brother had a sharp tongue that would cut you you've just been keeping those few sheep was he telling da you're not important you just have that little job you ever heard someone cut you with those little comments you just got that little job got a little position you have a little money little Ministry your little old dream little blessing then David's brother tells him he's got a Wicked heart that he's conceited I mean these were no doubt harsh words for David to hear from his older brother that he respected and looked up to and then later that same day David dealt with more harsh words this time from Goliath the Philistine giant look at 1st Samuel 17: 42 through 44 he looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy glowing with health and handsome and he despised him he said to David am I a dog that you come at me with sticks and the Philistine cursed David by his Gods come here he said and I'll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals Goliath says some harsh words to David but David didn't get distracted by the harsh words of people David knew that what God said about him mattered way more than what people said about him and David he kept his focus on the Lord look at 1 Samuel 17 verse 45- 47 David said you bigheaded no he didn't he didn't say that he didn't say that oversized snaggle tooth no David didn't say that David said to the Philistine you come against me with with sword and Spear and Javelin but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty David knew he was approved by God he knew God was with him I come against you in the name of the Lord God Almighty the god of the armies of Israel whom you have defied this day the Lord will deliver you into my hands and the whole will world will know that there is a God in Israel all those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves for the battle is the Lord's and he will give all of you into our hands here's what we learned from David don't let what people say about you distract you from what God says about you let me say that again don't let what people say about you distract you from what God says about you don't treat the words of people like they're the word words of God always allow the words of God to be louder than the words of people God says you're my child you're a son and daughter of the king you're a friend of God greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you're blessed you're the head and not the tail you're chosen by God you're a royal priest you are more than a conqueror always allow the words of God to be louder than the words of people allow the words of God to be louder than the words of people people distractions people distractions number four distracted by the requests of people distracted by the requests of people if you're going to live out your god-given purpose you have to learn to say no to people let's just practice right now look at your neighbor and just tell them no look at your other neighbor just tell them no now you got to be careful on that you know what I mean you got to be careful on that those witty people ask you a question where no will go in their favor do I got to go to school tomorrow Dad no I mean yes if you say yes to every opportunity people bring your way you will miss the opportunities that God brings your way if you're always saying yes to people's plans for your life you will end up saying no to God's plan for your life David said no to people so he could say yes to God when he was getting ready to fight goli King Saul put armor on David he he wanted David to fight wearing his armor look at 1st Samuel chapter 17: 38-40 it says then Saul dressed David in his own tunic he put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head David fastened his sword over the tunic and tried walking around but he was not used to them I cannot go in these he said to Saul because I'm not used to them so he took them off then he took his staff in his hand chose five smooth stones from the stream put them in his pouch of his Shepherd's bag and with his sling in his hand approached the Philistine this is such a powerful portion of scripture David said no to the most powerful man in Israel and he wasn't being rude he wasn't disrespectful he wasn't trying to be a jerk but David knew the abilities that God had given him David knew I can't use the gifts that God has given King Saul to live out my purpose and so can you imagine everybody's watching man y'all he David he wants to go fight that philistin yeah I did oh what's he doing over there King Saul's putting his armor on him thank God CU that boy's GNA take a beating oh man put more armor on him Saul yeah hook him up hey man what David's taking off the armor he must have got he he must came to a census what grabbing he going to the stream does he need a drink oh he getting some Stones oh oh he got a slingshot oh no he didn't oh no oh no David no no no David no don't do it David said I can't go with the Kings I know it makes sense for me to go out in that armor but I got to say no to a good thing so I can say yes to a God thing I know what God has called me to I know the gifts and the abilities God told me to defeat that giant I got to get my stones and I got to get my slingshot he said no to a good thing so he could say yes to a God thing a sling and a rock and some of you have to learn to say no to people so that you can say yes to God people pleasing it will destroy your purpose you got to say no no I can't attend the event no I'm sorry I can't go to lunch or dinner no I can't let let you borrow more money you ain't pay me back the last three times no I can't commit to do that listen that's a great opportunity but no I can't no I can't come over no I can't go on a date with you no you can't have sex with me until you marry me no I can't speak at that event no I can't buy that no I I can't write that no I can't do that project no I I can't speak at that event listen y'all I have to say no way more then I say yes for me to live out my God given purpose and listen I I feel tension I have some people pleaser in me we all have some people pleaser in us I have some PE and a lot of times man these are good things that people are passionate and excited about and it's a good thing but yet it's not the God thing that God's calling me to and so more often than not I got to say no than yes matter of fact there's times I want to say yes I want to say yes to that speaking engagement or I want to say yes to that trip or that travel and yet I got to no no no I got to say no I got to say no and so I say no to tons of meetings and opportunities and speaking engagements and travel things I got to say no more than I say yes don't let pleasing people destroy your purpose learn to say no say no to what's good so that you you can say yes to what is God to what is God Galatians 1:10 am I now trying to win the approval of human beings or of God or am I trying to please people if I were still trying to please people I would not be a servant of Christ are you living to please God or people
DZS0jTnoF3U,well as we continue this series I wish I would have I have Jamie up here with me to help preach the message today because the title of today's message is I wish I would have spent more time with family I wish I would have spent more time with family Proverbs 14 1 it says the wise woman builds her house but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down we can either build our home or we can live with a lot of regret by tearing it down I want every person hearing this message today to be wise by building up your family instead of being foolish and tearing your family apart Proverbs 27 8 it says a person who Strays from home is like a bird that Strays from its nest one of the ways we can look back over our life and not have a ton of family regret is to take the proper steps that keep us from straying away from our family so many things can pull us away from family so many things are pulling for our time our attention in our affections and it's easy to stray away from your family matter of fact I'm sure you've heard the term the latter of success and that many get caught up in trying to climb the ladder of success every day their their time their attention their energy they are grinding to climb this ladder of success to be as successful and for all the accolades and so we're climbing and we're working and in our world we get celebrated by climbing the ladder of success but what can happen with the ladder of success is we spend so much time and energy climbing up this ladder and find out it Minister wrong ladder that the ladder of success is not more important than the latter to your family the latter of your marriage the latitude of relationship with God and we can get so focused on success in climbing up this ladder that we neglect our family it pulls us away from our family or our marriage the relationships that matter the most and at the end of our life man we climbed up the ladder of success to only realize man we were climbing up the wrong ladder we put priorities in the wrong area we gave way too much time to the Grind of the ladder of success instead of the latter to our family and so today we're talking about Family Matters come on y'all remember that show Family Matters come on you need some good wholesome TV get you some Steve Urkel in your life if you don't know who that is Google it but we're going to talk about four areas in family that matter foreign the first area that I would love to share with you is our time our time with our family matters so much as parents we have to plan and prioritize and protect our family's time because the fact of the matter is we will make time for the things that are important and so if our family is going to be important to us we have to make the time there's a quote that love is spelled t i m e in fact I remember Chris your mom has said that a few times she said Christopher love is spelled t-i-m-e but it's true we all would say that we love our families but unless we make the time a priority we will just naturally end up giving our time away to other things activities other people so how do we do that how do we make family time a priority we have to have a plan on paper on purpose family time has to be something that goes in our calendar just like your work schedule it has to be a priority one of my goals for this year for 2023 is to be extra intentional investing time in our daughter Cali my daughter Cali is going to be turning 12 in March and this past year she started middle school now how many of you guys remember middle school years it's cool those are not my favorite years that is it's a it's a weird time because there's just so much transition and there's so many changes happening and I knew going into this starting last summer that I had to be the loudest voice in Cali's life and so I made a plan on paper on purpose I talked with Chris and we decided that to get her ready for Middle School me and her were going to take a mommy daughter trip and the purpose of this trip was partly to have fun but the biggest purpose for me was for her to know that I wanted to be intentional about our time and for her to know that she mattered enough for us to have this trip together so we went and we hit the coasters and I'd actually love to show you a picture of my daughter there she is there's Cali she's so so awesome so we went and we went to Kings Island for a day and we went to Great Wolf Lodge and actually have a another picture check out this this uh expression an expression is worth a thousand words I just love it so much and you guys all I can tell you is aside from memories we had some of the greatest conversations because it was just her and I her brothers weren't there she didn't have Daddy pulling me away or even our dog peanut pulling me away it was just me and Cali and we were able to connect on such a deep level and what it cost me was only two days out of 365. but what it yielded me was a special bond that Cali and I started and it deepened our relationship to a whole nother level well then starting in January during 21 days of prayer fasting Cali is one of the names on my prayer list and um I was taking the time to pray for her so I even just want to touch on that like we have to take time to pray for our family so that when God puts something on our heart we're available to listen but I was praying for her uh every day during our 21 days and I felt like the holy spirit said you need to be even more intentional like this is Cali's year and so I told Cali as a Cali you and Mommy we're going to have a date every single week but in order for that to happen I had to go in my calendar right away on paper on purpose and so every Saturday Callie and I we have a standing date and it it might just be an hour we may go to Starbucks we may shop we may watch The Gilmore Girls in my room and just sit and talk but the point is that Cali knows I'm available and my hope and prayer is that when that day comes when she is having a super hard time that I am her closest friend so that when she needs someone to talk to she'll talk to me and so I think that a valuable lesson from that is we have to take that time to listen to learn from our kids you know many times as parents it's it's easy and even as spouses to with our family we feel like we know what they need and so for a lot of times it's easy for us to give advice versus what our family needs most is for us just to be quiet and listen and so the Bible actually talks about this James 1 19 it says know this my beloved Brothers let every person be quick to hear slow to speak and slow to become angry Proverbs 18 2 says a fool takes no pleasure and understanding but only in expressing his own opinion we don't want to be foolish with our family we want to take time to listen so many people will come and go in our life but family is forever so invest your best time in your family relationships amen now you might be thinking Jamie you have no idea how busy our lives are how many sports we have and things we have going on in my work schedule Dr Martin Luther King Jr once said you don't have to see the whole staircase just the first step so I'm going to give you some practical small first steps that you can take today so if you're married a small step you can take is have a weekly or a bi-weekly date night put it on your calendar at the beginning of every week Chris and I have Pillow time on Sunday night and we literally go through our phone and say when's our date night and we put it on the calendar this is so so important when Chris and I first got married though we are we're on such a tight budget we could not afford a babysitter every single week but I thank God because we were in a small group and so we were able to be creative we approached a couple or maybe you have great neighbors we have great neighbors that you could approach and just say hey would you want to do a date night Swap and that's what we did we would watch their kids so they could go on a date and then the next week they will watch our kids so we could go on a date and it was wonderful because it helped us stay in our budget can I get an amen I mean but it also helped us invest in our marriage and that's a discipline and a habit that we've kept all these years and so it's just been so invaluable another little step you can take is have a family date night a night of the week where you say Fridays is our night where we're going to be together as a family or Sunday is our night it doesn't have to be a big activity where you go out and spend money it just means nobody else is getting our family's time that's our time so plan a family date night another thing that you could do that Chris and I established pretty early on in our family schedule was having agreed upon amount of nights where you want to be together so for us we know our minimum is we need to be together two to three times a week to feel like we know what's going on in our kids lives to know what's going on in each other's lives just to have that Bond how many of you know that in your family or in your home just because you're all in the house doesn't mean you're all together right so like in our house we've got three TVs in three different rooms and there are many times where we'll all be in our own rooms on our own devices so have set nice of the week where you're doing something together whether it's watching a movie or going to someone's sporting event together or maybe it's going to church together whatever that may be set that time another small step you can take is attend church and serve together as a family you're already here why not serve together serving is so awesome because it teaches our family and our children so many valuable principles it teaches that we value putting others first it teaches people skills it teaches that we can be a leader it teaches that we can make a difference no matter what even in a small time on Sunday even in 15 minutes waving in the parking lot you can make a difference so serving is such a small practical way that you can invest in your family and then another small step is uh go to family activities together so what I mean by that is you may have one kid in choir one kid in band one kid in softball we've always made it a point that if our children have a game unless they're like on the same night then we have to divide and conquer but if they have a game or they have an activity we're all going and there are times the kids are like I have to go yes you have to go because we know that when we reinforce that we're reinforcing more than just like we're going to be together we're reinforcing the value of family and our children will take that into their marriages and deposit that into our grandchildren and so that is just so so important yeah people don't reach the end of their lives and wish they would have worked more but they do wish they would have spent more time with family you'll never look back on your life and say man I just spent too much time with my family but many people have regrets so they didn't spend enough time and so prioritize get them on your calendar and then protect it and so like Jamie said if you looked on our phones on our calendar date nights on their family date Jamie and I do two trips a year without the kids it's on the calendar we have family vacations to spend time together as a family it's on the calendar I go to we have busy lives but our kids activities are a priority and so as soon as we get the schedule the practices the games it all goes on the calendar no amount of money or success can take the place of time spent with family prioritize family time and protect family time time matters yes time does matter but another area that matters is moments moments matter and one of the easiest ways that you can invest in your family is by capitalizing on already built-in moments that you have in your day-to-day routine Deuteronomy 11 18 through 21 says fix these words of mine in your hearts and Minds tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads teach them to your children talking about them when you sit at home when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up write them on the door frames of your houses and on your Gates so that the days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the Lord swore to give your ancestors as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth I love this practical example that the Bible gives us of how simple it is teach and instill values into our children so verse 19 gives us really practical nugget examples one one example is when you lie down when you get up take 60 seconds to pray with your spouse in the morning when you wake up take two minutes to pray with your children before you kiss them good night to read a Bible verse to sing a song together these are things that are already built into our schedules and we can begin to create moments that will last for a lifetime in our families one of the Traditions I loved when our kids were younger is we had mommy and daddy time in our bedroom right before bed so it didn't matter what they were doing sometimes they were already in bed and we're like nope nope get up we're going to mommy and daddy's room and we would all get on the bed and we would take turns prank and we were all in the bed even the dog was on the bed and so it may sound like Oh what a beautiful family moment y'all there were so many times we did more corralling than praying because they were wrestling or talking you know we're like it's not play time it's pray time that was like our classic phrase but those moments were so valuable because we taught our children how to pray they saw how simple it is to pray and they knew no matter what before they went to bed we were going to pray because we valued prayer it was a built-in moment another example in that same verse when you walk along the road now obviously back back in those days in the Bible they didn't have cars but we spend so much time in our cars driving to and from activities driving to and from school you guys that is such an incredible opportunity for us to bond with our family and I would encourage you when you're in the car when you can turn the phones off turn the radio down I learn more about my kids when we are driving in the car and I'm just asking them questions how was your day what did you eat for lunch pizza oh I didn't know you liked Pizza this month you know because their kids are so fickle like it could be anything who did you talk to who did you sit with oh you didn't sit with them today how come oh we got in a fight like you just it's so amazing the things that you learn from your kids and even your spouse like I have his when he's driving he's not going to be on his cell phone very much so I have his undivided attention and it's such a great built-in moment for you to take advantage of investing in your family another example in that same verse when you sit at home meal times are such a valuable time to create a moment for your family we love to just ask the simple question when we have dinner together all right guys we're going to go around the table everybody share what was your favorite thing about today what was your least favorite thing it's such a simple question but it's so cool the things that we learn from our kids as they share the things that they learn about us as we share about our day and so it's just those simple little built-in moments that help us lead and love our family more intentionally so we have built-in moments but we can also create moments and this I love this so much because when you create moments it's something that your family bonds over and looks forward to doing together so I don't know what your family traditions are but in the Smith house we have a lot of traditions that we've created and I just love that but one of my absolute favorites um is our holiday tradition of baking Christmas Eve cinnamon rolls together and so I actually have there's Cohen that's our littlest okay you see his shirt that's evidence okay this is how messy it is okay show the next picture that's only a third of the dough y'all it goes down our entire kitchen island and you know there are many times I second guess this tradition because it's Christmas Eve we have Christmas Eve services it's Also Chris's birthday so we leave church and then we celebrate Chris's birthday and then after that it's usually about 9 or 9 30 and the kids are like are we making cinnamon rolls I'm like yes but can I just tell you in spite of the mess and how tired we are it is such a fun experience to have that moment together and it's a tradition our kids will look forward to every single year so take your holidays and find a way to create a family tradition another way is family vacations it's so easy to go on a vacation and everybody's on their devices right but when you're on family vacation be intentional have certain times where technology is off and we're going to sit together as a family we're going to go watch a movie as a family we're going to go mini golf as a family be intentional about creating moments in your family vacations and then lastly create moments with your spouse so like he said we do little getaways it doesn't have to be extravagant but twice a year we may go for one or two days the big thing is leave the kids at home thank you Jesus and we learned at such a young age that you know what they survived like whoa even when they were newborns like they ate they slept and they're still normal children and can I just tell you the way that it allowed us to bond on such a level because our kids weren't there taking our attention it was so invaluable and it has helped and strengthen our marriage so much but even more importantly our kids know that Mommy and Daddy come before them our relationship is even more valuable than their relationship with us because this has to stay strong for our whole family to stay strong yeah yeah we've learned the little things are the big things you know so taking your kids to school if you are able to do that or maybe it's before they get on the bus you know but for us we drive them to school and talk about Smith values you know serve God make the wise choice invest in others tell the truth have fun uh we'll take kids on trips sometimes I go to Oklahoma City take the kids with us and age 13. I took Jace on a trip as he was going into middle school and that transition in his life I'm the chaplain for the Ellen football team and many times I've been able to take Jace to a game and hang out on the sidelines and have moments together the marriage conference come on marriage conference is going to be a moment we believe it's going to be a moment for you and your relationship sign up get registered for it today we celebrate our kids salvation birthday so we the day that they gave their life to Jesus we have that day marked and every year we we celebrate that such a special day we want to go to the beach we go to Saint Joseph Michigan three hours away ain't nobody I can't I can't drive 10 to 12 hours to get to the beach all the time and so nor do I want to three hours just straight up north don't go right now it wouldn't be a good time but in June July or August it's a great place to get away to the beach Christmas morning we read the Christmas story before we open up gifts we sing Happy Birthday to Jesus uh when our kids were little right now we do this with Cohen but when we're putting them to bed before we pray we always sing You Are My Sunshine together and I'm sure you're thinking those are some goofy moments and traditions but that's okay there there are moments they're the Smith family moments you just want to make sure you have your own for your family because moments matter I love it because I feel like it creates such a special bond when you have those things you can look forward to together as a family planning that moment looking forward to it experiencing it the big takeaway y'all is just be intentional about those moments it doesn't have to be hard it can be small but be intentional and be consistent yep amen the third thing that matters is learning learning matters be Learners every person's basic needs are the same but the way we fulfill those needs are different from person to person personalities differ how each person in your family gives and receives love may differ how we view situations May differ and so here's some tips seek to understand before you seek to be understood ask questions and be slow to speak be a learner rather than a know-it-all study each person in your family so you can know how to love them best and how to meet their needs I'll be honest with you with with my oldest um when it comes to correction and whatnot it's very easy for me to raise my voice yell I barking I feel like I'm I'll be barking at them you know what I mean and and and Jace didn't receive that well he was like the the Charlie Brown you know the teacher won't want that whenever I'm yelling or barking it's just it's just it's not connecting and what I was doing again I was trying to teach I was trying to discipline you know all those things but the way I was going about it was not being effective at all and so I had to really like where and I'm not perfect I still have moments where I bark or I want to and I got to apologize and raise my voice but I've also learned a lot about just listening and talking and processing controlling my temper and my aim anger and my frustration and talking things out with him and the more that we've been able to do that it's been really really good for our relationship and and I remember Pastor Herbert helped me with that okay you got to listen more and so I've learned to listen and process uh and and teach and and that's helped my relationship with Jace but that's just Jace I mean Cali is different Cohen he's definitely different he's four you know and so you know relationships aren't a one-size-fits all and so you got to learn your family members helps you know how to best love them and support them learning them helps you know their strength and their weaknesses they might need you more they might need you less learning your family makes you more in tune with behaviors that might be out of the ordinary it'll alert you to situations that need more attention learning also helps you be your uh to be your best in the relationship and I got these five questions from Pastor Herbert and Tiffany I just recently asked my two oldest these questions but I think these are some great questions you could ask your kids now if your child is too probably not going to work out too well for you but if they're older here's five good questions you want to write these down real quick number one what can I do better or what can I do to better support you this year what can I do better to support you this year number two is there anything I do or say that affects you negatively number three is there something you want me to know about you that you haven't communicated to me number four is there something you would like to talk about a question a request an issue that you haven't communicated to me and then number five what is one thing you would enjoy doing together this year and I'm sure there are other questions that you could ask but I got these from Pastor Herbert and I'm like man these are good these are some good questions I'm going to ask them and I didn't ask Cohen because he's four but that's Jason Cowley and I got very different responses but that's okay these are good questions to ask their kids because asking questions it it not only increases my learning it helps me eliminate possible regret that could have come from not knowing and so learn learn your kids learn their Love Languages they change right like one of Jason's is physical touch Cali not physical touch she's like don't touch me you know what I mean Callie's not words of affirmation Kelly's she likes quality time Colin we're still trying to figure out he's four he's a depends on what mood that he is is but you you want to learn your kids yeah and going back to that that was why I planned a trip with Cali that's why we have a weekly date is because hers is quality time versus your child maybe words of encouragement and you may need to put a reminder phone once a week to lift them up so just know what Chris is sharing is so so valuable everybody is so different in how they receive love but we have to be Learners lifelong Learners Proverbs 9 9 says instruct the wise and they will be wiser still teach the righteous and they will add to their learning when it comes to our family we have to desire to add to our learning this isn't a One-Stop shop where we figure out our spouse or we figure out our kid and we're good like he said it's a lifelong process of learning where they're at based on their season a quote I love is people don't care what you know unless they know that you care so that's the goal the goal is for our family to know that we care and yeah yeah in order to care you got to learn yes to care for them the right way so number four here's the fourth thing that matters attitude attitude matters Winston Churchill said attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference so how's your attitude does your family enjoy you you can create moments prioritize time you can learn more about your family members but if you're not pleasant to be around you're vetoing all the good stuff your attitude matters your approach matters your motive matters I got this bowl of fruit here and listen I'm not faking anybody out here this is a bowl of fake fruit all right uh and and no matter what I tell you you can see this is fake and you're not going to try to eat it or tell and the Bible tells us what real fruit is okay Galatians 5 22-23 it says but the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control let me ask you what kind of fruit are you producing in your life and your relationships is it fake people can tell when you're faking kids your spouse can tell if you're faking love and page they can tell when you're faking no matter what I tell you you can tell this is fake fruit are you loving or are you disagreeable are you kind or are you critical are you joyful or are you gloomy do you display self-control or do you demand control are you patient or are you impatient are you Faithful or are you unreliable there are no perfect people and there are no perfect families but your attitude matters and your relationships are you like this bowl of fake fruit trying to look good on the outside but we know there's no fruit on the inside are you applying God's word to produce his fruit in your relationship are you planting seeds of patience are you cultivating kindness are you watering faithfulness are you pruning your attitude see your attitude has the potential to cultivate thriving relationships in your life but it also can Harvest some regret so listen I just want you to know today you have the Holy Spirit as your helper he's there for you Galatians verse 24 5 24 25 it says those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to the cross and crucified them there and then it says since we are living by the spirit let us follow the spirits leading in every part of your lives I want you to know today you are not alone you got the holy spirit that wants to help you help you lead your time the right way help you create the right moments to help your attitude get right the holy spirit is there to help you learn to produce the right fruit that God wants to have in your marriage and even with your kids and so listen you may be looking at life and you're like man I've been climbing the ladder of success every day I've been climbing it and I've been putting on my time in energy some of you may be in here today realizing oh my goodness I am on the wrong ladder here's the good news you don't have to stay on the wrong ladder the good news is you can choose to day it may take time depending on how far you climbed a bit but today you can get off the wrong ladder and you could say I'm gonna get on the right ladder I'm climbing the fed the ladder to my family to my marriage I'm given the time to climb to a better family and a better marriage I'm climbing this ladder to produce the fruit that God wants me to produce the love the patience the faithfulness the goodness the self-control is not too late we serve an amazing and redeeming God that if you ever find yourself on the wrong ladder you can get off and you can get on the right ladder for your marriage for your family for your kids for your grandkids for your great grandkids

haven't looked back ever since i love it i tell people all the time i'm like i'll be a youth pastor until i'm 90 until i'm a until i'm below the ground if that's what the lord calls me to do but man just it's awesome to be at a church so passionate about the next generation and just to serve under the leadership of pastor chris and pastor jamie i'm just so thankful that um they're not only committed but they're also convicted to reaching the next generation of leaders and world changers and so i believe uh in obeying a hundred percent of the bible especially when it says to give honor to whom honor is doing so can we just put our hands together and make some noise pastor chris and jamie smith man wonderful pastors amazing leaders and they're even better people jess and i we love you so much and just grateful for you both and how you've invested in us well today like pastor chris said it is youth take over sunday i gotta know that how many of you remember what it was like when you were a teenager though like come on this this is a diverse church that's what i love about people's church you know our skin color our ethnicity and then like our backgrounds but then it's like we got different ages in the in the room you know what i'm saying so so like if you're like me like i'm 23 so you're like oh well being a teenager wasn't that long ago for you true if you're not like me though you're like pastor andrew why are you gonna make me count to count so many years like okay i don't even know but you see what's awesome is that uh whenever i think about different demographics different people groups and age groups the word that comes to mind is actually generation uh generations a word that you'll see in the bible it's a word you may even not be surprised if you hear it often uh what i normally hear is well that was that was that generation or your generation and my generation things were this way and so really uh the the easiest way to define a generation would be a period if you will in which a a particular group of people was born and alive during that specific time and you know i kind of had a thought i was like man you know next week we're starting the throwback series which i'm really excited for by the way i hope you'll be here as we kick it off but i thought about man what if we just threw it back a little bit today because i'm like we have some different generations represented in the room and i'm like you uh honestly like each generation is unique in its own way they have different characteristics that set each other apart i'm like you really can't fully understand or grasp that though until you look back at the way like people used to dress wear their hair the slang like you know what i'm saying in fact like um my beautiful fiancee jess who is up here leading worship we're getting married in august y'all 41 days from now yes sir yes ma'am i'm excited if you can't tell but i was thinking like man you know we're over a month out i'm like i may need to change it up with my hair a little bit and so i was i felt inspired uh i went to the great theologian uh known as google these are the jokes they don't get any better so i went to google and i was like man i got to see like what was like what's a cut that that i could that i could choose from that represented each generation so what i need you all to do is help me today pick from a jedi y'all shaking your heads no at me you're supposed to shake your heads yes like all right preacher i'ma help you all right man let's look at who here who here would say uh you're from the baby boomer generation like okay i see like i see uh i see like out jen alpha raising their hands i'm like y'all don't even know what a baby boomer is that's awesome you see the baby boomer generation is often defined as people born from 1946 to 1964 which would have been during the post-world war ii era if you will some would refer to the baby boomer generation as the rock and roll generation or i thought this was awesome the first tv generation all the baby boomers like oh yeah shaking your head at me but i thought i thought a really neat hairstyle like y'all tell me if this looked good on me or not uh let's throw this first one up here from the baby boomer generation king of rocky roll look at that the pompadour look like where you at babe i think i pulled that off she's shaking her head no so she nope she gave me a thumbs down all right we're moving moving right along here the next generation uh would be generation x also known as gen x you see this generations generally defined as people born from 1965 to 1980. that's also when sylvester stallone gave us rocky balboa praise the lord jess is always reminding me she's like babe you know rocky's just a fictional character right and i'm like my buddy's real i'm like i'm like if i could be anybody i'd want to be rocky like go adrian like you know what i'm saying like i'm like i thank god for generation x gave me my hero you know what i'm saying but i thought i thought an interesting hairstyle uh let's put that one up on the screen for him how many how many of y'all know she didn't even say anything she just gave me the look like don't you dare come on mustaches and mutton chops were in back then you know what i'm saying oh what about this one uh i was gonna say that's the hippie generation but that won't speak for everybody what about this one we have any millennials in the room like okay i i hear you i hear you so also known as generation y gen y uh this generation is typically defined as people born between 1981 and 1996. uh i always joke with my dad i'm like man that's when basketball was good that's when music was good and i'm like that's when rocky 4 came out which is the best rocky if you know what i'm saying like if you don't agree we'll have an altar call at the end of service it's all right but i thought i thought a really really interesting hairstyle i want to know how many of you used to rock the michael jackson perm like y'all if i could get hair like that i'd stare at the man in the mirror too you know what i'm saying like come on or what about this who who here remembers the mullet now i got an ew from like this side of the room over here the mullet the mustache he's kind of like trying to do that elvis in the front but then like keep it long in the back like i just get that duck tail going if i don't keep it clean so i don't know if i can grow a mullet or not but you see in all seriousness like i wanted to have some fun with this today but how many of you would know and agree that the god we serve is a generational god like the bible says he's the god of abraham isaac and jacob he's a generational type of god he is a generational god and you see here at people's church we not only believe that every generation whether old or young needs to know jesus we're also committed to seeing this next generation of world changers of leaders come to know who jesus is we believe in the youth and that's why we have youth take over sunday but who exactly is this current generation of teenagers you see this generation of teenagers is what most of us would know as generation z or gen z yeah make some noise if you're gen z maybe you're like i don't know if i'm in gen z here you go some would even call you zoomers this generation is defined as people born from 1997 to 2012 which would currently be uh it from ages seven to 27. some of you are all like well pastor andrew throw up the gen z haircut y'all we didn't make our own we just copied and pasted yours like we were just like hey we're not gonna reinvent the wheel you know what i'm saying but you see i want you today to all jokes aside just for a moment i want you to lean in and listen to some statistics and some information rather that we know about gen z did you know that two out of three zoomers are currently leaving the church or have already left the church gen z is also twice as likely than any other generation to become an to become atheist this blows my mind only three percent of gen z are reading the bible and then from experiencing an unprecedented global pandemic this generation now spends at least four hours a day on their phones or devices and as a result many have labeled this generation of teenagers as screenagers a more serious note however the the unregulated and unhealthy amount of screen time this exposure has most definitely played a significant role in the mental health crisis that many in this current generation are experiencing today in fact there was also a study conducted in 2019 where researchers asked a group of teenagers about some of their life experiences within the past 90 days and here's some of the results gathered from the responses of the teenagers resolved in this particular study the study revealed that 74 of teenagers said they experienced loneliness in the last 90 days 66 percent said they experienced high anxiety in the last 90 days 60 percent said they experienced depression in the last 90 days keep in mind it's only the last 90 days the past three most recent three months not over the course of their entire life keep in mind the study was also conducted prior to the pandemic i imagine what these numbers would look like post pandemic in 2022 today another study or this study also revealed that 35 percent of teenagers in the united states reported suffering from suicidal thoughts and tendencies means there's more than one in three teenagers who said in the past 90 days they strongly thought about and considered ending their own life many people may say we have a problem or an obstacle in our way and ask what are we going to do how can we make a change you see i truly believe that there's not only an obstacle in front of us but i believe today there's an opportunity we have as a church of jesus christ as followers of jesus we have an opportunity in front of us to make a difference to make an impact on this generation what we must do is strengthen our commitment to the next generation and what i mean by that is it's not just something we just talk about it's something we have to be all about we have to put into action the change we want to see in gen z and it's our commitment that comes from our conviction and that's why at people's church we believe that gen z will be set free you see where where is it do we find and experience freedom you know when we look at scripture and we look at past experiences we know that true freedom is ultimately found only in the presence of god and that's why we have epic youth every single wednesday night here at people search it's why we do events like march madness in the spring back to school bash in the fall it's why we have an epic summer camp every single summer because we believe in the value the impact that giving students space to encounter the presence of jesus we believe in what it will accomplish we believe gen z will be set free look at what the apostle paul wrote to the church of corinth second corinthians 3 17 it says now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom i can admit today that the world does a way better job at throwing a party than the church does but can i tell you as the church we have something to offer this generation of students that the world does not that culture does not that society does not and that is the presence of jesus we have something that has changed lives for thousands and thousands of years and now is not the time to keep quiet to hold it in to ourselves but to pass it on to generation after generation so that gen z will be set free we want you to know that our youth ministry here at people's church it's not about a party it's about the presence of jesus it's not about free pizza every time there's a big event it's about the presence of jesus it's not about a promo video it's not about popularity it's all about the presence of jesus that's what people's church is all about regardless of the generation it's any and every generation it's all about the presence of god and for the next few moments today i want to share with you exactly why we're committed and convicted to creating moments for our students to experience the presence of jesus and so if you're taking notes today the title of the message is simply this the power of a moment the power of a moment whether it's a it's a moment you'd like to remember forever or one that you're like man i wish i could forget that one we all agree moments are powerful in general just in and of themselves they carry great power with them when i think about moments in my life there was a moment last year if you if you've heard me preach before you know me well i'm a die hard colts fan and so there was a game last year that took place on a saturday night i was able to go to and uh i i ended up taking my my youngest sister with me but y'all this wasn't just any colts game like we've got these rivals on the east coast i'm like trying not to say their names but for those of you who don't know i'll just say it once and get out the way the new england patriots so they came in the town we hadn't played them in a few years we hadn't beaten them and i it was like i couldn't even remember how many it was like 13 14 years i was like man i was trying to remember how old i was the last time we'd beaten our rivals and so we were on a roll they were coming into our turf and i'm like this is going to be a good game and my sister's like i'm a chiefs fan i like patrick my homes but i'll go the game with you i'm like you're not going to be chiefs fan after this game trust me so we end up going in this game and y'all talk about a football game like three quarters we shut them out we were dominating i was like let's go we're finally going to beat them and then like the colts just have this tendency when like the fourth quarter rolls around like to forget like oh we stopped 15 more minutes to play so the patriots started dominating the fourth quarter and i'm like man if we don't score here it's over we're gonna give give them the ball back it's gonna be over and so our former quarterback who i probably shouldn't name because i'll get booed off the stage but carson wentz snaps the ball and he turns around he gives it to jonathan taylor and i'm like oh man what's going to happen and i see this like incredible block and there's this big massive hole at the line of scrimmage and i'm like oh lord if he runs through that hole i'm like this ball game sure enough he turns on the jets he takes off front and every but there was nobody sitting down in that stadium y'all everybody's screaming run run run he outruns one defender two defender three defender before you know it he's walking in the end zone and i just like turn around with my sister and i go ball game like it's over everybody's training mvp mvp she goes i'm not a chiefs fan anymore i was like yeah you're not a chiefs fan anymore she starts seeing like colts and patriots fans getting into fights and i'm like man what a moment like beating your rival on your home turf after all these years i'm like that's incredible man what a moment i'll i'll never forget or there was also a moment in my life that was more near and dear to my heart a year ago in july when i i asked the most beautiful human ever uh to become my wife we went to saint george i flew her all the way out to utah tried to con talk her into marrying me it worked she said yes we got a picture up on that mountain man a moment i'll never forget like i had it all scripted everything i was going to say and then it's like in a moment you're like oh man i should have brought sermon notes just ask her to marry me because i can't remember any of it so man do you just pull the ring out pocket getting down on one knee man what an emotional powerful moment we'll hold on to forever man when we're about when we get married here in 41 days man what a moment that's going to be think about the moments in your life when when you said yes to your person when you got married or whenever you had your children think about the moment you gave your life to jesus we all have moments that carry power and significance to us in some way you see we want our students to not just have moments we want them to have moments with jesus because we know it can change everything it's in his presence where we receive his promises we believe that the presence of jesus changes everything let's look at a passage where god's promises are found in his presence it's found in acts chapter two beginning at verse number one the bible says on the day of pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place suddenly there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm and it filled the house where they were sitting then what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them and everyone present was filled with the holy spirit and began speaking in other languages as the holy spirit gave them this ability you see why are moments in the presence of god why are moments with jesus so meaningful why are they so important why do they matter it's because a moment with jesus serves like a key a custom cut key to a specific clock it's that moment with jesus that will unlock the door for you to experience more of god's presence in your life you see how many of you would agree you need more joy you need more peace you need more rest you need more comfort everything that we need is ultimately found in the presence of jesus and so today i want to talk to you today about the power of a moment the first thing i want us to realize is this number one moments will unlock more you see at this point in your life this will this may be new to some of you or this may be just an awesome reminder for you today that i hope blesses you no matter what you have seen or experienced up to this point in your life or in your relationship with jesus there is still more that god has in store for you whether you're a baby boomer whether you're gen x whether you're gen z no matter what generation you come from or you claim god has more for your life in this moment than what you have already experienced up to this point you see in the bible jesus is actually talking to his disciples about experiencing more it was before this moment in acts 2 jesus began to take time to prepare his disciples to receive the gift of the holy spirit in acts chapter 1 verse 8 jesus told them but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem and judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth what's awesome is that jesus's disciples remember up to this point they've seen him open blind eyes they've seen him open deaf ears people who couldn't walk are walking running jumping doing all these things they've seen dead people come to life and now jesus is in a position where he's about to end this earthly ministry and he tells them you haven't seen anything yet there's still so much more that i'm preparing you for to experience in your life jesus even said in john chapter 14 that there are greater things we would do in our time on this earth than he did in his earthly ministry but how is that even possible because we believe that when we receive more from jesus we can do more for jesus and peter's an example for us to look at because before the power of the holy spirit came into his life before he unlocked more y'all he couldn't he denied he knew jesus in front of the little girl like and then he has a moment with jesus that unlocks everything and the bible says he's filled with boldness he's filled with power to preach the gospel on the day of pentecost and to be an early leader or to be a leader in the early church he was more confident in his boldness and in his witness and you see we believe that jesus is wanting to do more in this generation and that's why we're believing for more because we serve a god who can do more the bible says in ephesians chapter 3 verse 20 it says this now all glory to god who is able through his mighty power at work within us to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think and when we get this it truly changes everything when we understand that in every season and every situation every circumstance god is able and that there is power that didn't come from ourselves but power that comes from god power that comes from having a relationship with jesus being filled with the holy spirit there's a power working in us to help me love people who are difficult to love to help me set a good influence on those around me to help me resist temptation that comes into my life there is the power i have access to greater than what i can accomplish on my own there's more and it all comes from being with jesus you see paul continued in his letter to the church of ephesus in chapter four he's talking about unity in the body of christ listen to what he said in verse 14. he said then we will no longer be immature like children we won't be tossed and blown away by every wind of new teaching we will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth instead we will speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more like christ who is the head of his body the church here at people's church we want you to know that we will do everything short of sin to ensure that our students will not be immature like children to ensure that our students will not be tossed around by the teachings the ideologies the philosophies of this world and our culture that our students will not be influenced by others but instead our we will raise up a generation that will speak the truth and love and that will grow to become more and more like jesus and how is that possible it comes from spending time with jesus it comes from having a moment with jesus because a moment when jesus changes everything the truth is that jesus wants to do more and that alone is why we can't afford to be satisfied or complacent with where we are in our lives and in our faith journey god wants to do more in pc kids god wants to do more in epic youth he wants to do more and our young adults here at people's church god wants to do more in you he wants to do more through you we want our kids and you to have a moment with jesus because a moment with jesus will unlock more you know here on the front row i've got uh pastor chris and jamie son jace i'm like not going to try to embarrass you bro but there was a time when we started our youth ministry where jace was just coming to wednesday nights by himself and then before i knew it jace started bringing a friend of his from uh mount vernon named liam and so liam comes and he gets to see what epic is all about and liam's like man this is pretty cool like all right i could be a part of this like there was even a moment in one of our small groups one night where liam was just able to connect with everybody in the group and share about his life and he was like man i never had a moment like that before like that was different i really like that i i feel like family like i belong here and i'm like man this is cool like jay starts bringing liam awesome and then they like double team and they're like man we got to get tony to come to epic tony right here on the front row they're like man we got to get tony to come to epic now so then tony starts coming and so like tony begins to experience what epic is about like all right this is cool like i'll go the epic every wednesday night with jace and with liam and then before i know it i'm like man there was one now there's three this is pretty cool i like what i'm seeing and then before i know it the three of them get together they're like all right we can't do this without mason so now we got to get mason coming and i'm like then all four of them walk in and i'm like hold on a second i'm like this is pretty cool y'all they go they go to summer camp man it was awesome to get to see jace's friends give their life to jesus at epic some of them even gave their life to jesus at summer camp two weeks ago they've joined our epic summer internship team on wednesday nights they're leading the way in the altar i'm like man it's moments like that that create movements because jace had a moment with jesus that led to a mo to a movement where do you see like our god's a god of movement when we see that in scripture he never stays stuck or stands still he's a god of movement and you get to see the movement in that story where it wasn't just jason anymore jace had a moment with jesus and it moved to jason liam having a moment with jesus and then tony and then mason and can i tell you that's what youth ministry is all about it's not about a 60-second highlight reel it's about of movement a move we believe that not only there's power in a moment but we also believe that moments will unlock a movement moments will unlock a movement it says in the book of acts in chapter 2 verse 41 that those who believed in what peter preached on the day of bene pentecost they were baptized and it says they added to the church that day about 3 000 people and all you talk about a church service when three thousand people come to know jesus that's incredible that's a movement and it says in verse 47 each day the lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved day after day there were moments leading to a movement a movement that's how powerful a moment in a movement is is that something that started in the early church is something we're still living in today as the church of jesus christ there's power in movements church you see we are praying and believing for a movement in our students you know i i shared those stats with you earlier today and when i look at the future man there's so much i don't know like who who here was able to predict that we have a global pandemic in 2020 if you knew why didn't you tell the rest of us like you know what i'm saying there's but there's so much i don't know but here's what i do know i know that god is still faithful god is faithful he was faithful to my great-grandparents my grandparents my parents he's been faithful to my generation and i know he'll be faithful in generations long after me that outlive me i know jesus still saves heals and delivers i know that the holy spirit still empowers people i know through jesus the church is still the hope of the world i know that this generation has been destined by god for greatness i know that our mission at people's church is still more changed lives it was 20 years ago it is today and 20 years from now generations from now it will still always be about more changed lives i shared this with all of our youth leaders at the beginning of the year but i did this study where i took within 10 to 15 minutes of our location here at people's church i took every high school every middle school within 10 to 15 minutes of where we are and i got the enrollment of each school did the math and thought like man how many students are in our backyard like how many students could we reach and the total number i ended up with was 64 000. i was like wow i was like that's incredible like how how can i put that in perspective today and so here's what i want to show you here's a picture of raymond james stadium where the tampa bay buccaneers play their home games the max capacity of that nfl stadium is guess what exactly 64 000 students and there may be some of you here like now pastor andrew like some of those come from godly homes they're they go to a good church they're involved in a youth group and i praise god for every single student that that's their testimony but i guarantee you the majority of that 64 000 broken home depressed anxious lost doesn't know who jesus is doesn't have a community doesn't have a good support system think about that 64 000 people that is our ceiling what we're capable of reaching these 64 000 students though can i tell you they don't just need another youth ministry to attend on wednesday night but what this city needs is a movement something to be a part of to call home to call family where there's moments with jesus and where there's movements where we're sharing jesus i don't know a lot but i do know this here at people's church we will raise up a youth movement that will change the world because moments start movements and we see it all throughout the book of acts at people's church i see a youth movement where students will experience the power of the holy spirit i see a youth movement that is diverse and for everyone one of my favorite verses in acts 2 17 it says in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit upon all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams means jews and gentiles red black white yellow brown men women young old rich poor i see a youth movement where scripture engagement is a priority in acts 2 42 it says that all the believers devoted themselves to the apostles teaching of the word of god i see a youth movement that will make every effort to help students know god grow in god discover their purpose and make a difference in second peter 1 12-13 it says i will always remind you of those things even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you have i think it is right to refresh your memory as i live in the tent of this body because i know that i will soon put as aside as our lord jesus christ has made it clear to me he says and i will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things see church family gen z will be set free but to see it happen it's going to start with you and it's going to start with me you know my prayers are youth pastors not that students who grow up and graduate from our youth ministry will remember every single sermon i preached we'll remember all the fun games we played my number one prayer is that when they graduate and move on into life they'll reflect on the moments they had with each other the moments they had with jesus that led to the movement they were a part of something they experienced so real they can take with them from generations to come you see today no matter what generation you would claim we all have a part in seeing gen z be set free it may look different for all of us but no matter where you are today what you feel called to i'd like to ask you to do three things one would you pray for this generation would you spend time praying interceding for them the pressures they face are real their struggles their issues are real they need to know that there's people in their corner cheering them on praying for them believing in them number two would you prioritize the church with your children with your grandchildren and with your students success starts on sundays with youth ministry we could say it starts on wednesdays too but i'm thankful today all these students you see serving most of them they serve every single sunday they're a part of god's house they're connected may make god's house a priority for your students they'll never be the same you won't regret it and lastly number three would you participate in reaching the next generation [Music] you know we all have a role to play i'm thankful for every youth leader we have on our team and maybe you're hearing you're like well pastor andrew i'm definitely not called to be a youth leader maybe but you are called to serve and today i just want to take a moment from my heart to challenge and encourage those of you if you haven't completed growth track or maybe you completed growth track but you would say i'm not on a dream team or i don't serve consistently on sundays and when we talk about god has more for your life than what you've experienced man that's what that looks like for you being a part of a community and a team making a difference in god's house every weekend so if that's you today and you know your next step to experiencing more of jesus is to get involved with growth tracker to get on a dream team would you text pcgt9400 and when you do that you'll get a link just click on the link and fill out the form and we'll get you registered you can even let us know as you fill that out you can let us know hey i've already completed growth track i don't need to go through it again i just need to get on a team and man we're excited to help you get connected to take your next step moving forward people's church moments have power [Music] moments create movements moments with jesus change everything and the most important thing i can do today is give you all an opportunity to have a moment with jesus
wLh57_VzPLI,well today we are continuing our series called bounce back good advice for a bad day and we all have bad days no matter how much you love god pray come to church read your bible you will have bad days bad days are a part of living in this fallen world maybe you had a bad day this week maybe today has started off as a bad day maybe yesterday when you woke up and you saw snow on the ground you thought this is gonna be a bad day or but we all have bad days and no matter how bad of a day you've had if you learn how to respond correctly you can bounce back but if you respond incorrectly a bad day can turn into a bad week a bad month a bad year a bad decade or even a bad life and we've been learning some good advice from what jesus said on his worst day ever in about a 12-hour period jesus was beaten whipped falsely accused spit on humiliated rejected had a crown of thorns put on his head and he was nailed to the cross and on his worst day ever we see how jesus responded on the cross with seven insightful statements and from these statements we've learned that on our worst day we need to forgive we need to remember our witness and on our worst day we need to love anyways and so today we're going to look at statement number four where jesus says why have you forsaken me look at matthew chapter 27 verse 45-46 it says from noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land somehow god made it dark in the middle of the day for three hours it became a dark day it was a dark moment for jesus about three in the afternoon jesus cried out in a loud voice elie ellie lama sabachthani which means my god my god why have you forsaken me the greek word for cried out means to scream jesus literally screamed out at the top of his lungs ellie elements of bhaktani which means my god my god why have you forsaken me forsaken there in the text means deserted rejected let go abandoned jesus was on the cross and he had a deep feelings of being abandoned on his worst day on earth he was abandoned by everybody he was first abandoned by judas then abandoned by the crowd then he was abandoned by his disciples he was abandoned on the cross carrying our sin he was abandoned by his heavenly father it hurts deeply when you're abandoned many of you know this first hand maybe a spouse left you and ripped your heart out maybe one or both of your parents walked out the door and walked out of your life when you were a child or teenager maybe you've been abandoned by a boyfriend a girlfriend or a friendship a close friend maybe a boss or a co-worker they left you high and dry and it deeply hurts but it's even worse when you feel abandoned by god god where are you god i need you i don't feel you i don't see you working at all god are you with me have you left me and this is how some of you are feeling today where is god i remember when i was 18 years old my senior year in high school was at our high school's basketball game we were in the playoffs and i remember when one of my classmates john stewart died on the court i remember being in that crowd not not a christian but at that moment when we realized something was wrong begging and pleading and crying for god to say him that that god do not let him die and then later that night we found out that john was dead and i remember they had grief counselors and pastors at the school and i remember telling a pastor there's absolutely no way you can convince me there's a god why would god let this happen where i was begging pleading i can remember when jamie and i were trying to get pregnant with our third child remember a year going by and after a year just why god what's what's going on what and then a year and a half and then two years and then we get pregnant only to then miscarry the baby and i remember being like why god why is this happening well like i remember thinking thoughts like that did is it because of my past sin like do you not want us to have a child like we prayed and we've been praying and we felt peace and that you wanted us to have a third like what is going on god where are you why is this happening feeling like god has abandoned us can be a bad day that can be hard to bounce back from and throughout my years of ministry it's broken my heart to see people who have felt abandoned by god choose to bounce away from god instead of bouncing towards god they ran from god they turned their back on god they rejected god some even cursed god they quit going to church quit praying quit giving quit reading their bible they quit serving they quit going to a small group they quit on god see our human nature is to reject those that reject us to abandon those who abandon us and i want us to learn how to respond to feelings of being abandoned by god so our bad days don't turn into worse days i want to give you three right responses when you feel abandoned by god three right responses when you feel abandoned by god number one is this remind yourself that god loves you and is with you god loves you and is with you if you're a christ follower even on your worst day god loves you and is with you god has not left you on your worst day god is with you hebrews 13 5 it says keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have because god has said never everybody say never never will i leave you never will i forsake you let me give you three takeaways number one is this because god is with you you're not alone look at matthew 28 20. it says in teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you jesus said and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age no matter how far god may feel from you right now if you are a christ follower i can promise you god is with you i know you feel isolated but god is with you that you feel abandoned but god's with you you feel lonely but god's with you i know it's hard right now but god is with you god sees you and he is with you you are not alone here's the second thing because god is with you take your hard questions to god because god is with you take your hard questions to god look what hebrews chapter 4 verse 15 and 16 says it says this high priest of ours understands our weaknesses for he faced all of the same testings we do yet he did not sin so let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious god there we will receive his mercy and we will find grace to help us when we need it most go to the throne of grace boldly go to god with bold prayers bold questions and your bold concerns god isn't intimidated or scared of your boldness take your hard questions to god god why did this happen why did they die why did they leave why the sickness why the abuse why the pain why didn't you intervene why didn't you heal why didn't you stop it from happening listen you can be bold with god he says come boldly come boldly to his throne and when we go boldly to god's throne scripture says you can receive mercy grace and help when you need it the most take your bold questions to god so he can help you after we had the miscarriage we had lots of but why god why is this happening what is going on where are you and there were many tears and there was anger and there was frustration but i cannot tell you every time we ask god those hard questions and we're crying out to him each time i can remember god's peace i can a matter of fact i can remember so vividly god's saying chris will you trust me and will you trust my timing i see you i love you i can just remember those times so vividly of just asking god why and just feeling his comfort in his love and his peace listen god isn't intimidated by your bold questions bring them to him ask him and i'm telling you he'll he may not give you the answer that you want but he'll give you the the comfort the mercy and grace that you need number three the third takeaway is because god is with you this season is a part of your story not the entire story it's a part of your story but it's not the entire story jesus was abandoned on the cross but that was part of the story not the entire story see on the third day jesus rose from the grave his pain had a purpose it was part of the story not the entire story first corinthians 13 12 it says for now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face now i know in part then i shall know fully easy even as i have been fully known see right now in your bad day you just know in part we can't see the whole story that god is writing with our life in in our situation but understand that what you're going through it is a chapter in your book not the whole book all you can see right now is the chapter that you're living in but it's only a chapter and don't let the chapter of your life define the rest of your life god is with you your bat it is just a chapter and god works all things together for the good of those who love him and follow him in your bad days after the miscarriage we had questions there was anger but we did not let a chapter define our life we chose that we're going to keep trusting and we're going to keep trying and i think it took at least another year but then we finally were pregnant again with our child cohen who's three years old and god helped us and it was with us listen don't let your chapter define the rest of your life here's the second thing the second thing i want to help you today with when you feel abandoned by god number two is turn why god into what god turn why god into what god whenever you're facing a difficult chapter in your life and it feels like god isn't with you turn your why questions into what questions ask god what do you want to teach me what do you want to teach me hebrews 5 8 it says even though jesus was god's son he learned obedience from the things he suffered see jesus screamed why have you forsaken me because god isn't afraid of our why god questions but jesus stayed on the cross because of the what jesus knew the what was to save humanity the what is important if we don't end up turning our why god questions into what god questions we start questioning god's character his love and his faithfulness when we're having a bad day we got to shift from why god to what god and the what god will help you bounce towards god instead of away god what are you trying to teach me what are you trying to show me what god will help you bounce back from a bad day secondly ask god what do you want to do in me what do you want to do in me the apostle paul in one of his writings described a a thorn in his flesh and three different times paul asked god to remove it but god said no and paul could have easily felt abandoned rejected like what do you mean no but look what paul says in second corinthians chapter 12 verse 7. paul says or because of these surpassingly great revelations therefore in order to keep me from becoming conceited i was given a thorn in my flesh a messenger of satan to tort to torment me paul asked why god three times but instead of asking 20 times and starting to question god's character he discovered the what paul said the what was god wanted to keep him from becoming conceited paul realized that what felt like rejection from god was really god trying to do something inside of him see bad days can reveal what's inside of us god's silence his no or when we feel abandoned can reveal our weaknesses our inner sin or where our faith is weak ask god god what do you want to do in me i don't want to miss what you're trying to do in me god deal with my pride my my insecurities my blind spots my lust my my greed my lying my my hatefulness my bitterness my anger issues deal with them we gotta shift from asking why god to what god what do you want to do in me because on most bad days we really find out what's on the inside some things get on earth that god says hey i wanna i wanna touch that i wanna heal that i wanna restore that i wanna i wanna work in that no no no paul i i can't because i don't want you to become conceited number three ask god what do you want to do through me what do you want to do through me on your bad day instead of continuing to ask why god ask god what do you want to do through me what god threw through what god did through jesus on his worst day has changed us forever there was purpose in the pain on his worst day ever jesus paid the sin debt of all humanity on that cross hebrews 12 2 says fixing our eyes on jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith for the joy set before him he endured the cross scorning it shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god jesus endured the pain of the cross because he was focused on the what god wanted to do through him he was focused on the joy of seeing lost humanity reconciled to god what god did through paul's thorn in his flesh was to use him to write about two-thirds of the new testament to plant churches to see many saved and healed and set free and to raise up great leaders like timothy see when god is silent when you feel abandoned or rejected remember he doesn't forsake us so ask what god what do you want to do through me see there's always purpose in your pain god oftentimes will use our greatest pain as a launching pad for our greatest calling your greatest ministry can come out of your greatest misery i am passionate about outreach because god used it to save me when i was hurting and when i was lost i told you at 18 years old after my classmate had passed away i was at that point i was attending a church but i was convinced you can't tell me that there is a god and after that i started drinking and getting drunk more after that i even started to do drugs and i i but but all those things just kept me more empty but at that time i was still attending a youth group not because i wanted jesus the youth group was fun they had basketball and i had to endure a service to hoop and hang out and be with my friends and so i was going for the fun but eventually god got a hold of my heart eventually i got saved and that's why i'm so passionate i'm so passionate about easter and we're doing egg extravaganza for the extravaganza for the kids and it's a great opportunity to invite people that are hurting and broken and lost some people that some bad days have pulled them away from god or kept them away from god and so man i would encourage you i i got my cards because i'm i'm ready to start inviting my my daughter kelly's starting softball right now and so we're going to start inviting some of the parents as we hang out at the practices together when it gets warm my street my neighborhood folks like to just the parents and kids are always hanging out and so we're gonna go and hang out with them and just look for opportunities to say hey i'd love to invite you to my church on easter sunday i'm gonna buy some folks their coffee at starbucks and invite them to church on on easter sunday and so there's just so many different ways you could buy someone's gas or groceries and hand them an easter invite card or your kids athletic teams or your neighbors i got family and friends i i have people that i've been inviting for years and i'm i'm believing this easter is finally going to be the easter that they can come but i'm still going to send them an invite and invite them listen god will use your pain for his purpose he'll use your greatest misery my friend dying it was it was it was heartbreaking for our school for his family i can't imagine but god ended up using that because even though i said i'll never believe in god some things happened in my life where all of a sudden i was crying out to god and god changed my life forever and he'll change the life of others as well and so when you feel like you've been abandoned by god turn your why god into a what god and then number three number three what do you do when you feel like the right response when you feel like god has abandoned you is when you can't trace god's hand trust god's heart when you can't trace god's hand trust god's heart when you're going through a bad day it's so important to remember that jesus is not powerless he's the same jesus who walked on water he's the same jesus who fed thousands with a few fish and loaves he's the same jesus that raised lazarus from the dead he had the pa he he had the power to come off the cross but he chose to trust his heavenly father and die on the cross luke 23 verse 46 jesus called out in a loud voice father into your hands i commit my spirit and when he had said this he breathed his last on his worst day jesus chose to stay on the cross and die because he trusted his heavenly father's plan he turned up his trust instead of turning down his trust i don't like this but i trust you it's not easy but i trust you it's painful but i trust you they hurt me but i trust you when people feel abandoned or rejected their first response is often to lose trust in god where are you god why is this happening but don't let bad days cause you to turn down your trust on your worst day turn up your trust in god it's hard but i trust you with my life i'm having some bad days but i still trust your promises on your bad days turn up your trust in the promises of god look at second corinthians chapter 1 verse 20. it says for no matter how many promises god has made they are yes in christ and so through him the amen is spoken by us to the glory of god we turn up our trust by saying amen to god's promises amen means so be it it means so be it it's easy to say amen on our good days when things are going good but we turn up our trust when we say amen on the bad days so i want to encourage you to turn up your trust in god on your bad days to say amen to his promises that's what jesus did on the cross and that's what you and i need to do on our bad days trust in god's promises and say amen promises like hebrews 13 5 never will i leave you never will i forsake you amen god you're with me promises like romans 8 28 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him and who have been called according to his purposes amen god you're taking all the bad and you're working it for your good jeremiah 29 11 for i know the plans i have for you says the lord they are plans for good and not for disaster to give you a future and a hope amen god i'm having a bad day but you still have a plan even though there's pain ephesians 3 20 now to him who is able to do exceedingly and abundantly all above that we ask or think according to the power that works in us amen god you're going to do more than i can ask or think first peter 5 10 and after you have suffered for a little while the god of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself restore you secure you strengthen you and establish you amen god you're using this bad day to restore strengthen and establish philippians 4 19 it says that my god will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in christ jesus amen god even with these crazy gas prices and inflation i trust in you that you're going to meet all my needs according to your riches not my riches romans 8 32 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things amen god you're going to give me everything i need to fulfill my purpose on earth in lamentations 3 22-23 because of the lord's great love we are not consumed for his compassions never fail they are new every morning great is your faithfulness amen god to the fact that your character has not changed on my bad days on my worst days you're still faithful you're still compassionate and i trust you even when i don't understand i trust you even when it's painful i trust you even when it's confusing i trust you even on my worst day i trust you i trust you god i'm not turning down my trust on my bad day i'm turning up my trust in you
GyMhxAHjurE,well today like I said we're continuing with the eighth week of our series called reintroducing the Holy Spirit and the title of a message that I would like to preach to you today is called you injured the Holy Spirit you injured the Holy Spirit uh I know I don't look like it because I'm five foot nothing and probably a hundred pounds uh soaking wet I haven't been on the scale in a while pray for me but like believe it or not your boy used to be a middle school high school athlete what was always great was you know though the one time I actually had a severe injury I tore my ACL my junior year of high school in a basketball game and I'm like in the hospital and so like the nurses there they're asking like you know what what were you doing what did you do and you're like ah I tore it uh in a game and they're like oh they're not immediately thinking I'm a basketball player they're like oh what do you do do you wrestle do you soccer and I'm like no I'm a basketball player because you look at a guy who's like I don't know six two or taller and you're like he's a basketball player or he's a football player and then I like weasel in there at like probably five foot seven at the time and like oh you're a basketball player what did you get hurt on the bench and I'm like no I was in the game believe it or not but like what I learned in through playing sports is like injuries are not fun and how many y'all know there's a difference between an athlete playing hurt and playing injured like there's going to be a certain generation in a room that knows what I'm talking about like being hurt means you go tonight you go to bed that night feeling okay and you wake up the next morning and things just hurt for no reason whatsoever right but then an injury is like it's not just feeling hurt in your body like there is a body part there is something in your body that is not functioning the way that God created it to and a side effect of that is you're experiencing pain and you're experiencing hurt we would all agree today nobody likes dealing with her with pain or with injuries and if you do man we're going to give an altar call just for you today because I've never met anybody in my life who enjoys being injured but you see a lot of times it's it's no fun to experience being injured yourself but I think one of the most devastating things I've experienced in my life is when I've unintentionally or even at times intentionally hurt or injured people close to me that I love spiritually emotionally and relationally you see I often think about uh you know my my wife Jessica we just celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this month yeah praise God for that come on we made it through one year we still love each other she hasn't gotten rid of me yet I told her girl you get rid of me I'm just gonna go with you you know what I'm saying but uh now don't please don't clap with this next part but like I've learned that there are moments Even in our short time being married plenty of opportunities provided for me to fall short to fail and to miss the mark and all the husbands didn't say Amen like they just sat there in silence right uh but there have been moments where I've intentionally or unintentionally out of emotion out of anger out of immaturity and ignorance where I have injured or hurt my wife emotionally and relationally because of what I've said because of something I believe something I thought or something that I did and the consequences you experience of injuring somebody you love aren't fun you know it puts distance between you and that person they pull away and they don't want to be around you you know I can make my way wife if I'm not careful if I'm not intentional I can make her feel like she's losing her life or she's losing in our marriage you see I absolutely hate it when I hurt people that I love the most but just like we can injure or grieve a relationship with someone that we love we can actually do the same thing with the Holy Spirit the Bible calls it grieving the holy spirit in week one of our series we learn that the Holy Spirit he is God he's part of the godhead he is part of the Trinity that means him being God he has emotions we're all humans we all have emotions we're created in the image of God he is an emotional God and that means because he is a person he has emotions that we can hurt him we can cause him grief we can injure him and Pastor Chris talked about why we aren't growing in the fruit of the spirit in our lives last week and the second reason I want to talk to you about today why we aren't growing in the fruit of the spirit is that some of our lives were not experiencing this growth because we keep injuring the Holy Spirit over and over and over again Paul puts it this way in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30. he says and do not grieve the holy spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption I love the way that the message translation puts this one verse in particular it says don't grieve God do not break his heart his holy spirit moving and breathing in you is the most intimate part of your life making you fit for himself do not take such a gift for granted you know that that Greek word for grieve and the language lupeo it actually carries various meanings depending on how you would use that word and one of the ways it's used its meaning the word grief that actually means to injure to wound or to cause pain you see scripture shows us that we can cause the Holy Spirit deep pain disappointment and great sorrow in fact some of you here today you have put distance between you and the Holy Spirit and your intimacy with the Holy Spirit has been affected May what am I talking about what does that look like some of you you struggle to hear the voice of God speaking to you like he used to or maybe you're struggling to find Divine direction or God's will for your life in a particular situation maybe you feel like you're in this fog and you're not seeing things clearly you're not seeing the way that that God sees things or maybe you would say Pastor Andrew I've not felt God's presence strongly move move in my life for quite some time now maybe you have more confusion more questions than you do Clarity and understanding maybe you feel like you're going backwards in your walk with God as opposed to taking steps forward and moving closer towards him maybe you're wondering today Pastor Andrew why do I feel like this is what I'm experiencing in my life for some of you it's because you're grieving the Holy Spirit and you're injuring your relationship with him today I want to look at Ephesians chapter 4. and show you Paul specifically talks about this area of who the holy spirit is in his role in our lives how he operates and how he works this idea of grieving the Holy Spirit how we do that and what how we should respond the other way and so let me give you four ways that we injure the Holy Spirit one of the ways we do that is with an unstable mind we injure the holy spirit with an unstable mind there are three signs of an unstable mind and the first sign is a transient mind a transient mind Paul says in Ephesians 4 17 so I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do in the futility of their thinking you see that Greek word futility has the same meaning as a transient mind and what we mean by a transient mind is it's that a person who is thinking in every different direction possible they're thinking is scattered and all over the place in fact scripture talks about this mindset and this way of thinking in James chapter 1 verse 8 he wrote that such a person with a transient mind that they're double-minded they're unstable in all that they do I like the way that the New Living Translation puts this he says their loyalty is divided between God and the world and they are unstable and everything they do you see people who are double-minded and unstable in their thinking it's because they have a transient mind you see in their minds they can love God but then turn around and do a 180 and start loving the world but then the cycle continues they go back to loving God like they once did before but then before you know it they make a wrong decision they make a wrong turn and they end up loving the world again it's this constant back and forth of loving God and then loving the things of the world I want you to imagine my wife Jessica what I've learned in uh almost three years of dating we were engaged for one year now we've been married for one year is that she loves words of affirmation that is like her top number one love language it's one of my higher ones as well so I work really hard to be super intentional with my words we say I love you every morning before we start a day we say I love you every night before we go to bed and we mean it too it's not cliche when going through the motions and you know what would what do you think would happen if three or four times a day I would say girl I love you baby I'm so madly in love with you but then I would turn around and I would say girl I can't stand you right now I hate your guts I despise you you are good for nothing you know what happens to me like Pastor Andrew you've been married for a year so I'm gonna tell you what's going to happen you ain't gonna be married much longer that's very true and some of you all like bro that don't make sense to do that like why would you do that and yet that's what so many of us are doing with the Holy Spirit and we don't even realize it it's one moment we're standing God I'm so in love with you Holy Spirit I want more of you but then we turn around and we start to pursue what the world has to offer these these worldly elements that are trying to influence and overtake our relationship with the Lord you see there are people who do this because they have a transient mind the second sign of an unstable mind is a darkened mind Paul said in Ephesians 4 18 they are darkened and they're understanding I believe that one of the devil's top priorities for your life is to darken your mind he doesn't want you to think clearly he doesn't want you to see things the way that God sees them he wants you to live in confusion and be surrounded by a cloud of Darkness to overtake your thoughts you know that's exactly what he does to people who don't know God and yet he will love to do the same thing to your mind as well Paul talks about this in second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 4 he said that the God of this age the enemy he has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the Gospel that displays the glory of Christ who is the image of God you see the devil he blinds the minds of unbelievers and as followers of Jesus he is still actively working and trying to do the same exact thing with us you see the third sign of an unstable mind is a carnal mind say carnal mind Paul talks about this in verse 18 He says they're darkened in their understanding they're separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them so scripture tells us they carnal minded what's it do it separates us from the life of God you see people who have a carnal mind what we mean by that is that they are only living to please themselves It's All About Me Myself and I baby that is what a person with a carnal mind believes in how they live their life it's all about pleasing their fleshly desires what they crave what they desire for themselves as opposed to what God desires for them Paul says in Philippians chapter 3 verses 18 and 19 for as I have often told you before and I'll tell you again even with tears many live as enemies of the Cross of Christ their Destiny is destruction their God is their stomach another translation says their God is their appetite it's all about what satisfies them in the moment what makes them feel good he says their glory is in their shame their mind is set on Earthly things people search a carnal mind it's set on Earthly things and Earthly desires only thinking about the pleasures of Earth the people who live for here and now they are putting the wrong things in their mind they watch and they listen to the wrong things they're meditating on the wrong things they're reading the wrong things they're feeding their flesh instead of feeding their Spirit man and feeding their faith today some of you you have a you have a transient mind a darkened mind a communal mind and it's that unstable mind that is injuring your relationship with the Holy Spirit but you see another way we injured the Holy Spirit not just with an unstable mind is also with a hard heart we injure the Holy Spirit by having a hard heart instead of a soft heart Paul says in Ephesians 4 18 they are darkened in their understanding they're separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts see many people have an unstable mind to begin with because they already have a hardened heart they've developed this this hardened heart over time I mean maybe there's some of you today used to have a heart that was tender towards God and the things of God but since then your heart has grown cold and it's hardened you used to hate sin or whenever you did Sin when you made a mistake or fell short you immediately felt convicted and you felt the urge the need to repent to turn away from sin and to turn to God or maybe you used to be bothered by watching certain things listening to certain things or reading certain things but now because your heart has grown hard sin evil and wickedness don't even bother you anymore why is that it's because you've developed a hardened heart and it's a hard heart that also leads to a sensual heart instead of a sensitive heart in verse 19 of chapter 4 in Ephesians Paul says having lost all sensitivity they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity you see whenever you allow your heart to grow harder and harder you begin to view sin treat sin respond to sin as an unbeliever somebody who would not know God personally through having a relationship with his son Jesus you've lost your sensitivity maybe you stop listening or sensing the holy spirit's conviction you live for what pleases your flesh and what makes you feel good maybe you're indulging in impurity and evil maybe you're making poor decision after a poor decision mistake after a mistaken none of it seems to be bothering you why it's because you have a sensual heart and a sensual heart leads to having a greedy heart instead of A Generous Heart a greedy heart instead of his Generous Heart Paul continues in verse 19 he says having lost all sensitivity they've given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity and they are full of greed listen greed is always self-focused instead of God focused we preach about generosity because generosity is all about Jesus but greed is all about self it's focused on what makes me happy it doesn't care about if the decision or the lifestyle hurts your family if it hurts your spouse if it hurts your kids if it hurts your church or if it even hurts or it injures your relationship with God and with the Holy Spirit it doesn't care how your decisions impact those around you and your future you just do whatever makes you happy and you're investing your time your talent and your treasure into Earthly things instead of Eternal things you see church family it's having a hard heart sensual heart and a greedy heart that will always injure the Holy Spirit we injure the holy spirit with an unstable mind we injure the holy spirit with a hard heart but we also injure the holy spirit with unwholesome speech in Ephesians chapter 4 Paul spends a great deal talking about how we can specifically injure the Holy Spirit through the way we conduct our speech we injure the holy spirit with deceptive and dishonest speech in Ephesians 4 25 Paul wrote therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor for we are all members of one body you see when you live a life of deceptive and dishonest speech when you're lying to people when you're deceiving other people you'll find yourself distant from the Holy Spirit you won't feel his presence you won't sense his conviction you won't hear his voice trying to speak with to you you see we also enter the holy spirit with derogatory degrading and damaging speech Paul talks about this in verse 29 he wrote do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen you see we injure the holy spirit with our speech when we tear other people down with our words instead of building them up we injure our relationship with the Holy Spirit by degrading people by firing verbal missiles at our kids at our spouse at our family and our friends you see spouting off whatever comes to mind if I Pastor if I think it I'm just going to speak it you're going to injure the Holy Spirit your relationship with God and you're going to hurt your testimony your relationship with other people if you don't guard your tongue and be intentional about how you conduct your speech because here's what I've learned is that you can't be right with God and not be right with other people Jesus said it does you no good for you to say you love God but then you turn around and hate your brother or your sister no we have to love God and love people especially through the way we speak you see we don't just injure the holy spirit with an unstable mind with a hard heart or with unwholesome speech but we also injure the holy spirit with ungodly actions we injure the holy spirit with ungodly actions what are ungodly actions you see ungodly actions or actions that happen because of our out of control anger Paul reminds us of this truth in verse 26 it's a short phrase yet it's so so powerful he says in your anger do not sin you see being angry itself is not a sin we talked about how God is the god of emotions we see all throughout scripture that God had to process the the emotion of anger yet what God never allowed was for his anger to be out of control his anger never took control of him we see Jesus model that beautifully for us in scripture you see we allow our anger to cause us to sin when we give anger the driver's seat in our life you see Paul taught us that when we sin because of our anger we injure our relationship with the Holy Spirit we also injure our relationship with the Holy Spirit by actions that give the devil a foothold Paul talks about this in verse 27 he says and do not give the devil a foothold that word foothold is actually a military term and it's referring to giving the enemy access giving the enemy control Paul is saying don't do things that's going to allow the enemy to get his foot in the door and get direct access to the important areas to all the areas of your life and your relationship with God listen because of the way you're responding to people when you're angry because you fly off the handle and don't think twice about it because you're violent because you're explosive because everyone is scared of you because you look one way in public but behind closed doors you're a monster to the people who live with you and do life with you you may not realize that you are giving the enemy a foothold in your life and you are injuring your relationship with the Holy spirit listen to me Church you're opening up the door for demonic activity in your life every time you lose control of your anger and you're injuring your relationship with the Holy Spirit as a result see we injure the holy spirit with actions that involve stealing and laziness as well in verse 28 Paul says anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer but must work doing something useful with their own hands that they may have something to share with those in need stealing and laziness it Grieves they both grieve the Holy Spirit you know today in today's culture stealing comes in various forms maybe like most of you in my mind when I think about stealing I think about taking somebody's device somebody's money somebody's property right but what I've also learned is that there are different ways other than possessions tangible physical possessions that you can steal from people I learned this when I used to work for my dad through college before I jumped into full-time Ministry and this was a huge wake-up call for me did you know that you were actually stealing by being on your phone during work hours at your place of employment you're getting paid to do a job and you're saying that you represent I keep seeing like people look over at the people are sitting next to and I'm like oh Lord Jesus Holy Spirit have your way um I'm speaking from personal experience okay if you feel convicted that's the Holy Spirit but it was a huge wake-up call for me because I don't just represent this company I represent Jesus Paul writes in Colossians what Colossians whatever it is you do you work at it with all your my all your strength all your ability not like you're doing it for a human boss or a human employer but you're doing it for the Lord Jesus that's why God the Holy Spirit takes stealing and laziness so seriously you see you're supposed to be accomplishing your job but instead you're goofing off on your phone you're playing Candy Crush you're scrolling y'all I don't scroll through Tick Tock and all my students tell me I'm old because I do Instagram reels instead so pray for me they're they're coming for the youth pastor card you see but as Christ followers we don't steal we're not lazy we're not entitled we work hard because we're not working just for a paycheck we're not just working for a promotion we're working for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords we represent a kingdom that is not of this earth that is not of this world we represent the kingdom of heaven and we work you see whenever a Christ follower steals or is lazy they injure the Holy Spirit so maybe you're here today and you say well Pastor Andrew I've injured my relationship with the Holy Spirit what am I supposed to do my friend the answer is found in scripture you see I want to give you two ways to repair your injured relationship with the Holy Spirit or maybe you're here today and you say Pastor Andrew I don't think my relationship with the holy spirit's injured but it still needs to be improved it still needs to be better it still needs to be stronger I need to be more connected I need to be more intimate with the Holy Spirit here's two things you can do number one is this put off your old self put off your old self in Ephesians 4 22 Paul says you were taught with regard to your former way of life he's talking about this is before you said yes to Jesus this was before you came to know God your former way of life you were taught to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its sinful deceitful desires Paul is saying that the way you repair your relationship with the Holy Spirit you have to put off your old self what does that mean the way you used to think before you came to Christ the way you used to talk the way you used to behave the people you use to hang out with the way you used to act you have to put all of that off and in verse 25 he says therefore each of you you have to put off falsehood speak truthfully to your neighbor we are all members of one body he's saying put off the unstable thinking put off the hard heart put off the unwholesome speech put off the ungodly actions and in verse 31 he says you have to get rid of all bitterness get rid of all rage get rid of the anger get rid of the brawling the slander and every form of malice and hatred I love how the message translation says it says make a clean break with all the cutting the backbiting and the profane talk you see listen church family repentance is necessary for repairing repentance is necessary for repairing some of you aren't preparing your relationship with the holy spirit because you think feeling badly and saying your sorry is good enough and can I tell you this today I'm not preaching this at you or coming from a place of judgment or condemnation it's because I know what it's like to grieve the Holy Spirit and to cause pain and to put strain and tension in that relationship and I've had to learn it's not empty words it's not a feeling a shallow feeling it's not an empty apology that moves the heart of God and repairs a relationship with the holy spirit it's repentance it's turning away from a sinful habit it's turning away from a sinful lifestyle and turning back to God turning back to his word turning back to his way of living life listen if your sorrow does not lead to repentance number one it's not true repentance and number two you will never repair your relationship the Holy Spirit I think about my wife Jessica in our first year of marriage if there was things I was always committing to but dropping the ball on and falling short and I just said sorry I'll be better next time oh that's my bad that's all me I dropped the ball on that one but there wasn't a change in my behavior if there wasn't a change in how I lived my life can I tell you that relationship would never grow my marriage would never improve it would never be repaired in fact it would go backwards it would be damaged there would be strife and that's what we often do with the Holy Spirit we'll never have an intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit apart from repentance a second thing we need to do we not only put off the old self but number two we also need to be made new we need to be made new listen it's the holy spirit's job to make you new when you repent you're asking the Holy Spirit to make you new that's the job of the Holy Spirit he makes us new he does force what we can't do ourselves but you see the key to repairing your relationship with the Holy Spirit is to ask him to make you new but then you have to take steps to become new you're like hold up Pastor time out you just said the holy spirit's job is to make menus so what are you saying I need to be made new like I have a part in this yes you see the holy spirit's part and your part have to come together and work together Paul talks about this in verses 23 and 24 he says to be made new in that attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like God and true righteousness and holiness you're made new by asking the Holy Spirit to transform you into a new creation to give you a new heart to give you a new mind to give you a new mouth and new actions but then you have to be the one to put on the new self that's been invade available in Christ Jesus you have to change what you're watching what you're listening to and what you're reading and you've got to put on the new self you have to change the friends that you're hanging out with every week and the people you're surrounding yourself with and put on the new you have to end that toxic relationship and change what you're doing on Friday nights and Saturday nights and put on the new you have to change your speech and stop the lying stop the gossiping and the backbiting and put on the new you gotta change your phone computer habits with the websites you're going to what you're doing on social media and you have to put on the new you got to get in a small group find a spiritual Mentor get accountability in your life and put on the new yet to be in God's word find a bible plan spend time praying be in God's house every time the doors are open why because you're putting on the new he says you have to put off the old self take it off and put on what God has for you his Spirit wants a deep personal and intimate relationship with you he wants to transform your mind he wants to transform your heart he wants to transform your speech and your behavior but you have to put on the new self today maybe you need to repair or improve your relationship with [Music] we have to put off the old self and we have to ask the Holy Spirit to make us new to transform us from the inside out but then we have to be made new by putting on the new self
mGdAtGHMDiM,well today we are uh continuing our series on angels and demons and the title of my message today is what the devil doesn't want you to know you know social media can be a great tool to share Jesus but one of the frustrating things about social media are all the Impostors and scammers I'll never forget when I got a message from Pastor Herbert our founding Pastor he's my spiritual father he knows where I live he's got my number and I get this message from him and it starts off child of God you are highly favor and uplifted as I was meditating the Holy Spirit Led me through your profile I'm like h up and ministered a vision to me around you I'm like Pastor you got my number so immediately I knew what was happening here and it's crazy when I clicked on that page it had pictures of him his family wife kids impostor so I reported it right away I let our staff know our that's over our social media and I've had people at our campus say hey Pastor Chris Pastor Herbert sent me a message on social media it was is this him and I'm like I am so sorry that is not him matter of fact one of our our church members they got tricked look look look at this next one this they they sent this to us he's saying God wants you to sew a seed and this and that and they they started texting back I don't have any funds available but I'll try and see what I can do and they fell they they were tricked by these scammers and these Impostors first off Pastor Herbert is never going to message you or ask you for anything on social media secondly if you know Pastor Herbert he don't be talking like the way the but these people they are smooth and tricky and they're trying to figure out how to deceive and how to scam and those scammers they are so smooth at what they do they keep coming up with different schemes to outt people and the Devil is a lot like those scammers in 2 Corinthians 2:1 it says in order that Satan might not outwit us for we are not unaware of his schemes the devil has so many SCH schemes and he is outwitting so many people and so today I want to expose 10 things the devil doesn't want you to know 10 things the devil doesn't want you to know number one is this he's trying to deceive you one of the major reasons Satan outwits so many people is because his mode of operation is deception he is the deceiver of all deceivers look at Revelation 12:9 this great Dragon the ancient serpent called the devil or Satan the one deceiving the whole world was thrown down to earth with all his angels Satan is such a master deceiver that he has Desi devised a plan to deceive the whole world he's deceiving North America South America Europe Africa Antarctica Asia and Australia he is phenomenal at what he does you know I think about the movie Finding Nemo and I like the movie Finding Nemo but I'm like you know what I don't think fish can talk to each other because if they did can you imagine little George fish and Wendy fish they're swimming talking how are you doing today you know they're just swimming and all of a sudden Georgie sees a snack I'm doing good kind of hungry oh and then all of a sudden Georgie just disappear I mean Wendy's like and then next day Wendy's hanging out with little Freddy to fish Freddy got hungry ooh a little worm he goes on you figure at some point Wendy and other fish start talking to each other like hey y'all y'all need to be careful out in these streets don't just be biting on anything cuz you could be gone fish they're they're they're so dumb they they because they're so easily deceived they they didn't recognize the the hook on that bait and next thing you know they're at your fish fry and Satan is always putting his bait on the hook and deceiving the world and US humans can be pretty dumb just like those fish and the devil hooks us with deception he's trying to deceive you into believing that he doesn't exist Charles bodair said the devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist the devil's greatest deception is to get you in the entire world to believe that he doesn't exist there's no devil or evil spirits behind all the darkness you see in the world a barn a research study said that in America only 26% of Christians said that they strongly believe that Satan exists the devil is phenomenal at deceiving people and when the devil PE when the devil gets people to believe that he isn't real he he catches them with his hook and he starts leading their life he starts controlling their life and when the devil is controlling your life you are in a world of trouble he he's trying to deceive you into believing right is wrong and wrong is Right 2 Corinthians chapter 11:1 14- 15 it said and no wonder for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of Light it is not surprising then if his servants also masquerade as Servants of righteousness their end will be what their actions deserve the the devil and his demonic angels they do their best to present themselves as Servants of righteousness they're they're evil but they do their best to appear holy they do their best to make evil look good and good look evil they're very deceptive acts 13: 8-10 it says but elim as the sorcerer for that is what his name means opposed them and tried to turn the proc counsel from the faith then Saul who was called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit looked straight at elus and said you are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right you are full of all kinds of Deceit and trickery will you never stop perverting the right ways of the lord the devil is full of all kinds of Deceit and trickery he perverts the right ways of the Lord marriage is stupid why would you get married just live together marriage between just one man and one woman silly that's so old school if kids want to be a dog or cat just let them be whatever they want to be and the devil uses so much trickery to pervert the right ways of the Lord he will deceive you with his bait and hook your life and control you thirdly he's trying to deceive you to turn away from Jesus 2 Corinthians 11:3 it says but I afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the Serpent's cunning your minds May somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ Satan is using so much deception to lead you away from a sincere and devoted relationship with Jesus Christ he wants you to be lukewarm he wants you to go back to your old lifestyle serving God is it relevant it's boring why would you be devoted to God in the Bible That's Just silly live your life however you want to it's your life and the devil is reaching into his bag he's pulling out every trick and deception to push you away from Jesus 1 Timothy 4:1 it says the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons don't let these deceiving Spirits cause you to abandon your faith and devotion to God number two the second thing he don't want you to know is he's constantly lying to you John 8:44 it says you belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out your father's desires he was a murderer from the beginning not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him when he lies he speaks his native language for he is a liar and the father of Lies whenever the devil speaks to you it's always a lie you have to understand this about your spiritual enemy he's always lying I I remember growing up and hearing some people say that rat poison it is 90% good corn and 10% poison what makes the devil so effective is that he'll take 90% of the truth and then he mixes it with just a little lie to make it sound good he is so good at lying and twisting the truth just a little bit so that he can hook you with his bait he he he lies to you about God the devil said to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3 did God say and he smoothly Twisted what God said he always twists and manipulates What God Says so that he can lie to you about God he wants to distort your image of God God isn't good God doesn't have your best interest in mind God doesn't love you God isn't for you and the devil will lie to you because he wants you to stop believing in God to stop trusting in God and to stop having faith in God secondly he lies to you about without you Adam and Eve were living in Perfection but the devil lied to them and made them feel like they weren't enough that they were missing something they needed to disobey God because they didn't have enough the devil is always trying to make you feel like you're not enough or you don't have enough he's always lying to you about you thirdly he lies to you about people Adam and Eve listened to the devil they disobey God and then they had a distorted view of each other they became ashamed and they started hiding their bodies from one another with fig leaves and they started blaming each other and I know the devil was loving this and just feeding them lies about each other the devil is always lying to you about people so that he can damage your relationships he wants you to live with fractured and broken relationships he wants you to live with a distorted view of people you can't ever trust people all people are bad everybody has impure motives nobody loves you all pastors are frauds all of your friends are trying to sabotage your life don't let the devil lie to you and hook you and cause you to damage cause damage in all your relationships number three he's he's trying to make you a liar Satan wants you to believe the lies and he also wants you to tell lies acts 5:3 then Peter said ananas how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you receive for the land Satan's agenda is to get you to tell his lies for him he want you to be a part of building his kingdom by telling lies and some of you didn't realize the devil has you hooked you're always telling lies you lie to your family your friends your boss your co-workers you've fallen for the bait of Satan and and he is controlling your life number four he's trying to devour you 1 Peter 5'8 be alert and of sober mind your enemy the devil prows around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour Satan wants to devour your life he wants to chew you up and spit you out he wants to devour your life John 10:10 it says the thief comes only to steal kill and destroy the devil literally wants to destroy your physical mental and emotional health your career your money and your relationships let me give you an example of how the devil is trying to devour and destroy your life Luke 13:11 it says and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for 18 years she was bent over and could not straighten up at all Luke 13:16 then should should not this woman a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has kept Bound for 18 long years be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her Satan kept this woman Bound for 18 years see the devil wants to keep every area of your life bound he's trying to devour and Destroy every area of your life your physical health your mental and emotional health your relationships your finances your career next week next week we're going to talk about demon possession and Demon oppression the following week we're going to we're going to wrap up the series talking about spiritual warfare listen you are going to learn how to live in Freedom and have victory over the devil make sure you're here for the final two weeks number five number five things he doesn't want you to know he's trying to fill you full of fear the devil's mode of operation is fear 2 Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind if God hasn't given people a spirit of fear then who's doing it it's the devil he wants to hook you with fear he wants your life to be led by fear he wants you making all of your decisions based on fear he knows fear will keep you from living by faith Hebrews 11:6 says without faith you can't please God and he knows if he can get fear to control your life then you won't live by faith and please God number six he's constantly tempting you to sin the devil is called the temp tempter look at Matthew 4:3 the tempter came to him and said if you are the Son of God tell these stones to become bread all the devil does is tempt you day after day after day he tempts you 1 Thessalonians 3:5 for this reason when I could stand it no longer I sent to find out about your faith I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain the the Devil is a tempter that's who he is 1 Corinthians 7:5 do not deprive each other except perhaps by Mutual consent for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control he's trying to tempt married couples but not just married couples he's tempting singles youth kids adults senior citizens he's tempting the world number seven he's attacking you with false accusations Revelation 12:10 it says then I heard a loud voice in heaven say now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah for the accuser of our brothers and sisters who accuses them before our God day and night has been hurled down Satan loves to accuse you he loves to accuse you and remind you of your sins some of you you've been believing the accusation of Satan it's all your fault you caused all these problems you caused all these family issues you're not a good enough parent you can't overcome your past you're a failure look at you you keep on sinning you lose sir you idiot why do you even come to church somebody today listen you need to stop listening to the devil's accusations you got to silence the voice of the Devil with the word of God if you're a Christian your past is Forgiven don't listen to The Devil's lies number eight he's persecuting Christians Revelation 2:10 it sayso not be afraid of what you're about to suffer I tell you the devil will put some of you in prison to test you and you will suffer persecution for 10 days be faithful even to the point of death and I will give you life as your Victor's Crown the devil is always persecuting Christians 2 Timothy 3:12 it says in fact everyone who wants to live a Godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted if you want to live a Godly life you will be persecuted Pastor I came to church to be encouraged can you be more positive okay I'm positive that if you live a Godly life you will be persecuted that's what the devil does when you live a Godly life just count on the devil bringing up some kind of persecution your way number nine what he doesn't want you to know is that he's trying to stop the work of God 1 Thessalonians chap 2: 18 it says for we wanted to come to you certainly I Paul did again and again but Satan blocked our way Paul was trying to visit the church in thessalonica but somehow Satan kept blocking him what I've learned about the devil is he's always trying to block the work of God there are some things that are out of your control that the devil is blocking you can't do anything about it but some of you are letting the devil block things that are within your control let me give you a couple of examples first he's been some of you he's been blocking you from getting water baptized listen don't let the devil keep blocking you from obeying God don't let him keep feeding you excuses of why you can't get water baptized next Sunday we're having bapti baptisms next Sunday get water baptized sign up today go out in the lobby take the next step in your faith Journey Don't Let The Devil block you from the work God wants to do in your life secondly he's been blocking you from lifting your hands and worshiping God don't lift your hands you'll look goofy silly you can worship God however you want to and the Devil he's blocking you he is blocking you from what you were created to do and that's to worship God with all your heart with all your soul with your mind to lift your voice and to sing and to lift holy hands and to clap and praise him thirdly he's been blocking you from attending church you're too busy to come to church every week you can sleep in on Sundays you can do your grocery shopping then you don't really need to attend church to keep strong a strong faith in God listen we're doing the four-week challenge because God told Christians not to forsake gathering together you need to be in church for your life to flourish Don't Let The Devil Keep blocking you from a attending church consistently next he's trying to block you from going to growth track and serving on the Dream Team the devil does not want you to discover your purpose and make a difference no he doesn't he wants to block you from building God's church and building God's kingdom he wants to block you from God using you to see Chang lives and lastly he's trying to block you from going to a small group and having Christian friends if people really knew you they wouldn't like you you don't want people to know all your business you don't really need friends you're an introvert when we start our false small group semester on September 8th don't let the devil block you from finding a small group to 10 the devil is always trying to block the work of God in your life and then lastly number 10 he's trying to keep non-believers from becoming Believers Satan fights very hard to keep people far from God from coming close to God look at 2 Corinthians 4:4 it says the God of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the Gospel that displays the glory of Christ who is the image of God some of you aren't serving God because the devil has blinded your mind you hear about Jesus and the Forgiveness of your sins and it sounds like a fairy tale to you it sounds like foolishness you think this God thing is a hoax and I want you to understand there is a real devil who's blinding your mind and today I want to pray for the blinders to be removed from your heart and from your mind and for you to accept Jesus's love his grace and his forgiveness
81MSn6XwHkA,well today we are continuing our series called throwback we had a little it was a little bit of throwback worship for me from the inside out that was like my youth ministry days i remember that song and uh we opened up with you are good and that song had a hymn in there and so every single week we're going to be throwing back with different john genres of worship music and one sunday we're going to have a choir up on the stage and so you don't want to miss one week and then we're just looking at some old testament heroes and we're going to be learning from their lives on lessons that are going to build up our faith and so today we're going to look at jonah i've titled this message life lessons from jonah if you aren't familiar with jonah and his story let me give you some insight into his story god told jonah to go preach to the people of nineveh jonah was one of god's prophets and you figure shouldn't be a big deal jonah go and and share god's word but what you may not know is that uh the people of nineveh they were not very nice people they were known for their reign of violence terror torture they killed conquered peoples and then they would pridefully carry home parts of their enemy leaders bodies as souvenirs of war they were cruel they were wicked the people of nineveh they were the worst of the worst and so when god came to jonah and said i want you to preach to nineveh jonah said no thank you and he actually did the exact opposite matter of fact he went in the opposite direction of where god told him to go if jonah had a theme song for his life it would have been i did it my way by frank sinatra that was showing us that okay i heard you god but i'm gonna do it my way i remember when i was young my mom and dad always told me not to play outside with no shoes on like if you can go play outside you need to put your shoes on and there was one day i decided i'm gonna do it my way and so i snuck outside with no shoes on and i'm running through the streets and i'm running on the sidewalks and uh one of the on one of our sidewalks two of the squares uh were actually gravel for well i can't remember what happened it had gotten damaged and so the sidewalk was graveling so i'm running down the sidewalk as fast as i can and i'm like oh this is why they want me to wear shoes because it would hurt my feet if i run on this gravel so i'm running i'm like it's okay i'm just going to run into the grass and so i'm running as fast as i can and i jump into the grass and there was broken glass i jumped i mean sliced my foot bleeding i fall on the ground i'm screaming mom dad my neighbor she comes running out of her household in front of her house there's blood glass sticking out of my foot she just picks me up and she's just god bless this mom she carried me all the way i'm like ah i'm gonna die uh i've been i'm just crying and screaming and god bless my parents because they could have been like we told you so but but i'm crying they got me in they're pulling the glass out of my foot and washing my foot and i'm bleeding everywhere and that day i decided to do it my way and i paid a price i decided to do it my way and my foot got sliced open bleeding crying and screaming and there are many peoples whose theme song is i did it my way doesn't matter what god's word says they are doing it their way and their way has caused pain just like it did me their way has caused fractured relationships financial hardship family drama sabotaging their career it's caused some to be depressed lonely addicted and distant from god because living our way never turns out the right way when our way doesn't align with god's way it will never work in our favor and today some of you you have a plan for your life your theme song right now would be i'm doing it my way i did it my way you're going your own way you're doing relationships your way money your way career your way friendships your way life your way and for some of you it has left you in a bad way or it is leading you down towards a bad way and this is what happened to joseph he or excuse me jonah he decided to do it his way and it caused some problems and pain so we got to learn some lessons from jonah today we got to learn some life lessons and i want to share with you three lessons when you do things your way three lessons when you do things your way the first lesson i want you to learn is this our way is never better than god's way our way is never better than god's way let's look at jonah chapter one verse one through four it said the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amitai go to the great city of nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me but jonah ran away from the lord and headed for tarshish he went to joppa where he found a ship bound for that port after paying the fare he went aboard and sailed for tarshish to flee from the lord then the lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up see jonah doesn't want to do what god is asking him to do jonah believes his way is better than god's way and so jonah ended up going over 2 000 miles in the opposite direction of nineveh to tarshish he went over 2 000 miles away from the direction that god told him to go see going our way instead of god's way always gets us further from god and his plan and one of the most deceiving things about going our way is that we have a tendency to think that our way is the right way that we're all tempted to think we know the best way let me give you a couple reasons why we are tempted to go our way instead of god's way one is we don't like god's way there are times that god's way will require us to do things that we don't want to do god asked jonah to preach to the city of nineveh jonah didn't want to preach to the city of nineveh i mean god always asked his prophets to speak to his own people the israelites but this was different because the people in nineveh they were assyrians they were not israelites they were the enemies of israel and god's like i want you to do this and john's like i don't want to do this guy's like no i want you to preach to this city so they could have the opportunity to repent i was like i don't want them to repent i don't want them to have the opportunity general he did not like god's way so he went his own way let me ask you are you running away from god's way because you don't like it you don't like god's way of forgiving i'm not trying to turn the other cheek i want to punch them in the cheek i don't like god's way maybe you don't like god's way of waiting to have sex before marriage i mean but we're in love god knows our heart i mean we're gonna we're gonna end up married anyways you don't like god's way of tithing i'm not giving my money to the church i'm giving my money to me the mall the movies we don't like god's way of controlling our anger we just pop off go off on people that's just the way that's my personality that's the way i was made this is who i am we don't like god's way of honoring our father and mother my parents said my parents weren't god honored they don't know what they talking about over there they're always getting on my nerves and honoring them or you may be thinking man they were horrible they don't deserve to be honored listen i could go on and on we don't like god's way of loving our enemies like god's way of keeping no record of wrongs we don't like god's way so for some we choose our way because we don't like god's way another way that we'd be tempted to go our own our own way is we we choose our way over god's way because we don't think there will be any problems going our own way jonah was escaping god told him to go this way he's like i'm going this way so he thinks he's ducking out on god he's walking got about 2 000 miles all right i'm good oh there's a ship so he goes and gets on the ship jonah's getting on the cruise y'all he's like where the hammock at found the hammock sitting on the hammock sun is shining the waves are just kind of taking them nice and to see see i knew what i was doing and then all of a sudden it gets dark man who's getting in the way of my tan you know what i mean you need to move and he opens his eyes there's nobody there storm clouds are coming in oh all of a sudden the boat is like whoa everybody's freaking out waves are crashing and coming there's this massive storm everybody's freaking out what's going on jonah's like i might have an idea they're like what do you mean you might have an idea i kind of went my own way instead of obeying god's way oh my so they throw his butt right off the boat here you go god you can have them spare us next thing you know jonah's in the water you know he's trying to swim in the waves and he's got seaweed wrapped around his head and he's going under and then he gets swallowed by a fish it's quite the day for jonah that day in that madness he was there for three days three nights see we can fall into the same trap because at times there is an immediate trouble when we choose our own way but the reality is they will come at some point proverbs 14 verse 12 and 3 it says there's a way of life that looks harmless enough look again it leads straight to hell sure those appear to be having a good time but all that laughter will end in heartbreak sir jonah thought he was good and got on the boat but things changed rather rapidly see going our way instead of god's way always leads us into trouble oftentimes it can lead to pain and heartbreak i remember jamie and i went we were young and married and we knew what god's word said about dead and not living a life in debt and being a slave to the lender but things were getting tight but man we still got to have that vacation you know what i mean it's a little swiping here and you know and oh man we got to get some new furniture or something you know another little swipe here and i ought to be all right you know we go and so we're just swiping here swiping there oh we're good we're having fun we we think we're okay like like we know god's word but oh i'm sure it'll be all right and next thing you know after a few years we're looking we have eighteen thousand dollars worth of credit card debt on a credit card with 20 interest oh all want fun anymore we're not laughing anymore i'm like oh we can't i mean i remember i mean i started i said maybe we gotta change some things what do you mean like our vacations yeah like it's probably the last good meal we're gonna have that on we better bring some bread and jelly to the park and pray for some nice weather because uh oh man it was painful it was tough and we thank god he helped us get out of that debt but we went our own way and it got us in a whole lot of trouble our way is never better than god's way it's never better than god's way let me give you a second lesson we can learn from jonah number two god is always making a way to bring us back to his way even when we choose to go our own way even when we choose to ignore god reject god tell god to talk to the hand god is always making a way for us to get back to his way that's what jonah did jonah gave god the hand and next thing you know he's about to be drowning he's he's probably taking his last breath and look at jonah 1 17. it says now the lord provided a huge fish to swallow jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights see even when we run from god rebel against god go our own way god still pursues us jonah went his own way he said god talk to the hand i'm not going your way i'm going minor way and he finds himself thrown into the sea he's taking his last breath he's under the water he's thinking this is it waves are crashing and all of a sudden god sent a fish to save him see as we run from god god is still always chasing us god doesn't quit on you he hasn't given up on you you may run 2 000 miles from him gotten yourself in a terrible situation a terrible mess and he is there to save you he will send a fish to spare your life and to bring you back to him you ever seen in movies where there's like a high speed chase and somebody's trying to lose the other person you know what i mean they're crossing over mediums and making them hard turns and flipping around and driving they're doing all we can to to to lose the person or or how about top gun i don't know if y'all saw that movie oh man you know they're flying on that jet they're trying to the enemy's behind and they're they're trying to get away and lose them and they can't shake them and then all of a sudden tom cruise like i don't know what he did he threw on like air brakes the flame the plane threw around got behind the dude he's like where'd he go he lost him here's the awesome thing about god you can never lose god you can try all the crazy turns you can do a flip you can hide you can take five lefts and three rights and do whatever you can to try to get away from him you can't lose god he's in hot pursuit of you you keep running but he keeps chasing he keeps sending a storm to bring you back he'll send a fish to bring you back you can't outrun god's grace you can't shake his mercy you can't hide from his grace you can't escape god's compassion towards you you can try to run two thousand miles away and he's still gonna pursue you with a storm or with a fish because he loves you and he wants to get you back on the right path he wants to get you on his way not your way we lived in oklahoma city for about seven years i was youth pastor at people's church in oklahoma city jamie led worship and in oklahoma city the city is very different you know we have 465 that goes all the way around indianapolis and you got kind of 60 you know 69 and 74 and 70 and 65 that cut through the city but in in oklahoma city they don't have 465 but they have a turnpike that it's a toll road that you pay to go on and that can get you oftentimes really quickly to wherever you're trying to get in oklahoma city matter of fact the toll road also will take you from oklahoma city uh to tulsa so it's nice nice road tall you pay to get on it and get off and um and so often times when we got there we were we were using the tow rule we were like oh man save like five or ten minutes on your drive and when we were newly moving there you ever been at a spot where all of a sudden exits come in and you have to make a decision and your brain just like disappears you know what i mean you like forget where you are you're like hold up am i supposed to go east west and my north right now my south and you waited so long you don't have a lot of time to make that decision and so you just guess well i guessed and i guessed wrong and here's the thing on the turnpike when you guess wrong when it's at the the place where you're deciding at the intersection where you're deciding whether you're going to go further into oklahoma city we're in the path towards tulsa if you guess wrong it'll cost you because if you pick the tulsa way which i did i picked the wrong way first of all you don't get a you know how most interstates there's like an exit coming like another mile or two you know what i mean another three no no no when you take this one there's not another exit for like 15 20 miles not only that when you get off you have to pay the toll and then when you get back on you had to pay the torah god the wrong way wasted all my time and i had to pay a price here's the beautiful thing about god god always has an exit ramp for you you don't got to wait 10 miles 15 miles or 20 miles and you don't have to pay the price because he has already paid it he's paid the price that at any moment at any time if you were going the wrong way you can get off the exit and get on the right way god always provides an exit off the wrong way he provides the turning lane there's always a u-turn available so that you can start going god's way second corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 it says for god made christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sin so that we could be made right with god through christ god sent jesus and he paid the price so that we could get on the right way he made a way so that at any time any day you can get on god's way come on somebody today needs to get off my way avenue and start going god's way so jonah went the wrong way chose to go the wrong way god chased him with a storm god chased him with the fish and made a way for jonah to start going god's way and i want to help you see i want to give you the third lesson today the third lesson we can learn from jonah's life is that god's way is a grace and mercy way it's a grace and mercy way if you read the story i would encourage you to read just the book of jonah but if you read through it you'll see that when he's in the belly of the fish that he repents and he asks god for forgiveness and in this story we see god's grace god didn't say i'm sorry it's too late i'm gonna make you go preach to somebody worse than nineveh gonna walk away from me trying to go to tarshish who do you think you are jonah you have to walk on some hot coals to even get there no that's not what god did god said i've still chosen you i still called you and he gave jonah a second chance jonah who knew god's way it was clear to him he couldn't be like oh did oh you say nineveh i did i thought you meant nike town and i'm just sorry i just got that kind of no no he knew he knew he knew he knew he went his own way and god didn't give jonah what he deserved he showed jonah mercy and grace he gave jonah another chance to do what god called him to do the first time that's the kind of god we serve listen you can exit off my way avenue and start going god's way and you can still do what god told you to do and what god has called you to do it's not too late to do whatever god told you to do he's a god of grace see we live in a world that won't always show you grace we live in a world where if you go the wrong way family may disown you you go the wrong way a boss may fire you you go the wrong way a teacher may flunk you you go the wrong way there's no second chance there's no mercy no grace thankfully that is not god's way we learn from jonah that god's way is a way of grace and mercy that god still had a plan and a purpose and jonah could turn things around it reminds me of hebrews 4 16 it says let us then approach god's throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need you need to know that if you will turn from your way and approach god's throne god will always show you grace and mercy in your time of need god will always love you i remember at 18 years old i remember in high school i was living my way i did not believe in god could care less about god i was living a life of sin i was hurting i was broken and i remember attending church for a whole year and i remember at times just sensing god and sensing his presence but i just continued to reject it and rebel against it i remember i wouldn't receive i would shake it off pride would hold me back but i thank god that he never stopped pursuing he never stopped chasing that his presence was always there so that when i finally surrendered he didn't beat me he didn't whoop me and he no no he picked me up he lifted me out of my mess he cleaned me up and says i've called you and i got a plan for you and you've done some messed up stuff but i got some awesome stuff for you to do i got a plan i got a purpose we serve a god that makes a way he's a god of grace and mercy he does not give up he's not there to just put you in the corner no no no he'll lift you up lift you on your feet come on if god's been good to you would you stand right now would you stand and would you lift your hands to heaven maybe some of you in here you need god to be good to you you've been going your own way and you say god i'm done god i'm done i'm done going my way i'm done going my way i'm going your way come on as we sing this song
CYLnKEpnCq8,today I'm excited uh to preach and for the next few minutes I want to speak to you directly uh on a subject I've entitled the secret to spiritual warfare the secret to spiritual warfare what many people unfortunately don't realize is that there is a real spiritual battle taking place every minute of every day and this spiritual battle is actually currently in influencing and impacting the physical world around us many people are unaware of the spiritual war While others may be afraid or intimidated by the reality or just the thought that there is this unseen battle that has taken place now for thousands of years Between Heaven and Hell and I think it would be easy for many of us if not all of us to be disinterested or to ignore what's happened or even to try as hard as we possibly can to avoid being involved but the reality is friend whether you realize it or not you are already in this fight when I think that it would be easy for us to be passive for us to remain neutral the truth is we are in a battle you see you can't you cannot choose whether or not you're in the fight but you can choose whether or not you win the fight you're already in it you might as well choose to win it and I want to draw your attention to Ephesians chapter 6 beginning at verse number 10 this morning in his letter to the church at Ephesus the Apostle Paul taught Believers how to fight and how to win spiritual battles and I believe the Holy Spirit today through God's word is going to teach and Empower us to win spiritual battles in our lives as well Ephesians chapter 6 beginning at verse number 10 Paul writes a final word word be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil there are too many people especially followers of Jesus who are living defeated lives and not experiencing Victory and freedom in specific areas of their lives and they've been struggling it's because the devil is trying to destroy them he's just trying to have his way with their finances with their marriages with their family with their jobs with their health some of you here today you've been struggling this year in some ways you can't even explain how or why you've been struggling spiritually relationally mentally physically and emotionally and it's because you're in a spiritual battle one year in high school I'll never forget there was a young lady in our class for her birthday party she inv invited a group of us to go play paintball together and so we uh I had done paintballing a couple times when I was in high school uh was nervous at first just CU I didn't know what to expect and then did it the first time I was like I'm sold anytime you want to play paintball I'm there so we went for her party to go paintballing had a great time and had all sorts of fun it was competitive but in a good way up to a certain point so what ends up happening is the uh the manager the guy who was in charge of our group making sure we stayed safe we had fun uh that we followed all the rules right uh he decided to change it up when we got to the final game we had played for a couple hours and we get to the final game and he says all right this final game it's going to be between the guys and the girls the Battle of the Sexes if you know what I'm saying now here's a couple things I'm going to give you that's significant you got to remember this when I get to the end of the story two things the first thing is one of the rules he gave us like at the very beginning before we ever played the first game was whenever you come within six feet of your opponent and you have the advantage they're vulnerable they're at they're basically like at your advantage at your mercy right it's an automatic surrender so what they have to do when you get within six feet of them is they have to get down and raise their their paintball gun over their head okay so just remember that six feet okay second thing guys versus girls there were 15 girls there at that party and like five of us guys okay so even as a teenager I was like wait a minute I was like I know what this guy's trying to do but y'all we did not care if we were a bunch of high school guys testosterone right we're like we don't care if they got 15500 and there's five of us negative five of us we about to go out we GNA win this thing right so the the we get to the final game and unfortunately we just got annihilated we got destroyed like I can't even explain what happened y'all there were like teenage girls crawling out of manhole covers bunkers like like they were just like appearing in midair and so like there's five of us four of us get out and we've got one player left and they still got like 12 it was ridiculous or one player left it was my buddy Sean okay I'm going to tell you something about sea here in a minute but when you got out they made you like go stand on top of this hill that was like out of bounds but it was cool because you could look across the whole field and see everything that was going on so our buddy Shawn he's like he is fighting for his life M he's out there like double 07 you know what I'm saying he's like bobbing weaving dodging he thinks he's taking ground he homeboy literally thinks he about to take down this whole entire team and win it for our team but he could not see what we saw and what we saw was an army of about 12 teenage females not only circling him but closing in on him and we're like we're so far away he can't hear us we're yelling Sean look to your left your right behind you a but like look somewhere bro cuz they're about to get you and sure enough one of the girls she gets within six feet of Shawn and she yells surrender now you don't know my buddy Shawn like I know my buddy Shawn you're probably thinking oh Yeah Shawn's about to get down and put his paintball gun up over his head but when Shawn heard the word surren immediately right behind him he turned around and went and lit that girl up like a Christmas tree and y'all we were we were having fun and it was competitive but then it got a little bit out of hand right after that if you know what I'm saying and I tell you that story because what my buddy sea did reminds me a lot of what the devil often does you see the devil is already a defeated foe but he's still going to fight and he does not fight fair he fights dirty he fights to cause destruction he fights to cause division he fights to cause uh to make you delusional he fights to cause dysfunction I want you to know today you're in a fight but it's a fixed fight that means the battle has already been won and the outcome has already been determined yet you still got an enemy and you you still got to get up and choose to fight every single day and so for the next few minutes I want to share four things with you I believe the Apostle Paul shared with us in Ephesians chapter 6 to help us experience victory in the area of spiritual warfare in our lives the first thing you need to do in spiritual warfare number one you need to recognize the real fight you got to recognize the real fight in Ephesians 6 vers vers 12 the Apostle Paul wrote for we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies but against evil rulers and authorities of the Unseen World against Mighty powers in the dark world and against evil spirits in the Heavenly places and often times we are so quick and even dare I say so careless to miss the real battle that's actually taking place before us we forget that everything is more spiritual than we realize there's more going on spiritually than what I can often see physically and friend it is a costly mistake to spend all your time and all your energy trying to fight against flesh and blood instead of taking the fight where it really belongs we have spouses fighting against each other instead of fighting for one another we've got parents and children fighting against each other inste instead of fighting for each other we've got Christians in our churches who are at odds against each other fighting over anything and everything but rarely fighting over the right thing and God didn't call us to fight over one another or he called us to fight for each other as the body of Christ in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ and as long as we are preoccupied distracted and caught up in fighting the wrong fights we will never give ourselves a fighting chance to win the right fight and the most important fight you see family eternity is on the line heaven and hell are real we cannot afford to get distracted or divided by the enemy we need to remember we are not fighting against people but God has called us to fight for people we need to stay focused on the right fight and every day we got to wake up and choose to keep fighting the right fight the right way we need to recognize the real fight number two you need to get dressed for battle you need to get dressed for battle Paul would continue in verse 13 therefore put on every piece of God's armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil then after the battle you will be standing firm so many people are not experiencing spiritual victory in their lives because they are trying to withstand to stand firm against the attacks of Satan without preparing for battle by putting on the armor of God I love how how Paul says put on every piece of God's armor every piece of God's armor is essential and it matters but it starts with the belt of Truth in verse 14 Paul says stand your ground putting on the belt of Truth you see Paul would have understood that whenever a Roman soldier Was preparing to engage in hand toand combat he would take the tunic that he was wearing and he would tuck it into his belt or his waist belt if you will that way he could be prepare he was preparing his stance it was a it was a posture of Readiness and you see the belt of truth it's a picture to us of Readiness and preparation against the lies and the deceptive schemes of our enemy the devil think about what Jesus said about our enemy The Devil in John 8:44 he was a murderer from the beginning he has always hated the truth because there is no truth in him when he lies it is consistent with his character for he is a liar and the father of Lies unfortunately too PE many people cannot recognize the enemy's lies and they actually believe the lies of the enemy because they are not spiritual ready to fight against the lies in the deception but until you acknowledge that there is an enemy swinging for your head you're going to leave yourself vulnerable and open and defenseless against the devil until you understand that hell is actually the one coming against your marriage and your family you're always going to be going out at it with your spouse and your kids until you recognize until you are committed to fight the right fight you'll always be easy prey and playing into the enemy's hand because you're fighting the wrong fight that's why Paul says we have to be on our guard we have to stand firm we have to stay ready and put on the belt of Truth in verse 14 he continues he says and put on the body armor of God's righteousness also known as the breastplate of righteousness the breastplate was the piece of armor that a soldier had that would cover his heart and also protect his vital organs and it makes me think about what the Bible says in proverbs 4 verse 23 Solomon said above all else you guard your heart it's not just a a military idea it is a spiritual idea it's a spiritual instruction to guard your heart spiritually speaking we guard our heart with the breastplate of God's righteousness and there are two aspects of righteousness that we need to understand if I could per perhaps the simplest way I could break this down is to recognize there's God's part in righteousness and then there's our part in righteousness there's right standing and then there is right living there's a righteous standing with God and then there's a righteous living of the believer you see right standing with God that's referring to the finished work of Salvation through Jesus's sinless life that he live dying that Sinner's death and then conquering death in the grave and being the atonement for our sin he alone made us put us in right standing with God when we receive the free gift of Salvation that is right standing that's the work of Christ but then there's righteous living and that's our responsibility as followers of Jesus to live a life that is obedient and in alignment with the truth the authority and the power of God's word listen friend God doesn't call us to avoid sin because he doesn't want us to enjoy life you see God wants to keep us from the pain and ultimately the devastating price that comes with unrighteousness God doesn't want us to avoid hatred Pride sexual immorality greed and materialism because it's good for us I think sometimes we forget that God better understands better than anybody else how deadly and how costly sin is because he's the one that gave up his one and only son to pay for it he better understands than anybody else does so when Satan attacks us by tempting us to compromise and to give into sin God's word tells us we need to put on the breastplate of righteousness to guard our hearts it's why we avoid certain people it's why we avoid certain places and certain things that cause us to drift away or cause us to stumble away from Christ we need to identify those things and then we have to run from them Paul said in Romans 12:9 he says you have to hate what is evil and you got to cling and hold fast to what is good I love this because there is no gray or ambiguity it's black and white you hate What God Says is evil you hate what he considers unrighteous and you hold fast you cling you hold tightly to what he says is good and righteous People's Church we're in a battle we cannot flirt with sin we can't wink at Temptation we can't toy around with the devil's schemes don't see how close you can get to the fire without getting burned I heard a preacher say one time if you don't want to slip and fall then don't dance where it's wet man if you don't want to slip and fall then don't dance where it's wet if you're going to stand strong in your faith and in your spiritual battles you have to be diligent and intentional every moment of every day to God guard your heart put on the breastplate of righteousness in verse 15 Paul continued he says for shoes put on the shoes of peace that comes from the good news so that you will be fully prepared he's talking about the shoes of the gospel of peace and in our culture shoes are more of a a fashion icon or a fashion statement more than anything else probably right but if you look at the original purpose of shoes it's actually to provide protection for our feet in fact when you look at what ancient Roman soldiers would do with their shoes they had Rock embedded at the bottom almost like think about like a football cleat or a or a soccer cleat that's how their shoes were designed with the purpose of providing them stability so that in combat when engaging With the Enemy they wouldn't slip and they would never fall down exposing themselves to be vulnerable before their opponent and Paul says that in the same way we have to put on the shoes of peace and that peace comes from the good news of Jesus Christ and all of us here today we know the bad news we know that we're imperfect people who live in a fallen world we know that we have flaws we have insecurities we have weaknesses and issues and mistakes that we've made we know that none of us are good enough to save ourselves and transform ourselves from the inside out none of us are spiritually enough or spiritually strong enough to overcome sin and get victory over temptation but how many of you are thankful for the good news of of the Gospel today that Jesus said my peace I give you my peace I leave with you I give you a peace that the world cannot give because it never belonged to the world in the first place he says my peace I give you when all hell is breaking loose in our lives when we're going through dark storms when we're in the heat of battle when the world around us is dark delusional and divided we can still have peace you can have a peace of God that's with you no matter who else is against you and no matter what you're going through you can have peace that God is working on your behalf and fighting on your behalf for your good and for his glory you can have peace that Jesus is in control and that he alone is Sovereign over everything you see Financial storms will come and go emotional storms they'll come and go relational storms they'll come and go but the peace of God is here to stay and it anchors our souls in the middle of every storm every situation and every battle I don't know who I'm preaching today I might be preaching to myself but I'm thankful for the peace of God that surpasses all understanding all explanation and Paul says when when you put on the shoes of peace you're fully prepared in battle it anchors our souls in verse 16 Paul continues in the armor of God he says in addition to all of these hold up the shield of Faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil in battle a shield was used by soldiers to proect to protect themselves from rocks and swords and other projectiles and weapons used against them in verse 16 Paul specifically mentioned mention that the fiery arrows the devil shoots at God's children which is exactly why we need the shield of Faith you see even from the be very beginning the deceiver has always wanted to sew seeds of demonic doubt into the heart and mind of every believer he shoots arrows of doubts like if if God really loved you then why did he allow that thing to happen to you you can't live for God you can't be a Christian you're not holy enough you're not spiritual enough you can never be used by God you'll never be free from addiction you'll never be free in your finances what do you mean a healthy marriage you'll never have a healthy marriage you'll never have a healthy family you'll never be a good parent and that's exactly where the shield of faith comes in against all those doubts because the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 11 that faith is the substance it's the confidence of what we hope for it's assurance about what we do not physically see with our eyes God has called us to be people who walk by faith and not by sight people who will trust in his word every truth and every promise you see God honors big Faith because big Faith honors God and we have to hold on to the promises of God so that we can hold up the shield of Faith against all the fiery arrows of doubt that the enemy tries to shoot against us we have to to hold up the shield of faith and in verse 17 Paul instructed us to put on salvation as your helmet the helmet of salvation now this is important Paul is not specifically talking about the the moment of Salvation if you will or the act of Salvation it's in other words it's less about the event and more about the attitude in other words Paul's saying guard your heart guard your mind guard your head with the attitude that you've been saved you are saved and you will be saved you see not only are we waiting to receive eternal life in Heaven someday but we as Believers on the earth we already have eternal life because of Jesus you see as followers of Jesus we're blessed now but we still anticipate and look ahead and look forward to the Eternal promise the Eternal blessing that is to come so no matter how the devil tries to attack you you have a present and eternal hope that nobody else and nothing else can take from you this is where our mind should always be church family the enemy is coming after your head but praise God you've got the helmet of salvation you've got a hope that can never go away because it is rooted and grounded in Jesus Christ in the promise of heaven and eternal life a third thing we need to do in spiritual warfare you need to learn how to use your sword learn how to use your sword Paul continued in verse 17 take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God I want you to know this this is the only offensive piece of armor mentioned in scripture In this passage it's because God has not called us as Christians and Believers to play Passive preventative defense in life hear me today God has not called you to play with the let's play not to lose attitude no God has given us his word God has given us a weapon he has given us his sword because we're supposed to be on the offensive we're supposed to storm the gates of hell we're supposed to take charge and take ground for the Kingdom of Heaven on this Earth and in our lives every single day you see God provided us with his word as a weapon and we even see in Matthew chapter 4 it's Jesus used the word of God as his weapon against the enemy when he tried to tempt him in the Wilderness over and over and over again it is written it is written it is written Jesus started swinging and the devil started running and that's what exactly what happens when you use the word of God as your sword I'm thankful that I've got this thing from my quiet time in my daily devotions every single day but I also got it in times that aren't quiet if you know what I'm saying this word of God it's alive and active it is our weapon and our sword Hebrews 4:12 it says the word of God is alive and active it's sharper than any double-edged sword the enemy he's defeated by the word of God he's crushed by the power and the weight of the authority that God's word carries and the last thing he would want you to do today is learn how to swing your sword learn how to carry and use this weapon because he knows that if you do you'll start doing damage and giving blows to the enemy and to every force of Hell read the word of God study the word of God memorize it stand firm on it declare its truth and Promises over your life and when you do that the better and stronger you'll be at wielding your sword and the greater threat you will be to the kingdom of darkness you need to learn how to use your sword and lastly number four you need to master the weapon of prayer Verse 18 Paul instructed us to pray in the spirit on All Occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests he says with this in mind be alert always keep on praying for all the Lord's people church we will never win spiritual battles until we truly learn what it means to really pray prayer is not a luxury it is a critical necessity but too many times we treat it like it's a luxury and that's one of our greatest mistakes in spiritual warfare we see something happen in the Physical Realm we weren't prepared for or it caught us off guard and we do one of those 91 one emergency prayers oh Lord oh God help me Jesus Christ y'all I'm thankful we Ser we serve a God who will hear us in those 911 prayers and come through I'm thankful God's come through in those moments for me but the best time to prepare for battle is before the battle not in the middle of it so before the storm comes before the enemy comes in be prepared be on your knees in prayer pray over your family pray over your home pray over your finances pray over your co-workers pray over your bosses pray over your church family pray over your city pray on your lost loved ones and your family and your friends pray for wisdom and victory in your life God has given us the weapon of prayer and when you call on the name of Jesus in prayer baby Devils don't just tremble and get afraid the Bible says that they flee cuz there's power and authority When you pray pray in the name of Jesus come on the name that's higher than any other name the name that's greater than any enemy we face in life you see God is a god of Victory you don't have to live in fear of the devil or his schemes or what he's got cooking in the kitchen because Victory Is Ours in Christ Jesus you friend you don't need to live another moment broken defeated and hopeless because if you will commit your life to fighting spiritual battles God's way the Holy Spirit Will unleash his power in your life and a supernatural Way Church family God's called you not just to fight but to fight to win man today will you recognize the real fight put on the armor of God hold up your Shield hold up your sword go to battle knowing Victory already belongs to you

my word my dj yeah breakthrough in 22. i'm sure every one of us in this room if we were honest there is an area or even areas in our life where we need a breakthrough maybe it's something at work maybe it's with our family maybe it's our own personal health or mind or mental health physical health maybe it's in a a relationship uh i think every one of us would say there's an area that we would that we could need that we need a breakthrough matter of fact because many of us know we need a breakthrough a lot of people right now we're making new year's resolutions and plans and you know they're going to making choices to stop doing these things and start doing these things because they need a breakthrough maybe it's a breakthrough in your finances maybe it's a breakthrough in your friendships or in your health or your mind or your mental health maybe it's a breakthrough at school with grades with the teacher or with an addiction maybe it's a breakthrough with your children or your marriage and so right now many are setting goals and they're making changes so that they can have a breakthrough in 2022. i am i just turned 41 years old and i've been a christian for 23 years of my life and before i gave my life to christ y'all i was the hot mess express like after i gave my life to jesus i still needed all sorts of breakthrough i needed breakthrough with my anger i needed breakthrough with my mouth it was foul and just cussing all the time i needed i needed a breakthrough with sexual sin i needed a breakthrough with addiction to alcohol like i had all kinds of issues even after i got saved i i needed breakthrough in my finances i needed there was a season i needed breakthrough in my marriage i needed breakthrough in my mental health anxiety got a hold of my life and it had a grip on me and i needed a breakthrough when it came to anxiety i needed a breakthrough with my regular health and cholesterol and weight and different things i've had so many areas in my life where i needed breakthrough and with god's help i can tell you that i have experienced a breakthrough in every single one of those areas sometimes the breakthrough is instant sometimes it takes time and even today this year i still have areas that i need break through in my life and the reason i share with that to you today is not to boast i want to encourage you listen if god could help me have a breakthrough god can help you have a breakthrough i am nobody special but our god is special mighty and powerful and with god you can have a breakthrough in 2022. matter of fact i am believing that 2022 is going to be your year of breakthrough breakthrough in your relationships in your health your parenting your career breakthrough in your marriage your finances breakthrough in your singleness that this of this is a year of breakthrough breakthrough is gonna happen for you in 2022. does anybody receive that today come on do you receive that word you're like pastor i don't even know how but yes amen i need a breakthrough and today i want to talk to you about one of the major keys to breakthrough matter of fact every breakthrough that i just shared with you and even others every breakthrough that i have experienced had this ingredient had this had this major key had this component a part of it and that is the power of prayer the power of prayer prayer is a major key to experience a breakthrough prayer is our response to the impossible and to barriers that keep us from victory and it was a major key it's been a major key to every every breakthrough i have experienced from god and i want you to know today that victory is possible in 2022 because we're going to begin this year with prayer that 2022 is going to be your year of breakthrough because you're going to pray like you've never prayed before and i want to help you with that today listen don't begin this new year worrying begin the new year praying begin it praying your breakthrough won't come from worrying i never got a breakthrough from worrying matter of fact worry just gave me more areas i needed a breakthrough all right and see worrying is useless but prayer is useful worrying causes stress but prayer removes stress worrying brings a heaviness but prayer brings a lightness worrying brings burdens prayer brings a breakthrough come on everybody say breakthrough i want you to listen to the words that jesus shared on the sermon of the mountain matter of fact as i read this passage of scripture i believe god wants to speak these words directly to you today right here in this room and so as i read this passage as you read that i want you to take them as jesus is talking directly to you matthew chapter 6 verses 25 through 34 this is what jesus is saying to you he says therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more than food in the body more than clothes he's saying to you when you when you drive home or you're sitting at your house or you're outside or looking out the window look at the birds in the air they do not sow or reap or stow away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they can any one of you by worrying at a single hour to your life and why do you worry about clothes see how the flowers of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you that not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god closed the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more close you you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own and today i want to encourage you don't worry but pray seek god first 2022 is your year of breakthrough if you choose to pray instead of worry and jesus said listen listen here's what you need to do you need to seek me first how do we seek him first pray pray listen listen i want everybody ever been in a sporting event and someone's saying they're number one they put one finger up in the air you know we're number one we're number one you know what i mean i ever seen that so i need everybody here come on just come on give me a number one come on yeah that's right that's right you're number one in god's eyes you need to know that all right but here's what i love about this keep your hand up keep your hand up come on keep you know what i love not only are we putting up the number one but we're pointing to god i want you to live 2022 like this god is number one he's number one every morning matter of fact wake up out of your bed before you even rise up just point a finger up in the air god's number one today number one when you walk into work people gonna think you crazy walk up in there when you walk up into your school they're like what are you doing god's number one he's number one i'm putting him first i'm seeking him first i'm finding him first okay he is number one see for most people when they get stressed or worried they start texting people calling people maybe they start an old habit maybe they binge watch their favorite soul but jesus said no no no no no seek first seek first his kingdom that word seek means pursue request fine how do you have breakthrough in 2022 seek pursue god first request him first find him first and one of the ways that we see god first is prayer we're having 28 days of prayer fasting because we're seeking god first we worship we seek seek god first when we pray fast and worship we are pursuing the kingdom of god we are pursuing righteousness pursuing to be more like jesus and he said seek first see when we seek first we don't worry we worship we don't fear we fast we don't panic we pray and prioritizing god's kingdom in this way listen it doesn't mean that you won't experience challenges and suffering but your life will be aligned under his kingdom authority so that you can experience his provision come on when trouble comes come on we're walking out of church today like i'm walking into starbucks people just gonna think i'm crazy i don't leave a i'm having breakthrough in 2022 and it comes from putting his first my daughter callie plays softball she was on a travel team uh this this last year and so we were at a lot of softball games got up got a picture of her in her softball uniform and um cali was was a decent little player and um one of the things that she did again obviously i'm assuming everybody knows how to play softball or baseball if you don't when you hit the ball you got to run to first base that's why they call it first base you go there first please don't run to second or third or just stand on home you got to run to first base where you're going to get out okay and so one of the things that callie would do though is that when she got a hit when she was running to first base she would always watch what the fielder was doing she's like watching them catch it and bring it she's just watching them the whole time and as long as she was watching them while she was running to first it slowed her down and so i i would i'm not a coach but i try to coach i'm like halle kelly don't watch the ball and what the players listen when you hit the ball just run as hard and as fast as you can to first base just focus on don't get distracted with what's going on in the field you just run as hard and as fast as you can to first and what's happening to a lot of us spiritually is we're getting hits but we're getting distracted by everything else going on and we are not running hard and fast to god first and one run hard and to god first some of us we're trying to hit doubles and triples and home runs but we're not focused on first base we're not even making it to first base listen you could hit it out the park but if you skip first base touch second third and home they're going to tag you with that ball and you are out you cannot skip first space and so a lot of people are not focusing on god first and we are getting out in life listen god cannot be second so you gotta ask yourself are you putting god's kingdom first ask yourself this question when when i need guidance to make a decision when i'm stressed when i need a breakthrough in my life where do i go first you got to go to god first and god teaches us one of the ways we go to him first one of the keys to breakthrough is prayer look what uh paul says to the church of philippi philippians 4 6 paul says don't worry about anything instead pray about everything tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done don't worry pray pray about everything go to god first breakthrough is possible in 2022 when we pray and we seek god first and so i want to give you a for i want to challenge you when you pray in four ways okay four ways first is this when you pray pray bold prayers pray bold prayers james challenges us in james chapter one verse 5 and 6. it says if you don't know what you're doing pray to the father he loves to help ask boldly believing without a second thought you know the bible is full of people that prayed bold prayers zechariah and elizabeth were praying for a child in their old age and the angel came and said the lord has heard your prayer and and blessed them with john the baptist elijah he prayed down fire from heaven joshua prayed for the son to stand still and it stood still paul and silas were beaten and whipped and thrown into prison but the bible says late in the midnight hour they were praying and there was an earthquake that shook the whole prison set them and every prisoner free even on the cross there was a thief on the cross who prayed a bold prayer jesus saved me and jesus said you will be with me in paradise listen you are one bold prayer away from your breakthrough god is not intimidated by your bold prayers pray bold prayers uh the author mark batterson he wrote the book circle maker it's maybe one of my favorite books on prayer i would encourage you to buy it and read it if you haven't but he said this he said bold prayers honor god and god honors bold prayers god isn't offended by your biggest dreams or boldest prayers he is offended by anything less if your prayers aren't impossible to you they are insulting to god look at what a father whose son was demon possessed says to jesus in mark chapter 9 verse 23 22-23 it says the spirit often throws him into the fire and into water trying to kill him have mercy on us and help us if you can what do you mean if i can jesus asked anything is possible if a person believe jesus said anything come on everyone say anything anything is possible if you believe don't be afraid to pray bold prayers breakthrough happens when we pray bold prayers let me ask you this what bold prayers do you need to pray in 2022 what have you been afraid to ask god what have you thought is too big for god maybe not worth his time i want you to make a list would you make a list in 2022 of big bold prayers and start praying them i got a list of big bold prayers i'm praying for my family i got a list of big bold prayers i am praying for our church hey come on well you know what one of them is we're believing in 2022 we're going to get a new building if you don't want to pray a big bold prayer will you at least pray that one with us come on pray we're going to get a building we're going to own our own building in 2022 pray big bold prayer joshua prayed for the sun to stand still i prayed i asked god god i pray for no snow on sundays i know something like well i saw some snow this i don't mind that snow god knows the snow i'm talking about i want no massive amounts of snow on sunday where people are like oh there's too much snow to go to church no i think we're just gonna stay home i'm praying my parking lot men are like oh and parking lot women are like thank you jesus pastor come on hey pray big bold prayers pray them and i know there's even more bolder prayers than that but what prayers do you need to start praying number two don't just pray bold prayers but pray specific prayers in mark 10 jesus encounters a blind man on the streets of jericho mark 10 verse 51-52 he says what do you want me to do for you jesus jesus asked my rabbi the blind man said i want to see and jesus said to him go for your faith has healed you and instantly the man could see and he followed jesus down the road the blind man was specific he said i want to see i was thinking like why wouldn't we pray specific prayers i think there's a couple reasons i think one some of us we don't believe that god wants to bless us that for some of us because of guilt or insecurity we don't want to press our luck with god so i don't want to ask god too much lord if it's not there's never too much pray specific prayers he's a good good father he wants to bless you and do a work in and through he does not want to withhold from you he has something for you jesus speaks of the father's goodness in matthew 7 i want to help some of you today matthew 7 verse 9 through 11 jesus said you parents if your children ask for a loaf of bread do you give them a stone instead or if you ask for a fish do you give them a snake of course not so if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly father give good gifts to those who ask them listen god wants to bless you and so be specific with your prayers matter of fact the more specific your prayers are it invites god into your situation to bring a breakthrough matter of fact the more specific your prayers are the more glory that god receives see our nuanced prayers they give god an opportunity to reveal more shades of his sovereignty when we're vague we can we can then leave chance that maybe it was not god and something else that blessed us but when you get specific and you write them out and you see god move in a specific way god gets all the glory so pray specific prayers breakthroughs come from specific prayers let me give you some examples instead of praying god bless my family i mean that's a great prayer to pray god bless my family i want to challenge you to get more specific list out your family members name by name because each one of them are unique and different different stage of life going through different things and write out prayers you want to specifically pray for each one of them instead of just praying god help me get healthy come on put a number with it god help me lose this amount of weight help me get down to this weight god help my cholesterol get to this number help my blood pressure get to like get specific pray a specific number god make the ice cream taste like cardboard and smell like broccoli you never know but you gotta pray specific or maybe a better one's just like god help me have self-control help me to do push-aways when i'm full help me to to walk away help me to say no help me to eat one scoop instead of two i mean just get specific come on the single ladies some of you are like lord bless me with the husband maybe you better get specific god give me a man of god on fire for you responsible got a job lord and lord make them tall dark and handsome or short and blonde whatever you prefer but hey get specific with your prayers get specific fellas do this hey get special lord i need you to love jesus godly woman beautiful and get specific in your in in in your in your prayer nothing wrong god wants specific prayers get specific write it out write out a lit make your top 10 list and pray over it pray for it and when you just instead of asking god just to bless your finances get specific pray for a raise pray for a specific job pray for the specific hours don't settle lord just give me whatever lord i'm just so i just take whatever listen i mean god will just give you whatever but god will give you a specific give him the time the place how long you want to drive how much you need to make pray specifically for the re pray for your savings pray for college pray pray about getting out of debt and what you can cut god show me what to cut and the changes i can make god help me to give more god i mean just just get specific come on instead of just praying for the colts to win the super bowl pray for all the other players to pull their hamstrings i mean you got to get specific i'm joking y'all i'm joking you can pray for the coast to win the super bowl i don't know if god cares but don't pray for anybody to get injured okay don't don't do the watch i'm gonna pull a hamstring today the lord's gonna be like better you better stop that but pray specific in school pray for each class pray for the assignments teachers relationships get specific with your friends list them out by name if you don't have friends you need some better friends ask god specifically for the kind of godly friends that you need in your life he loves you he's a good father make a list pray specifically and watch what god does listen the greatest tragedy in life is the prayers that go unanswered because they go unasked pray specifically thirdly when you pray pray persistent prayers pray persistent prayers matthew 7 7 through 8 it says keep on asking and you will receive what you asked for keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and the door will be open to you for everyone who asks receives everyone who seeks fines and to everyone who knocks the door will be open jesus is indicating the importance of persistent prayers in our lives see prayer is an earthly request for heavenly intervention it doesn't make god do what's outside of his will but it releases him to do what is inside of his will and so ask seek and knock for what we need according to his will and you may be asking well pastor how long should i ask seek and knock until you get an answer until you get an answer keep asking keep seeking keep on knocking we serve a good father and he'll always give an answer he gives three answers yes no or wait yes no or wait and until you get an answer keep on praying i i do a prayer list every year because if i don't if i don't get specific and i don't write it on my prayer list it's probably not going to get prayed for i'm just going to be honest with you and so i have a 2021 list that i listed out and i had my own things i had my my family members listed out and things i was praying specifically for them i had other friends and had other things things with the church and whatnot and finances a lot of different things on there that were my own but then oftentimes i get prayer requests and so when people give me prayer requests i go and i put them on that list specifically on there and i i prayed and uh you know in the past whenever a prayer got answered i just took it off the list and kept praying for the ones that hadn't got answered this year uh all the prayers that were answered i actually put them in a separate spot for answered prayer so it's kind of cool at the end of the year i could go back and thank god for all the answered prayer but you know what i still had a ton of unanswered prayer from 2021 and i'm like well what do i do with these i move them to 2022. i'm gonna keep seeking keep asking and i'm gonna keep knocking until i get a yes or a no and in 2020 i'm gonna keep praying over them and if they don't get answered in 2022 guess what 2023 i'm gonna move them to the next left there is power in our persistent prayers in life listen you won't receive some breakthroughs without persistence see prayer should be our game plan not the hail mary too often prayers to hail mary no no no have a persistent prayer life i i love a pastor he taught me this early in my faith he i was i was i was in a funk and he said chris you need to pray through i'm like what does that mean you know you keep praying until you get a breakthrough i said man that could be a long time he said that's fine go down to the sanctuary see in a few hours and i just learned a valuable lesson there you gotta pray through until you get a breakthrough got to be persistent with my anger i had to pray through until i got a breakthrough years praying through until i got a breakthrough with my marriage i had to pray through until i got a breakthrough with unforgiveness i had to pray through until i got a breakthrough with the lost with loved ones that are lost have to pray to until i get i'm still praying through until i get a break so i've got many other things i'm still praying on be persistent when you pray and then number four is pray consistent prayers consistent prayers jesus himself had a consistent prayer life mark 1 35 says before day break the next morning jesus got up and he went on to an isolated place of prayer see consistency it compounds and there is something powerful about a consistent prayer life paul speaks of the consistency of prayer when he writes to the church of thessalonica in first thessalonians 5 17 in the new living translation he says never stop praying in the niv it says pray continually in some other translations it says pray without ceasing pray all the time another one says make your life a prayer come on if your life is not a life of prayer in 2022 make your life a life of prayer the early followers of jesus devoted themselves to prayer acts 2 42 it says all the believers devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and of fellowship and to sharing meals including the lord's supper and to prayer paul would later say in the book of colossians colossians 4 2 devote yourselves to prayer with an apart mind and a thankful heart listen devotions and having a prayer life it takes time and consistency one of the best things you can do to have a consistent prayer life is to participate in 21 days of prayer and fasting where we're believing through breakthroughs and but it's listen it's about consistency that's why it's not two days of prayer and fasting it's 21 days of prayer and fasting matter of fact some research shows that that it takes at least 21 days of consistency to form a new habit so don't get it twisted it's not 21 days of prayer and then you're done for the year no no it's 21 days of prayer and fasting to start a habit so you have 365 days of prayer you're praying every day because a consistent prayer life it will lead to breakthrough when jesus was teaching on prayer he didn't say give us this year our yearly bread or give us this week our weekly bread no no he said give us this day our daily bread some of you i know you have never attended a 6 a.m prayer meeting listen would you start in 2022 this year would you start something new would you join us 21 days of prayer and fasting come to the prayer meetings every morning 6 a.m monday through friday come to the prayer meetings on saturday at 9 00 a.m i'm telling you when you pray and when you fast you're going to see miracles you're going to see breakthrough you're going to see some of the specific things you're praying for you're going to see some of those prayers answered can i tell you one of the most powerful experiences i have every year from 21 days of prayer and fasting for as long as i've been doing it i've seen god answer items that i have listed on my prayer list but some of the most powerful things god has done is the work in me that i didn't even know he i needed him to do and i couldn't see it until i started to seek his face with 21 days of prayer and fasting it was the breakthrough i didn't even know i needed we all know right now we can make a big old long list and by all means make your list and bring it to god but i'm telling you when you deny yourself and when you fast and when you pray and if you'll consistently do it 21 days of prayer and fasting i guarantee you there's going to be another miracle it's a miracle you didn't even know you needed it's the breakthrough you didn't even know you needed it is the revelation you don't even know you need there are things that you can't even see and god says [Music] i can't wait as they press in for 21 days you can have breakthrough in 2022. let's pray bold prayers specific prayers persistent in our prayers and consistently pray and let's start with 21 days of prayer and fasting at the beginning of the message i shared with you all the breakthroughs god has given me i'm just i'm so thankful god has given me breakthroughs in so many areas of my life but can i tell you most of those breakthroughs most of them didn't come through one prayer most of those breakthroughs came through persistent and consistent prayer sometimes months sometimes years matter of fact i have some breakthroughs i'm still praying for it's been years and i'll pray however many more years it takes because we serve a faithful god and i'm telling you you go through 2022 like this [Music] god you're first giving you the first of my year 21 days of prayer i'm in i'm giving you these 21 days in january god i'm giving you every morning giving you the first of my day i'ma be in church every sunday i'm giving you the first of my week don't worry pray seek him first and you're gonna experience a breakthrough in 2022
jmiqdZ7YTUU,well today we are continuing our series called on it and today the title of my message is own your relationship with God a man uh recently went to a local gym to cancel his membership he said when I signed up I was given a brochure listing all the benefits to me signing up to the gym it said I would look better feel better I'd have more energy I would accomplish more in my life I would get healthier stronger but none of these things have happened the employee looked up his record in the computer and said excuse me sir but it says that you've only been here four times in the past year it looks like you signed up but you didn't show up oh I got a word for y'all today it looks like you signed up but you didn't show up and some of you feel like this man with your relationship with God when you began your relationship with God you heard about all the benefits of being a child of God you were excited and were full of expectations of what God was going to do in your life you said the prayer you signed up in your heart to be a Christian but you're not experiencing all the benefits you find yourself frustrated with God some of you are mad or God some of you are wondering if if this Christianity thing is real you're wondering if the promises of God are really true because they're sure not working for you the problem for a lot of lot of people is they signed up but they're not showing up they're not doing the theme verse of this series that I shared with you last Sunday listen if you missed last Sunday you have to go watch last Sunday's message it's up on our People's Church Indianapolis YouTube page go back listen to that message but here's the theme verse Philippians chapter 2: 12-15 Paul says therefore my dear friends if you have always obeyed not only in my presence but now much more in my absence continue to work out everybody say work out continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who works in you to Will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose Paul says we need to work out what God is working in us we learned last week that we have to work out our Salvation to see success in 2024 we have to overcome excuses and own our life and so today I want to talk to you about how to own your relationship with God you can't just sign up to be a Christian and then not show up and expect your relationship with God to grow and flourish it's your responsibility to work out your salvation with fear and trembling are you stuck spiritually because you're not working out your salvation are you compromising in areas of your life because you're not working out your salvation are are you lukewarm and just going through the motions or are you living in sin because you're not working out your salvation I want us to look at a story in the Bible of a man who was stuck spiritually he was lukewarm he was compromised he was living in sin and trying to cover it up he wasn't owning his relationship with God in Psalm 51 is a is a record or a journal entry of David's prayer to God after he had made the biggest mistake of his life he abused his power he committed adultery with a woman named basheba he then had her husband murdered and he tried to cover it all up this was a man known after God's Own Heart and he had drifted away from God he was living in sin he was playing Church games he he was making excuses and instead of owning his relationship with God he was trying to cover up his sin until one day Nathan the prophet confronts him about his sin and from that moment when David was confronted with his sin something shifted inside of him and he began to own his relationship with God today my hope in prayer is that something will shift on the inside of you and you would begin to own your relationship with God I I want to show you how David began to own his relationship with God David signed up and then he began to show up let me give you six ways to own your relationship with God six ways to show up and not just sign up number one is this you have to own your sin after David was confronted with his sin he finally began to own it look at Psalm 51 verse 3 and 4 he said wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me against you you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so you are right in your verdict and Justified when you judge David was owning his sin he said my iniquity my sin my transgressions my sin I sinned David acknowledged and confessed his sin David was done blaming people and circumstances for his sin he said I Sinn I did wrong I blew it and if you're going to own your sin you have to acknowledge and confess your sin you can't blame others make excuses justify it dismiss it ignore it or hide it you have to show up by owning your sin you have to acknowledge your sin and confess your sin listen to what David says in Psalm 51:9 hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity David understood the importance of acknowledging and confessing his sin to God listen to what he says in Psalm 325 then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin if you want to own your relationship with God and not just sign up but show up you have to acknowledge and confess your sin to God look at first John 1:9 it says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness when we own confessing God owns forgiving when we own confessing God owns forgiving have to acknowledge and confess your sin number two you have to own repenting before God David didn't just sign up for a relationship with God but he showed up by repenting before God Psalm 512 he says wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin David didn't want to continue in his sin he didn't just ask for forgiveness and then continue to sin no no he wanted to be changed he was no longer justifying his sin he was no longer making excuses he wanted to change he wanted his heart and his life to be different Psalm 51:7 he says cleanse me with hiss up and I will be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow hup was a plant you see it multiple times in the Old Testament in Exodus 12:22 hup was used by the Israelites to put the the Lamb's Blood on the the doorpost so that the death angel would pass by their home in Leviticus 14:4 and verse 6 hup was used to cleanse defiled skin and Leviticus 14 49-52 it was used to cleanse mold in home homes in numbers 196 it was used to make the cleaning water that they would use to to cleanse people David was saying God take the hisp that was used to cleanse the people the temple and clean my heart and life David wanted to be clean on the inside if you want to show up and not just sign up you have to repent of your sin when you show up you don't just want to be forgiven you want to be changed you want to be changed number three you have to own prayer the entire chapter of Psalm 51 is David's prayer to God David didn't allow his sin to stop him from praying he was filled with shame guilt Fear And Regret but he didn't just sign up he showed up and allowed these emotions to drive him to pray to God see the devil will try to use your sin to drive a wedge between you and God Revelation 1210 says that the devil accuses us day and night all day long he hurs accusations about you look at your sin look at your stupid decision you're a lousy Christian look at how you treat people and talk to people but hear me today don't let the devil put a wedge between you and God no matter what you've done or where you are in life you got to go to God in prayer and keep praying on praying to God every day come on on come to 6:00 a.m. prayer services tomorrow morning meet me here at 6: a.m. on praying first don't just sign up show show up show up number four you have to own your desperation for the presence of God Psalm 5111 David saido not cast from me your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me David knew how much he needed the presence of God he had known the presence of God since he was a boy it was the presence of God that helped him defeat a lion and a bear when he was taking care of his daddy's sheep it was the presence of God that helped him defeat a giant named Goliath it was the presence of God that when King Saul was trying to kill him saved him it was the presence of God that helped him become king he knew all his successes came because the presence of God he was desperate for the presence of God he knew how how much he needed the presence of God when you start owning your relationship with God you realize how much you need the presence of God you become desperate for the presence of God you want to confess your sin you want to repent of your sin you don't want to lose the presence of God you cry out like David Don't Take Your Presence from me come on May we show up like David by having a desperation for the presence of God number five you have to own worshiping God Psalm 51 verse 14 and 15 David said deliver me from the guilt of Bloodshed oh God you who are my God my savior and my tongue will will sing of your righteousness open my lips Lord and my mouth will declare your praise I know David had to be weary from his sin his heart was Heavy the guilt was strong but he knew the importance of worshiping God he didn't let his sin shame and guilt deter him from praising God in the middle of owning his sin owning repenting owning prayer owning the presence of God he knew he needed to own worshiping God David knew the power of praise and worship it was David who wrote these words Psalm 34:1 I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth when you own your worship you bless the Lord at all times the good times and the bad times the high moments and the low moments when you do the right thing and when you do the wrong thing when you're strong and when you're weak when you feel like it and when you don't feel like it that is owning your worship some of you you need to stop owning worshiping God don't let your sin mistakes and failures stop you from worshiping god listen we don't worship because we're worthy we worship because he's worthy God is worthy come on I said our God is worthy to be worshiped don't let your feelings stop you from worshiping God don't let your sin mistakes and failures stop you from worshiping God because God is worthy don't let your problems stop you listen worship isn't about how good you are it's about how good God is because God is good we worship I lift my voice because God is good I lift my hands because God is good I raise my praise because God is good come on own your worship show up to worship show up to praise own worshiping God and number six you have to own your spiritual growth one of the biggest lessons we learn from David is that at his lowest point of his life he owned his spiritual growth even though he sned Big Time against God he still wanted to be more like God he still wanted to to please God he wanted to obey God he wanted to follow God listen to the heartfelt Cry of this man who was desperate for God Psalm 51:10 David says create in me a pure heart oh God and renew a steadfast Spirit Within Me The Cry of his heart was a pure heart and a Stead fast Spirit he wanted to be faithful to God Psalm 51:12 he says Resto to restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing Spirit to sustain me David knew that Joy comes from following God and not only does Joy come from following God but peace comes from following God hope love blessings come from following God let me say to you like this 2024 will be your best year ever if it's your best year spiritually 2024 will be your best year ever if it's your best year spiritually if you will follow and Obey Jesus it will be your best year ever David Cried Out grant me a willing Spirit to sustain he he didn't want a stubborn heart he didn't want a rebellious heart he wanted a heart that followed after God because Peace Love joy and blessings come from God I want you to have a heart to follow and obey the Lord because I want your 2024 to be your best year ever and for that to happen it has to be your best year spiritually you have to follow and obey God in high school I played a low football it wasn't very good but I was big and so they put me on the old line and one day they wanted to try me out at guard if you're not a football fan you got the center in the middle you got the guard and you got to tackle and so today I got to try out guard I was excited because they were the plays that our our team ran to run the ball the guard would get to pull okay if you don't know what a pull is that means when they say hike instead of me going forward I pull around the center and and and I'm coming to look I'm just going to blow somebody up you know what I mean Pancake City I was like oh yeah this is my moment you know what I mean and so I get down in my position and we had a a a running back he was a senior he was a star big old boy Stephen Taylor he he could have been an old lineman to be honest with you but he was really fast as and so the play came and the quarterback said Hut and I'm turning and I'm like oh yeah and all of a sudden boom Stephen the running back knocked me clear out on the ground Smith you got to pull faster I was like that was my last time at guard they did not running back was like get up clean my clock that dude killed me and so many people they're getting killed in life they're getting their clock cleaned because they aren't running God's play for one year I want to give you a spiritual play to run at the end of 2024 your life will be better because of it and so for one year I want you to run this spiritual play come on come on don't just sign up show up don't

avRyrsgrTyg,"well today we are continuing our series on angels and demons and the title of my message today is how to activate angels in your life wouldn't it be pretty awesome if anytime somebody was messing with you you had an angel in heaven just zap them leave Chris alone but that's not what the bible teach us so we're going to dive in how to activate angels in your life uh Jamie and I we um we like to we love to travel now I would say we love to visit new places I don't always love the journey to get to the new place um how many of you driving a long road trip or flying on a plane and being at an airport for hours it brings you life and energy I mean some people they really invigorate them it gives them some energy okay good how many you like me like I'm worn out I am worn out after a day of travel whether it's in the car or on a plane you know I just just feel so bundled up on the you know it's just the seats are so small and um and there's been a couple times when we have uh traveled I mean I just can't wait to get into the hotel room like I can't wait to get in and just rest after the travel and there has been a time or two too we've had a long day of travel you know you go up you check in at the hotel and they give you your your key cards to your room and you go on the elevator and you go up to your floor and you get off and you you find your floor and you you know they give you that nice little sleeve and you pull out your key and there there's been a time or two where we pulled out that key and and put it up against the little sensor and it's like me and it's like a red flashes red you know how like how many you like me I'm like oh maybe I did the wrong side let me turn the car around you turn the card around do it again me me I'm like maybe I'm doing it too fast you know I need to slow you know Mimi RI like so what do you got to do got to go all the way back you know me I was just looking forward to just going into the room and relaxing so we'll go back to the the the checkin hey our key not working they're like oh sorry I must not have activated your key awesome thank you and so they you know they do a little thing little activate it you go back up go back up to the room praying over the card now I'm like Jesus please let this card work you know and then you you you you put it up and it's like and you know and then turns green and you can open the door and get in I think that was a pretty good uh sound effect right there if you've ever tried to get into a room so but you the get you got to get the key activated the key is not going to work unless it's activated then you can get in and relax and you know so many Christians miss out on so many blessings that God has for their life because they never activate their spiritual key card Jesus Paid the price on the cross so that you could access some amazing aming blessings but you have to activate the key card we're in a series called angels and demons and we've been learning about angels the last three weeks and most Christians don't understand that they play a role in activating Angels into their life and situations and so today I want to teach you how to activate Angels but before we look at how to activate angels I first want to caution you not to become fixated on Angels being consumed with angels can lead you down a path of false Doctrine we see this in the early church Colossians 2: 18- 19 it says do not let anyone who Delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen they are puffed up with idle Notions by their unspiritual spiritual mind they have lost connection with the head from whom the whole body supported and held together by its ligaments and Senus grow as God causes it to grow so don't don't lose your connection with Jesus by fixating on Angels the gospel isn't about angels it's about Jesus you don't pursue Angels you pursue you pursue Jesus You Don't See seek Angels you seek Jesus you don't worship Angels you worship Jesus and with that said let's look at what different people in the Bible uh did in the Bible excuse me let's look at what different people did in the Bible uh that led to Angels being activated in their life and so I have four insights four insights on how to activate angels in your life from the Bible and biblical stories the first Insight is this be aware of the spiritual realm be aware of the spiritual realm there is a spiritual realm that you cannot see and the Unseen spiritual realm is just as real as what you can see just like you can't see gravity but it's real I discover that every time I'm on the basketball court you can't see aerodynamics but it's real you can't see electricity but it's real and because you're you're aware of gravity aerodynamics electricity you use them to benefit your life and the Bible tells us we need to be aware of the spirit realm so that it can bless your life Ephesians chapter 6:12 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in Heavenly Realms the Bible says be aware of the spirit Realm realize there's more to life than what you can see and if you don't win if you want to win the battles of life you need to realize there's a spirit realm there are angels and demons 2 Corinthians 4:18 so he fix our eyes not on what is seen But on what is unseen since what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal the Bible is Raising awareness that there's an Unseen World that we need to pay attention to don't just fix your eyes on what you can see you also have to fix your eyes on what you can't see because there really are angels and demons 2 Corinthians 10: 3-4 for though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds we have have weapons that the world does not have the weapons of prayer and praying in the spirit the weapons of fasting worship God's word and the supernatural weapons of angels for some of you to see Angels activated in your life it starts with you becoming more aware of the spirit realm you can't keep fighting the battle battles of life the way the world does some of you are dealing with problems just like the world does but you need to activate your spiritual the spiritual key and start fighting with spiritual weapons God has given you access to divine power so don't fight like the world activate your spiritual weapons because there's an Unseen World number two the second Insight is resist demonic attacks resisting demonic attacks can activate angels in your life when Daniel resisted the Demonic attack from King Darius God sent Angelic help the king in his cabinet told everyone they had to pray only to King Darius the people were ordered by the government to not pray to God if they prayed to God instead of King Darius they would be thrown into the lion's den look at Dan Daniel 6:13 then they said to the King Daniel who is one of the Exiles from Judah pay no pays no attention to you your majesty or to the decree you put in writing he still prays three times a day Daniel resisted the evil King's request and continued to pray to God and he was thrown into the lion's den look at Daniel 6:22 my God sent his angel and he shut the mouths of the Lions they have not hurt me because I was found innocent in his sight nor have I ever done any wrong before you your majesty notice Daniel didn't pray for Angelic help he just refus to give into the enemy's schemes one of the ways you activate Angels into your situation is to resist the devil's plans and schemes listen don't follow the ways of the world even when it's hard even when everybody else is doing it even when it's popular with culture resist the devil and honor God when Jesus was tempted by the devil and resisted his attacks God the Father sent Angelic help Matthew 4:11 then the devil left him and Angels Came and attended him Jesus resisted the devil and God the father said sent Angelic help and Jesus teaches us how to resist the devil in the previous Verses first we resist with the word of God there is power in God's word when you read God's word live God's word speak God's word obey God's word there's power it can activate Heaven's help Matthew 4:3 and 4 it says the tempter came to him and said if you are the son Son of God tell these stones to become bread Jesus answered it is written man shall not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God Jesus resisted the Devil with the word of God I can't count the number of times I have resisted the Devil with the word of God I'm constantly speaking God's word over my life to resist the devil that I am more than a conqueror for me and my house we will serve the Lord my God will supply all my needs according to his riches and Glory I will resist the devil and he will flee from me Church you have to resist the devil by speaking the word of God secondly resist with the fear of God the devil told Jesus to jump off the highest point of the temple Matthew 47 Jesus answered him it is also written do not put the Lord your God to the test Jesus said I'm not going to test God the father Jesus knew we don't test God we fear God Church you and I need to fear God not test God but so many people are lacking the fear of the Lord they know what the Bible says but then do the exact opposite they live however they want to live but when you fear God you live to please God fearing god listen it doesn't mean you have to be scared of God but it does mean you should have a deep awe and reverence for God and the fear of the Lord is a big deal in the Bible I mean it's talked about so many times and I believe it's in God's word so much because God knew Humanity would struggle fearing him when you lack the fear of God you forit the blessings of God so many blessings are activated in our lives When We Fear God I want to share with you six blessings God gives to those who fear Him there are more than six but quickly I want to highlight six blessings when you fear God number one is wisdom Proverbs 9:10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom secondly God speaks to those who fear Him Psalm 25:14 the Lord confides in those who fear Him thirdly protection for you and your children Proverbs 14:26 those who fear the lord are secure he will be a refuge for their children fourth is life Proverbs 19:23 fear of the Lord leads to life fifth is prosperity Proverbs 22:4 true humility and fear of the Lord leads to riches honors and long life and then number six is Angelic help Psalm 347 the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and he delivers them when you fear the lord God dispatches his angels to encamp around you don't test God fear God thirdly resist with worship when the devil told Jesus he would give them the kingdoms of this world if he would bow down to him Jesus resisted with worship Matthew 4:10 and 11 Jesus said to him away from me Satan for it is written Worship the Lord your God and serve him only then the devil left him and Angels Came and attended him see the devil is always trying to get you to worship something or someone besides God hear me today don't worship money don't worship possessions don't worship the devil don't worship this world worship God only when the devil attacks you resist by worshiping God I'm always resisting the Devil with word I'm constantly playing worship music in my car at the gym when I study when I'm on vacation in my house when I worship Jesus the devil flees worship is not just singing a song it's spiritual warfare My Worship is a weapon lifting my hands is a weapon singing praises to God is a weapon shouting unto God is a weapon it can activate Heaven's heal Into Your Life Worship the Lord number three the third insight to activating Angel's help is earnestly pray and seek God Acts chapter 12 ver 5-7 so Peter was kept in prison but the church was earnestly praying to God for him they weren't praying to an angel cuz we don't pray to angels we pray to God it says the night before Herod was to bring him to trial Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and centuy stood guard at the entrance suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and the light Shone in the cell he struck Peter on the side and woke him up quick get up he said and the chains fell off Peter's wrist because the church was earnestly praying God sent an Angel to get Peter out of prison the focus is not on the angel but on the fact that the church was earnestly praying some of you you're missing out on God sending his Supernatural help because you don't pray or you don't earnestly pray you have to earnestly pray the Bible says to pray and to never give up to ask seek knock keep asking keep seeking keep knocking we have 21 days of prayer happening in August because we know God sends help when we earnestly pray don't miss out on praying don't let the busyness of life keep you from earnestly praying join us for 21 days of prayer and pray for your lost son or daughter pray for your sick body pray for your finances pray for your future pray to be set free from that addiction pray for the trouble you're experiencing at work at your home and in your relationships because when you earnestly pray it a it it activates Heaven's help and then number four the fourth Insight is trust God at all times angels are activated in the lives of people who trust God Psalm 91 is all about trusting God Psalm 912 it says I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in whom I trust first trust God when you're being attacked in life you will encounter attack after attack from people and your spiritual enemy the question I want you to ask yourself is do you trust God when you're under attack do you depend on God do you lean on God or are you depending and trusting yourself Psalm 91:7 through 12 it says a thousand may fall at your side 10,000 at your right hand but it will not come near you you would only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked if you say the Lord is my refuge and you make the most high your dwelling no harm will overtake you no disaster will come near your tent for he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways they will lift you up in your hands so that you will not in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone when you're under attack make the Lord your Refuge if you make the Lord your Refuge not pills not alcohol not money not food if you make the Lord your Refuge not sex not social media not your own wisdom ideas or abilities but the Lord you will activate Heaven's help secondly trust God when you feel like giving up when Elijah was under attack from a lady named Jezebel she wanted Elijah dead she said she was going to pursue him and kill him and he ran for his life and he found himself depleted and depressed he trusted God with a raw and real prayer on The Darkest Day of his life want to read it together first Kings 19:4 through6 it says while he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness he came to a broom Bush sat down under it and prayed that he he might die I've had enough Lord he said take my life I am no better than my ancestors he was raw and real with God and God sent help then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep all at once an angel touched him and said get up and eat he looked around and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water he ate and drank and they lay down and then laid down again listen when you're facing the dark days of your life who do you run to do you run from God or to God from church or to church from the Bible or to the Bible from from serving at the church or to serving at the church from prayer or to prayer from Christian friends or to Christian friends from worship or to worship when you feel depressed and depleted you have to trust God when your emotions are all over the place trust God on on the dark days of your life trust God trusting God on dark days can activate God's Supernatural help into your situation and then lastly trust God when you don't want to do his will Jesus trusted God when it was difficult to do his father's will and God sent Angelic help Luke 2: 41-43 it says he withdrew about a stone's throw Beyond them knelt down and prayed father if you are willing take this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done Jesus trusted his father's will when it was hard and the Bible says an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him the prayer of surrender is one of the hardest prayers to pray you want to do your will you don't feel like doing what God Said you think your way is better than God's way God's way doesn't even make sense to you but when you choose to surrender to God's will will it can activate Heaven's help Lord not my will but yours be done it doesn't make sense to forgive the person who hurt me but I surrender to your will I don't want to love the person I disagree with but I surrender to your will it doesn't make sense to tithe and give God 10% of my income but I surrender to your will I want to have sex with my boyfriend or girlfriend but I surrender to your will I want to cuss that person out but I surrender to your will it hurts but I Surrender I'm in tears but I Surrender it's not easy but I Surrender not my will but yours be done when you surrender your will to God's will it will activate Heaven's help"
HcDHn9YL5EY,well today we are continuing our series called dis functional we're talking about relationships all relationships and I promise you that if you will attend every single week of this series your relationships will get better they'll get better and so as we continue the series today I was thinking about this past spring break my family and I we went to Edisto South Carolina and we've got to we wanted to get some sun we wanted the beach and so we specifically uh went to this beach and we had a wonderful time I got a couple pictures here and so here's my wife Jamie and our our little one Cohen and you see the the beautiful sunset it was a little chilly uh that day but we were having fun uh riding in the sand and there's my Cali girl she's living her best life she was the only one in the water uh the water in the ocean in March just was not super warm but she was loving it and swimming I went to about my knees and that was about it y'all that water was cold it was cold but while she was in the water my boys were having some fun in the sand Jay's working on his tan there and uh Cohen enjoyed burying him in the sand and one of the things that I love about being at the beach is just having a moment just to look out over just the water and the sunset and just to see all of God's beautiful creation and I don't know if if you're like me I like to people watch and just kind of watch and watch the waves in the ocean but I don't know if you ever noticed this but at a beach they have a pole and it has flags on it and the flagpole and those flags indicate how safe it is to go into the water and so if you didn't know this I'm helping you out if you go and you see the flags and there's a green flag it means low Hazard go enjoy the water and and just have tons of fun if there's a yellow flag that's medium Hazard hey there's some light Surfer currents you know so you just want to be aware if there's a purple flag that means there's a marine pest jelly fish stingrays a dangerous fish your brother will not be in the water if there is a purple flag I'm just fine sitting back in the sand I'm not doing that and then if there's a red flag that means High Hazard rough conditions such as the a strong serve and currents and then if there's a double red flag that means water is closed to public use and so these Flags serve as a warning system to let you know how safe it is to go into the water and sometimes there is a red flag up sometimes there are double red flags and there are people who will ignore those flags and still go into the water and put themselves at risk matter of fact there have been people when there's double red flags or red flags that have gone into the water they have gotten severely injured and some have even died because they ignored the red flags and the Bible gives us relationship red flag and relationships aren't working because people are ignoring the red flags married couples ignore the red flags parents and children ignore the red flags friendships at work with authority people ignore the red flags people date and ignore the red flags let me share with you one of the relationship Flags in the Bible Romans chapter 12 verse 2. the Bible says don't copy the behavior and customs of this world but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know God's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect scripture says don't copy the behaviors and customs of this world if you do marriage like the world does your marriage is in trouble if you do parenting like the world does you and your children are in trouble if you do friendships like the world does your friendships are in trouble if you handle toxic people and communication like the world does your relationships are in trouble and if you do dating like the world does you are in serious trouble see Society has an idea of what your relationship should look like Hollywood has an idea of what your relationships should look like social media will give you an idea of what your relationships should look like the devil has an idea of what he wants your relationships to look like a matter of fact the enemy he'll do anything he can to keep you from experiencing all God has for you but you also need to know God has a plan for your relationships and so today I want to teach you what the word the word of God says instead of what the world says and so as we look at relationships today today we're going to specifically look at dating I've titled this message why dating is not working and I want to help everyone get better and every message of this series you are all going to get better and I realize some of you are not in a dating season and you may be tempted to tune me out but please don't do that listen that's some of our problem let me explain you have kids that are dating or one day will be dating or you have grandkids you have a niece you have a nephew you have a friend who's dating and they need your wisdom they need your guidance on how to do dating a better way and if you don't take responsibility to teach them the words way God's way for dating I promise you the world will the world has no problem teaching them how to date and so we got to take the responsibility to teach those that are dating with the word says because the world's way is not the best way it's not the best way and so I want to share with you I want to start off with four ways of the world four ways of the world and if you copy the world's way you will get the world's results number one is this the world's way the first way of the world if you're not dating something is wrong with you the world makes you feel like a loser if you're not dating listen there's nothing wrong with you if you're not dating Paul talks about the gift of singleness in First Corinthians chapter 7 verse 38. it says so then he who marries the Virgin does right but he who does not marry her does better singleness is awesome it's amazing because you can give yourself fully to the Lord marriage is also awesome but as married folks we give ourselves to the Lord and to our spouse and the world wants you to feel like being single is a problem the world makes you feel like the more people you date the more important you are you know I mean people love to ask you oh do you have a boyfriend do you have a girlfriend they're seven years old they're 13. man leave them kids alone they don't need to be dating nobody let them play with their GI Joes and on their video games and May hey even adults leave them alone let them enjoy their singleness and giving themselves fully to the Lord and I just want you to know that being single is a great blessing there's nothing wrong with you if you're single there's nothing wrong with you if you choose to remain single you need to flourish in your singleness and I know one day some of you want to be married but you can be happy and thrive in your single season you don't need a man or a woman to be happy oh let me say that again rewind you don't need a man or a woman to be happy to make you happy and listen when you decide to date keep in mind dating is hard it's a good thing but it's hard according to Pew research 47 of all Americans say dating is harder today than it was 10 years ago among those who say dating is harder today 21 thinks it's because of increased risk including physical risks as well as risks of getting scammed or lied to other reasons people think dating is harder include technology and how dating has become more impersonal you know like back then we ain't had no text messages you had to ask somebody out to their face you had to walk up to them with a smile on your face I mean maybe you wrote them a little note will you date me yes or no Circle one please you know what I mean but you still had to hand it to him you know what I mean you still have like we didn't have all there were no FaceTime well no FaceTime back in the day you know you had to get on the phone and you're hoping your Mom and Dad aren't jumping on the other line listening to you like what are these children talking about they're talking about on the phone don't want no FaceTime you'd have no profile pics you know what I mean we live in a day and a time with all the dating apps you got this profile pic and you look at somebody's picture and then you go to meet them and you looking around like where in the world are they and you see somebody waving at you and you're like hi I'm gonna wear it and they're like oh it's me and you're like people be lying lying y'all it's rough in these dating streams don't be clowning on people that are seeing I'm not telling you it's nothing wrong with being single let me give you the second Way of the World number two dating someone is going to make me whole y'all remember the movie Jerry Maguire Tom Cruise comes in tears in his eyes you complete me y'all that's Hollywood right there Hollywood got you thinking Mr or Mrs Wright is the only way that you can be complete but you complete me it's dangerous because it implies you are less of a person on your own it creates an expectation that you will find someone that's going to fulfill your needs heal your wounds and make you happy that is the wrong expectation and wrong relationship expectations they lead to Crazy relationship frustrations listen finding Mr Mrs Right will not complete you it will expose you it will expose your baggage your insecurities and your unhealth when you believe some person is going to complete you you don't deal with your junk before you start dating and get married because you think the other person is the answer to your problems listen no one is going to complete you no one is going to fix you no one is going to make you whole no one can complete you only God can do that only God can complete you and so you have to allow God to complete you to heal you to make you whole you got to allow God God is the only one that can help you with that emotional baggage past relationship baggage childhood baggage past hurts baggage lack of trust baggage Financial baggage or addictions baggage listen you're undealt with baggage and unhealed hurts will only be magnified when you get into relationships it won't solve it it won't cure it no no it magnifies it so do business with God now no one will complete you except God let me give you the Third Way of the World and that is this dating is purely for fun first of all dating should be fun you should enjoy time with the person you date but the world says dating is just all about having fun just have fun just have a good time and if you have the wrong definition of dating you will end up with the wrong outcome here's what happens when dating is purely for fun when dating is purely for fun number one you date people who are not Christ followers when you follow the world's way you just date whoever is fine you get on that dating app and you just go out with anybody you might have a good time with listen the world's way is not the words way second Corinthians 6 14 the Bible says do not be yoked together with unbelievers for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common or what Fellowship can light have with Darkness God says you don't just date anybody it's not just all about fun you need some guidelines because the ultimate goal of dating is to find the person you're gonna marry and spend the rest of your life with that is the ultimate goal of dating and then so you can't just date purely for fun let me give you a second thing when dating is purely for fun you engage in sex the world's way is just have fun do whatever feels good have sex have a good time the world's way is it's your thing do what you want to do it's the world's way but it's not really your thing for you to do whatever you want to do let me show you what the word says in First Corinthians 6 19. it says do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have received from God you are not your own if you're a Christ follower you don't belong to you you belong to God so you don't do things the world's way you do things God's way you find out what God says about sex and you do sex God's way and sex is a great gift that God created it's a beautiful blessing in a marriage relationship outside of marriage is messy and dangerous just like a fire is meant for the fire pit if the Fire gets outside of the fire pit onto the carpet it's messy and dangerous burns the whole house down it's just like water in the ocean is meant to stay in the ocean but when a hurricane comes and water leaves the ocean it's messy and dangerous tearing up houses and cities cars were designed to drive on the road not sidewalks when a car starts to drive on a sidewalk it's going to hit people and it's going to cause casualties sex is meant for marriage it gets messy and dangerous outside of marriage because God didn't create it for that First Corinthians 6 18 it says flee from sexual immorality and all other sins a person commits are outside the body but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body listen you don't flee because sex is bad you flee because God's way is best sex is a wonderful gift but it's best in a marriage relationship well Pastor how far can I go without having sex that's the wrong question the Bible says flee so you don't fall people fall into having sex because they don't flee listen if you don't want to fall don't dance where it's wet if you don't want to fall don't dance where it's wet let me give you the Fourth Way of the World the Fourth Way of the world is for you to overlook the warning signs the world's way will have you ignoring the warning signs the red flags God's way will have you paying attention because it's too big of a choice this is about marriage and who wants to spend the rest of my life with you'll be looking for the fruit of the spirit or the lack thereof listen don't overlook the warning signs look for the double red flags come on you you got somebody they describe all their ex relationships as crazy uh they might be the crazy one all right double red flags they're controlling always want to know where you are demanding to check your texts and email and social media double red flags they want you to cut ties with all your friends and all your family they constantly are talking bad about others double red flags all they care about is money and possessions they don't attend church they don't tithe double red flags they constantly talk about themselves always manipulating you they avoid talking about the problems double red flags they tell you they love of you after the second date double red flags they're always trying to change you they're physically or emotionally dominating you their relationship with God is optional double red flags come on don't ignore the double red flags and so now I want to give you four ways of the word the word of God God's word let's look at how to make dating work better from the word number one is this have a dating plan if you want to do dating the words way get a plan you can't succeed without a dating plan Psalms 20 verse 4 it says may he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed so listen you got a plan for when you'll start dating parents help your teenage help them have a plan how old 16 18 have a plan is it after college when you break up man let's wait six months before you start dating again have a plan plan for who you will date what are the qualities you're looking for what are The Godly Christian quotes what's what's the fruit that you're looking for and put it on a list don't compromise you don't have to settle come on write them out there have a standard plan who you will date plan for how you will date have a plan that we're going to date in group settings plan where you're going to go we're going to be in public places all right ain't no reason to be in the park after dark well you can't say nothing my I think they even got like time limits you're supposed to be gone go home go to the park during the day but you gotta have a plan after you will not be coming into my apartment after this date or any other date not unless my roommate's there you know what I mean you know I just gotta have a play and you gotta have a plan plan for how you will date and you got a plan for the physical listen if you don't want to fall don't dance where it's wet don't ever get to that place where your mind is telling you no but your body your body it's too late it's too late if you let it get there you better have a plan so you will never get there go slow no I'm not kissing you on the first second third fourth or fifth date no we're gonna hold you on my finger we're gonna start off and we're gonna hold hands we're gonna go really slowly you gotta go you gotta go so you gotta have a plan look with Song of Solomon 2 7 says it says promise me o woman of Jerusalem by the gazelles and wild deer not to awaken love until the time is right listen God created you with these hormones and with these feelings and he wants you to enjoy the amazing gift of sex when you're married but before you're married God's word says don't awaken love until the time is right don't awaken love until the time is right you don't want to do the things that are going to lead to the feeling stirring up for those desires before the time is right remember the enemy has a plan for your relationships but so does God follow God's way follow the words way there's the world's way and the words way let's follow the words way and listen if you've been having sex I want you to know that God is a gracious and forgiving God I know this firsthand and it's not too late to start over it's not too late you can stop now you can choose from this day forward to recommit your purity to the Lord to wait until you're married to ask for God's forgiveness have a plan and wait I promise it'll bless you number two second way of the word is go slow and get to know Matthew chapter 7 verse 16 through 20 it says by their fruit you will recognize them do people pick grapes from Thorn bushes or figs from thistles likewise every good tree Bears good fruit but a bad tree Bears Bad fruit a good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire thus buy their fruit you will recognize them listen you need to get to know the person and recognize the fruit that's on their tree go slow and get to know let me give you a couple areas number one get to know the person listen everybody put puts up their best behavior on on the first you know what I mean at first everybody puts on their their best behavior trying to make that great first impression so you have to go slow and really get to know you don't really know someone if you haven't seen them angry frustrated scared if you don't know what makes them happy angry and frustrated you don't know them if you don't know their strengths and weaknesses you don't know them if you don't know their fears and securities and baggage you don't know them go slow and get to know secondly get to know their friends you know smoothly just kind of interview them and ask questions show me their friends and I'll show you their future and if their friends are fools then they will be a fool Proverbs 13 20 walk with the wise and become wise for a companion of fools suffers harm get to know their family is their family full of drama do they get along with their family how do they talk about or to their family how do they treat their family are they rude hateful mean disrespectful or are they loving kind nice and respectful because the only reason we date is to get married is to become a family and how they treat their family is going to be very similar to probably how they're going to treat you when they become your family get to know their money management now not the first date that's weird you know what I mean like yeah give it a little bit of time okay but as you're dating over time get to know how much debt they have how much in the bank account what's their credit score go slow hey I'm trying to help y'all go slow and get to know but Pastor I'm getting old slow but Pastor he's got money slow but Pastor she's fine slow but Pastor any more good ones out there slow Pastor I really think this is the one for me slow Pastor we've been dating a whole two months slow but Pastor I love this person slow go slow and get to know number three the Third Way of the word focus on becoming the right person not finding the right person focus on becoming the right person not finding the right person look back at Romans 12 2 don't copy the behavior and customs of this world but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know God's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect if you allow God to transform your thinking in your life you will find God's will listen if you're becoming the right person you will attract the right person if you will make your greatest Focus to become the right person God will help you find the right person and so become the best you grow in the fruit of the spirit grow in your faith in your relationship with God man read that word be in church read your Bible let God deal and help you with all your baggage so you're not bringing it all into a relationship and setting up your future spouse for failure because they can't deal let God deal with focus on becoming the right person and then Number Four The Fourth Way of the word is surround yourself with wise people listen dating is something too important to do all by yourself it's too important because when you start dating you're going to start becoming like the person you're dating thinking like they think influenced by their values you're going to start giving them some of your emotions and heart you're going to give them your time and energy and ultimately one of the people you date is going to be someone you marry and spend the rest of your life with dating is too important to do all by yourself Proverbs 15 22 it says plans fail for lack of counsel but with many advisors they succeed see you can have a dating plan and it's still not work because you didn't seek wise counsel you need wise people speaking into your life you need them giving their perspective and wisdom on the person you're dating or that you're thinking about dating teenagers young adults get your parents wisdom and listen if your parents aren't certain Lord then find a Godly couple and get their wisdom listen to it lean and listen you gotta seek wisdom it is too dangerous to do dating alone you got to get wisdom from people and it will save you it'll save you from so much pain [Music] there's the world's way and there's the words way come on let's live out the word here's what I can promise you you will never ever ever ever go wrong doing things God's way you'll never go wrong you'll never go wrong following the word of God following his way
4mu_MNPpXnc,well today the title of my message is we are a place where it's all about more changed lives we are a place where it's all about more changed lives my daughter callie uh has been uh diligently saving up money to buy a little motor scooter and so it's like a it's like a mini moped but for like a 10 or 11 year old and so she's been saving it up finally has enough money and she buys it and she every time we get home she's got to hop on it and just drive it around and we've explained to her hey callie you know when you drive it just make sure you stay right around the house don't go past this house we got a little cul-de-sac over here you can drive it around there and so she's always driving uh her little motor scooter around and two weeks ago um we needed cali to come in i think we had somewhere we needed to go and um i'm looking for and i can't find her in the house and i go and look in the garage and sure enough the motor scooter uh is is is gone i'm like she's off on her scooter which she does many times and so normally i just pop out the house cali you know and i'm looking around i'm looking down the street so i'm looking at her boundaries where she normally is and i'm not seeing her everywhere normally i see her maybe you know pop out and driving and i'm looking and i'm callie callie and i'm like she left the boundaries so i'm waiting i'm waiting hoping to see her nothing so i'm like all right so i get in my car now i'm frustrated right you ever been there you're just frustrated you gave boundaries so i'm she's driving around so i'm driving around the neighborhood and i'm frustrated and i'm you know drive to the neighborhood park she's not there i'm like maybe she went to some of her other friend's house driving to her other friend didn't find her there i'm like she is joyriding around this entire so i'm driving around this whole neighborhood but i can't find cali and at this point my frustration has now turned into fear and worry and i'm like somebody has snatched my daughter oh i'm about to tear this neighborhood up kelly i'm driving around i'm looking i'm about to start knocking on every door i'm like lord jesus i pray nobody took my daughter frustration has turned to fear and i'm driving around and i'm looking and i'm just trying i'm just looking for this purple motor scooter like where is cali yeah i'm about to start putting it on social media lord pray do i need to call 9-1-1 and right before i do that i'm like you know what let me let me just text her friend i know her scooter wasn't outside of her house their house but let me just shoot a text and so i texted dad i'm like hey is kelly at your house by chance oh yeah she's here i'm like oh my goodness she was literally across the street but see what had happened was when she drove to their house their garage was open and cali just parks her scooter in people's garages like his her garage well the dad didn't realize that he closed the garage and so i'm driving around looking for a scooter can not find it everywhere but hey y'all about to turn that neighborhood inside out to find my daughter because i love her and i care for her and today we're going to look at a parable that jesus told about someone who lost something of value let's look at luke chapter 15 verse 8-10 it says or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one does she not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it and when she finds it she calls her friends and neighbors together and says rejoice with me i have found my lost coin in the same way i tell you there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents and jesus tells a parable in luke 15 actually tells three of them about three different things that are lost the verse is right before the lost coin he tells the parable of the lost sheep and then after the parable of the lost coin he tells the parable of the the prodigal son a story of the lost son and what jesus was doing is he was driving home the point that god is more focused on lost people than he is found people that the priority of heaven is always to reach one more person who is far from god heaven is always about the one who is still lost and heaven's priority should be earth's priority and at people's church we always want heaven's priority to be our priority god has called us to reach people who are far from god and as long as there is one person that needs to experience new life in christ we will do everything we can to reach one more that's why we started people's church 20 years ago because it's all about more changed lives come on everybody shout more changed lives it's all about more changed lives and i want to give you three things we must do the next 20 years to see more changed lives three things we must do the next 20 years to see more change lives the first is this is we must care about the one we must care about the one one of the most important messages in all three parables is how each person cared deeply about what was lost the shepherd he cared deeply about the lost sheep he left the 99 to go find the one the father he cared deeply when he saw his son coming back at a distance he ran to him and gave him a hug the lady cared deeply about the lost coin and in the story of the lost coin she cared so much that she lit a lamp to search for the lost coin see we have to care enough to turn on the lamp in dark places the bible says in matthew 5 14 that we are the light of the world and people who care about the lost don't hide their light people who care about the lost they let their light shine in dark places in people's church god has called us to turn on the light everywhere we go turn on the light no matter how dark it is turn on the light at your home turn on the light at your job turn on the light at your school turn on the light with your crazy family turn on the light at the ball game turn on the light at the grocery store turn on the light every sunday and wednesday at church turn on the light and if we aren't careful we can stop letting our light shine we start turning off the light instead of turning on the light here's how we turn off our light when christ followers become complacent we turn off the light when we become so desensitized by all the sin and the wickedness and the chaos we start thinking it's pointless to let my lights i mean my what difference my light can't make a difference at all and i'm here to say no that is not the truth your light can make a difference and you need to turn your light on some christ followers they turn off their light because they spend their time whining instead of shining start complaining about the darkness being critical about the darkness condemning about the darkness come start complaining about how messed up this world is and all this darkness and it's messing with me and messing with my family and messing with our world oh my goodness look at all this this darkness and this mess is messing with my finances it's messing with it's just all this darkness and just everybody the world is wicked and all these wicked people they just it's going to hell and folks start sounding like the pharisees luke chapter 15 verse one and two which is now the tax collectors and sinners we're all gathering around to hear jesus but the pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered this man welcomes sinners and eats with them ugh can't even believe he's having company with those sharing food uh what is he doing what what oh man i can't believe muttering complaining being critical luke 19 verse 6-7 it says so he came down at once and welcomed him gladly this was speaking of zacchaeus another sinner and all the people saw this and began to mutter he has gone to be a guest of this oh i can only imagine what they're doing in that house what is going on you see where jesus went you better be careful that darkness is going to get him and we're complaining critical luke chapter 5 verse 29 and 30 it says then levi had a great banquet for jesus at his house in a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them but the pharisees and teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners see the pharisees talked about lost people like they were some kind of creature oh jesus is hanging around with those sinners like they're not even people or human beings see when our hearts are filled with condemnation we forget that those sinners are people that god loves we forget that those sinners are somebody's son daughter brother sister husband or wife we forget that we used to be those sinners come on we forget the only reason that we are no longer those sinners is not because of anything we did but because of what jesus did and the pharisees hearts are so filled with condemnation but jesus he was focused on caring for people that are far from god don't spend your time condemning spend your time caring and turn on the light turn on the light let your light shine in the dark places let your love and your kindness let your smile shine let your serve shine let your compassion your hope your generosity and your patience shine in the dark places god give us a heart that cares about the one that cares about those that are lost god help us turn the light on to be light of the world and never turn it off to reach the one we must care for the one number two we must be committed to going after the one we must be committed to going after the one in luke 15 the shepherd went after the lost sheep the father ran to the lost son while he was a long way off the lady searched for the lost coin it says she lit the lamp and she grabbed the broom she lit the lamp and she grabbed the broom listen here at people's church we are a broom grabbing church come on we are searching and we are going after the law we are a broom-grabbing church we are going after the one we aren't just sitting back or sitting around talking about reaching the one we are going after the one that's why we do outreaches so we can reach the one that's why we do easter land and wild world have free food and carnival rides and face painting and petting zoos to reach the one that's why we do giveaways and free donuts and friends days and specialty coffee to reach the one cookouts to reach the ones why we're going back to the movies starting on may 29th through the whole month of june to reach one more that's why we give hundreds and thousands of dollars every year to local missions national missions and overseas missions so that we can reach one more person with the good news of jesus we are committed to doing everything we can to reach as many people as possible we're sweeping we're turning on the light and we're we're sweeping i love how the apostle paul says it in first corinthians chapter 9 verse 22 and 23 it says to the weak i became weak to win the week i have become all things to all people so that by all possible means i might save some i do all this for the sake of the gospel that i might share in its blessing we become all things to all people so that we might save some come on you got to get your broom and start searching for the lost and hurting and broken people in our world but here's what can happen we can get fired up by pastor i'm ready

we must celebrate the one who was found luke chapter 15 verse five and six it says that when he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says rejoice with me i found my lost sheep and luke 15 9-10 it says and when she finds it she calls her friends and neighbors together and says rejoice with me she went house to house i found my lost coin in the same way i tell you there is rejoicing in the presence of angels of god over one sinner who repents in luke 15 23 24 the father throws a huge party and celebrates his lost son coming home see luke 15 7 says there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous person who do not need to repent heaven rejoices over every changed life it's

YqkKpqE8iJM,well today uh the title of my message is I don't recognize Jesus my dad uh he is uh single and he's still looking for that special someone and so like many folks he uses the online uh dating sites you know where you you know you put your picture and you put a little bio and you know I guess the way it works is maybe you give a wink to somebody or you heart their profile or you swipe right or left or up or down or you just you know message somebody you know hey how you doing you know and if they respond back and so he's on this uh uh site and he sees a lady that catches his eye and so he you know I think he messaged her and they started messaging back and forth and having conversation and kind of hit a point where they're like yeah we'd like to you know go on a date and and meet each other face to face and so uh they agree to to to meet up at a coffee coffee shop and so you know I guess when you do this and you go to the coffee shop you got to pull up the picture right you know just to to make sure the the person's there and and they match and so he pulls out his phone and he's looking at the picture and he's looking around the coffee shop and there's people here but he's not seeing the ladies so you know he takes a seed you know I guess she was being fashionably late you know and so he takes a seed and when he takes a seat a lady that was sitting comes up to him and she's like hi David and he he's like hi do I know you and we'll just call her Julie right we don't know if that's really that's not her real name we'll just call her Julie and she's like it's me Julie he like this is not you oh that picture is just a little outdated oh how can be you know what I mean he's I couldn't even recognize you looking at the picture this is not you I'm thinking you is u l y you ain't got no alibi you ugly he didn't say that he did not say that but he did end the date right then and there he's like I'll see you later and so got to be careful out on them online dating streets but didn't even recognize her and you know we don't always recognize people we can be in their presence and still not recognize them and what I've learned in 25 years of preaching and 16 years of being a pastor at People's Church is people don't always recognize Jesus people can be in the presence of Jesus and still not recognize Jesus and after the resurrection of Jesus Christ there's a story in the Bible where a woman was in the presence of Jesus but didn't recognize him read with me John 20: 11-4 it says now Mary stood outside the tomb crying crying as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white seated where Jesus's body had been one at the head and the other at the foot they asked Heroman why are you crying they have taken my Lord away she said and I don't know where they have put them at this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there but she did not realize that it was Jesus maybe you can relate to Mary you went to church camp as a kid or teenager but you never recognized Jesus you grew up going to Sunday school or Sunday services but you don't recognize Jesus you heard preachers talk about Jesus but you never recognize Jesus for yourself You' sung worship songs and read by Bible verses but you don't recognize Jesus how can people hear about Jesus sing about Jesus be in the presence of Jesus and Miss sing Jesus today I want to share with you three obstacles that cause people to miss Jesus we're going to learn from Mary in this story three obstacles that cause people to Miss Jesus the first obstacle is this your emotions can cause you to miss Jesus John 20113 they asked Heroman why are you crying they have taken my Lord away she said and I don't know where they have put him Mary didn't recognize Jesus because she was clouded by her emotions and if you think about it she had a right to be emotional I mean she just witnessed the horrific death the crucifixion of Jesus she witnessed him breathe his last breath she is mourning she is weeping and then she goes to the tomb to see that the to the stone has been rolled away and his body is missing and she is just an emotional wreck she is overcome with emotion and she is crying Mary was looking for death at that tomb and her tears blinded her from seeing life at the tomb she was overwhelmed with mourning and she missed the fact that she should have been rejoicing her feelings were drowning out the facts that Jesus was alive and just like Mary today there are many people who are so overwhelmed with emotions that they can't recognize Jesus and maybe that's where you find yourself this Easter weekend your past pain has blinded you from seeing Jesus you've been so focused on your anxiety and you're missing Jesus you're so consumed with feelings of hopelessness and depression worry grief anger loneliness and bitterness and you're missing Jesus Jesus is close by but you're so overwhelmed with emotions that you don't recognize him the second obstacle is this your disappointment can cause you to miss Jesus John 2015 he asked her woman why are you crying who is it you looking for thinking he was the gardener this is now Jesus talking to her she said sir if you carried him away tell me where you have put him and I will get him see Mary arrived at the tomb and she expected the tomb to be closed and for Jesus to be behind the stone but Jesus wasn't there she was disappointed because she didn't understand the plan of God Jesus was alive but she had the wrong expectation and some of you can't recognize Jesus because you have a wrong expect ation that is leading to disappointment and disappointment can hinder you from seeing Jesus you're disappointed about the death of a loved one if God is real why did they die so young you're disappointed about your children and where they are in life if God was at work on Earth your kids would be doing better they would be making better choices you're disappointed because you can't get pregnant you're disappointed about your marriage problems you're disappointment because you got fired from your job and you're like why would God allow this to happen you're disappointed because you thought you'd be married by now you're disappointed about the horrible doctor's report you have cancer you have some rare disease you've been diagnosed with a terrible illness where is God why won't won he heal me you're disappointed because you never expected to be where you are in life you thought God had a plan and a purpose for your life but nothing is working out for you next Sunday I'm I'm I'm beginning a new series it's called stay in your lane preparing for your purpose listen every one of you was created on purpose and for a purpose and next week you don't want to miss this series I'm going to teach you how to live out your god-given purpose God has a purpose for your life some of you are disappointed because it doesn't look like God is answering any of your prayers you've prayed and prayed and prayed for God to work in a situation and nothing has changed matter of fact things seem to be getting worse and just like Mary disappointment can cause you to miss seeing Jesus you can miss the love of God because of your disappointment you can miss the kindness of God you can miss recognizing the grace and mercy of God you can miss recognizing all the the blessings that God has poured out in your life disappointment causes so many people to miss Jesus and the third obstacle is your confusion can cause you to miss Jesus your confusion can cause you to miss Jesus Not only was Mary overwhelmed with emotions but she was confused Mary said in John 20115 sir if you've carried him away tell me where you have put him and I will get him see she had a picture in her mind of where Jesus should have been she was confident that he was dead and his dead body was at the tomb and when Jesus wasn't where she thought he would be and he didn't look like she thought he should look she was confused she said tell me where you have put the image of Jesus I'm looking for and I will get him and today many people are confused about the image of Jesus they're looking for the version of Jesus that they've pictured in their mind is keeping them from the real true Jesus of the bible let me give you some examples people are confused because their version of Jesus wouldn't allow all the horrible suffering in the world Jesus can't be God at least not a good God because there's too much pain suffering murder rape hatred racism greed cheating and genocide but hear me the existence of pain and suffering in our world doesn't mean that there isn't a loving and all powerful God just because you and I don't understand all the ways of God doesn't mean that there isn't a god Ecclesiastes 11:5 it says as you do not know the path of the wind or how the body is formed in a mother's womb so you cannot understand the work of God the maker of all things just because we don't understand everything doesn't mean that there isn't a loving God we can't limit and confine God to our thinking his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts we'll never fully understand the ways of God some people are confused because their version of Jesus wouldn't allow bad things to happen to good people they think if Jesus Is God then bad things shouldn't happen to good people they get confused about Jesus because they think that following Jesus should Shield people from experiencing bad things but that's a wrong picture of Jesus the biblical real Jesus said this in John 16:33 I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart I have overcome the world Jesus told his disciples and followers they would experience trouble in the world because Adam and Eve sinned in the garden way back in the Book of Genesis there's sin suffering pain and evil in our world today we all experience it listen I love Jes Jesus and I follow Jesus but yet I've had a mentor somebody I considered a best friend betray me in ways I would never wish on my worst enemy deeply wounded me I've had people lie on me call me names my family has faced chronic illness and mental illness I've suffered many uh uh panic attacks in life and just because bad things happen to me doesn't mean Jesus isn't real and a good God CS Lewis the the great Theologian he wrote a book you should read called the problem with pain if you struggle with pain in this world and why is this happening and why do bad things happen to good people I would encourage you to read the book The problem with pain some people are confused because they believe a loving Jesus should allow many different ways to get to God they think if God is love then any Rel religion should be okay there should be many paths to God Islam Buddhist Hinduism you know what's interesting about the other religions is that they say Jesus was a good man he was a prophet but I want you to listen I want us to listen to what Jesus said about himself in John 146 Jesus answered I am the way and the truth and and the life no one comes to the father except through me from Jesus's lips Jesus said I'm the only way to God the father as CS Lewis once said Jesus is either a liar a lunatic or Lord and I believe with all my heart he is Lord Jesus is Lord Mary believed that Jesus was Lord let's look back at the story John 2016 Jesus said to her Mary she turned to him and cried out in Aramaic raboni which means teacher Mary realized it was Jesus when he called her by name listen she had a personal Encounter With Jesus that changed everything for her see today what some of you need is not more facts not more books not more convincing arguments about Jesus you need a personal Encounter With Jesus you need to hear Jesus call you by name it changed everything for Mary and it'll change everything for you notice what it says next in John 20:1 17 and 18 Jesus said do not hold onto me for I have not ascended yet to I have not yet ascended to the father go instead to my brother and tell them I am ascending to my father and your father to my God and your God Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news I have seen the Lord and she told them that he had said these things to her Mary said I have seen the Lord Jesus called her by name she had a personal encounter with the Lord what changed everything for me I had a personal encounter for the Lord I didn't understand at all it didn't make sense but I had an an unquestionable encounter with the Lord you can't argue with me or convince me that Jesus is is not Lord because I've had a personal Encounter With Jesus a person with an experience with God is never at the mercy of a person with an argument I've experience the Lord for myself I heard him call my name it happened when I was 18 years old on a Wednesday night sitting in the youth service on the very back row I was lost I was broken I was I was I had anger issues I was looking for love and all the wrong places I was partying I was getting drunk I was looking for the meaning of life and yet all that stuff the partying and the lying and all of that it was just leading to more pain and hurt but on that Wednesday night I met Jesus and Jesus changed my life I'll never forget experiencing his love I'll never forget that he called me by name I'll never forget my personal encounter with the Lord and my prayer today as you hear some testimonies of people that have had their own personal experience with Jesus is that you would have your own experience with the Lord I was already divorced I wasn't able to see my kids I just came out of the military my father and my sister killed by a drunk driver and I think I just went from one drug to the next trying to feel the hole that I had in me for me being far from God uh was being addicted my wife caught me yeah the low point was breaking her heart and hating myself for it I ran away from God for a long time um and I think that was because of the hurt and the trauma it was dark it was depressive I had a lot of anxiety I was going out drinking um I was just trying to find relationships I would say that would validate me that's what I was always in search for with that came a lot of hurt a lot of Shame a lot of guilt I had just been dumped from a 4-year relationship I'm holding a 40 caliber pistol in my hands thinking that I'm ready to check out I was in the street i' been up for days and I ran into this little blue-haired lady she asked me if I was hungry we had my arm we started walking we were walking toward a church I had blame God for all the wrong things that had happened to me and I tried to pull away and she just held onto my arm tight and she says don't worry about it we don't have to talk about Jesus just come get something to eat on the hill of My Savior BL Me by Jesus s me free look at the wounds that give me life Grace flowing from his oh great sacri we visited People's Church Midwest City like I get emotional now but I felt like I belong some where one of my best friends she invited

q0HFjC5SAzE,well today we are continuing our series I wish I would have and this series is designed every teaching to help you have less regrets fewer regrets in 2023 and so much regret in life happens because we've never received training in two very important areas of Our Lives you can graduate from high school and even from college and never have one class on how to have healthy relationships you can become an adult and never have receive training on how to be a good son or daughter how to be a good spouse employee boss leader or manager most of us were never taught how to have healthy relationships most people also become adults and never learn the best practices on how to handle money they never learned how to save how to spend how to establish good credit how to purchase a home or a car how to how the stock market worse it works investing for retirement when I graduated college I knew how to work a credit card oh yeah I was working at Babel Visa Mastercard oh we were good friends I knew how that worked uh what I didn't know was about all the interest and how that piles up and I didn't know nothing about retirement savings or stocks and invest I didn't have a clue think about it you can earn your doctor's degree no football plays know how to shoot a basketball how to play a 2-3 zone defense you can learn how to be a cheerleader and do back flips and play an instrument and be an actor in a school play and not have a clue on have the best practices of how to resolve human conflict and financial management and so because of this we have a lot of I wish I would have when it comes to relationships and money after Easter we're going to spend several weeks talking about how to make relationships work today I want to give you an overview of how to make money work I've titled my message I wish I would have had less Financial stress I wish I would have had less Financial stress now listen this is not a generosity message okay this is a message to help you have fewer regrets when it comes to handling your money which you do every day all right so you can just loosen up a little bit relax I really want to help you because I love you and I want to help you win in your finances so here's my first point today I wish I would have avoided stuffitis I wish I would have avoided stuffitis I had a bad case of stuffitis in my early 20s staphidis is when you have the wrong relationship with stuff and money did you realize that a wrong relationship with money will mess up your life the Bible talks about this in first Timothy chapter six Paul first gives us the right relationship with money and then he tells us what happens when we have a wrong relationship with money check this out first Timothy chapter 6 verse 6 through 10. it says but godliness with contentment is great gain for we were brought for we brought nothing into the world and we will we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with that that's the right relationship and now he gives us the wrong relationship look at verse 9's verse 9 it says those who want to get rich those they're never content they think having more and more will make them happy they spend their life chasing more the Bible says they fall into temptation and they trap and into many foolish and harmful desires desires of greed jealousy discontentment desires of compromising their morals and values it says that plunge people into ruin and destruction a wrong relationship with money ruins marriages it ruins people from being good parents it ruins friendships and family relationships it ruins emotional mental and physical health verse 10 says For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil listen there's nothing wrong with having money there's nothing wrong with being a millionaire or a billionaire I hope God raises up many of them at people's church so that we can take the gospel around the world and start more locations and invest into the Next Generation and into our Leadership College but there is a massive problem when you love money and stuff when you love money and stuff it can wreck everything in your life it goes on to say some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs people have wandered away from the faith because of money and stuff they thought that the pursuit of money and stuff was the answer but it actually had the opposite effect it only caused more grief more pain and more trouble a wrong relationship with money will mess up so many areas of your life and Jamie and I we learned this first hand because of a wrong relationship with money 20 years ago I was using money we didn't have to purchase stuff we didn't need while we're engaged I bought a newer car and entered into our marriage with card debt Jamie had student loan debt we then wanted to go on vacation so we got the credit cards that get you the miles and we're like okay we're going to get these so we'll get all the miles for all the things we purchased we'll actually purchase the vacation on the credit card so we can get miles for all those dollars so we can go on future vacations and we weren't paying off any of these credit cards we had a problem instead of going to a garage sale to buy some cheap furniture we brought it we bought it brand new on credit leather couches had cup holders in them had the little you know the legs go out but it was like electronic you know what I mean oh yeah got our new couches on credit even though we could not afford it my mom is a garage sale Queen and it just always sounded like torture like why do you want to go to a house after a house after a house but hey y'all I'm 42 I understand my mom now listen bring on the garage sale if it will bring Financial Peace okay hello Facebook Marketplace if it if it'll bring a little Financial Peace I get it now we could have waited to get cable with every channel in the NFL Sunday Ticket it would have been inconvenient but we could have made it without it but I had to have it right now so we paid for it monthly on our credit card that we weren't paying off and then because of the financial pressure the credit card got maxed out well what are we gonna do for emergencies I mean if an emergency goes so we got another credit card this one had points for hotels oh here we go so then we have an emergency that's going to help us go y'all we had a problem y'all I was the one with the problem I had a wrong relationship with stuff I was violating biblical principles because I had to have it now I couldn't wait until we could afford it I was in love with having it now and the first thing Jamie and I had to do was develop a deep conviction that enough was enough matter of fact I'll never forget sitting at a Chili's in Oklahoma City and I look up at Jamie and I said this is probably the last date night we're going to be able to have Chili's and she's like what do you mean and I started going over all of the debt that we had in the interest rates we were completely upside down in that moment and that night we said enough is enough we gotta change we can't keep going on this path we had to kill this disease before it ship wrecked our future and so one day in our late 20s we decided no more enough is enough we are going to keep living like this we are not going to keep spending money that we don't have we are not going to keep getting in more debt we are not going to keep putting ourselves under more and more Financial stress here's what I've learned to have fewer Financial regrets it begins with a conviction that enough is enough no more in first Timothy 6 11 it says but you men of God flee from all of this see deciding to flee isn't about having all of the right knowledge and principles it's not about reading more books and listening to more podcasts it's about having a conviction that enough is enough fewer Financial regrets begins with a conviction I'm tired of this financial pressure I'm tired of spending more than I make I'm tired of all this debt I'm tired of getting raises and bonuses and still being broke fleeing is all about your convictions you can have all the right knowledge but you won't do anything with it if you don't have a conviction in your heart that enough is enough and so today my prayer is that you decide you're going to flee that you decide enough is enough that you're going to change that from this day forward you're going to live with fewer Financial regrets and after you develop a conviction to flee then you have to take the next step and that's to pursue First Timothy 6 11 but you man of God flee from all of this and pursue righteousness godliness Faith love endurance and gentleness to defeat the disease of stuffitis you can't just flee you also have to pursue the right things you have to pursue righteousness godliness Faith love endurance and gentleness in the context of today's message let me say it like this you have to pursue biblical stewardship I want to quickly give you six write Pursuits to fewer Financial regrets six right Pursuits to fewer Financial regrets the first is this pursue tracking your spending our conviction to live with fewer Financial regrets must lead us to put together a plan Proverbs 21 5 it says good planning and hard work lead to Prosperity but Hasty shortcuts lead to Poverty see a goal without a plan is a wish and failure to plan is planning to fail you have to have a plan to find out where your money is going you don't want to continue to wonder where it went you want to remove the mystery and so here's what I want you to do for the next 30 days for the next 30 days track your spending every dollar you spend for the next third literally write down every expense and track it on your phone and keep track of your spending Jamie and I we have tracked all of our receipts for years and we still are tracking our spending it will shock you where you are spending your money when you start to track how much you spend on eating out coffee the golf course shoes Nails clothes shoot you just check groceries right now like you just it will just start to shock you like oh my goodness you know what I mean like all of a sudden you're like we're spending what so just for third that's what happened when all of a sudden we dove in we're like oh Lord yet no more chilies number two pursue planning your spending good planning doesn't just involve tracking your spending it also involves planning your spending look what Proverbs 27 23 says it says riches can disappear fast and the king's crown doesn't stay in his family forever so watch your business interests closely know the state of your flocks and your herds listen money disappears quickly and so we have to watch our money closely one of the best things that Jamie and I have done with our money is to tell it where to go well we've created budget categories and we tell our money where to go success doesn't just happen it's plan for and so let me show you our budget categories and so these are all of our budget categories and let me be very clear it always starts with the tithe we're not we're not stealing from God we're not robbing God and so our the top of our budget category is our tithe and then we budget what we give over and above our ties and we budget what we give to our to our to our Miracle offering and then we come on you gotta but not going to steal from the government either we got budget our our taxes because we're not going to be able to spend those dollars in tax service and then we budget for our savings and then our housing and then life insurance for the kids and me and Jamie are our sewer storm water and trash our Netflix our Amazon Prime our gas water electricity we got our car insurance cell phone Cohen preschool we got a hey hey he's about to be out of preschool it's about to be going preschool and Jesus we about to get a raise y'all but right now it's Cohen preschool and we got a budget for that every month we got our kids lunch internet and TV gym membership groceries family Nate day mad money but whatever I can't remember where we got that phrase from somebody gave us to it but mad money is dollars that we budget that me and Jamie can spend however we want and however if I just want to spend it all on coffee I spend it all on coffee and that's typically what I do but it's it's my mad money and we budget it we budgeted and Jamie has hers and then gas and car maintenance Home Supply we budget for Christmas all right haircuts credentials School Bill supplies car tags and then peanut did I had to put dog there because y'all might have been like man they really like peanuts and I don't want anybody buying me bags of peanuts I don't love them that much it's our dog I mean I know Dogs cost money and you got a budget for that dude and so on and so forth and so we tell our money where it's going this is our 2023 and every year we we do this and so you got to have a plan you got to have a plan and listen we want to help you because I'm gonna go through these points quickly next Sunday uh the next two Sundays we're gonna do a free financial class at 9 30 a.m in our growth track room it's completely free these topics are going to be dove into a deeper level where you can start to make a plan and make a budget and start to plan how to get out of debt and plan how to save and all of that and so listen would you make that part of your plan come on pull out your phone put on your calendar next Sunday March 5th and March 12th at 9 30 a.m in the growth track room attend our free financial class so that you'll have less regrets when it comes to your finances make this a part of your plan all right success doesn't just happen it is planned for number three pursue attacking your debt Proverbs 21 5. it says good planning and hard work lead to prosperity but Hasty shortcuts lead to Poverty to live with fewer Financial regrets it will require hard work there are no shortcuts it's not easy to have fewer Financial regret but it's very possible with some hard work see it's hard to live upside down financially and to live with the stress and pressure and it's also hard to get your finances under control and live with financial peace peace both ways are hard but there's a right heart and a wrong heart and you get to choose your heart I never forgot when Jamie and I we we chose our heart we are going we are going to get debt free we're going to do whatever it takes however long it takes to get debt free and at that point in time with a lot of credit card debt another debt I think we had over 18 000 worth of debt that all had interest on it and so we started to apply the debt snowball method uh from from Dave Ramsey and so basically that method is you take your your smallest debt you know so let's say our smallest was a credit card that had two thousand dollars on it okay and and so all our other debt we still made our minimum payments but any extra money we had we put it all towards that 2000 to get that two thousand dollars paid for I know somebody said you're like hold up aren't you shouldn't you be attacking the debt with the highest interest Pastor your math don't listen math wasn't our problem y'all it was discipline it was lack of we needed some wins in our belt okay we just needed to see one of them credit cards go away and so we took the the minimum payment and everything extra towards that two thousand dollar credit card and we paid that off and then once that got paid off that extra money we had we went on vacation no I'm just playing we did not do that that extra money we had we then took it to the next smallest debt and everything we had extra we got that tax return no we didn't go party we put it towards the debt all right we're gonna pay now so we can play later and so on and so forth and it took us a little over three years but over three years we were able to wipe out all of that debt you got to pursue attacking your debt number four pursue saving your money pursue saving your money you need a conviction that enough is enough you need a good plan and tracking for your spending you need a plan to tell your money where to go you need to attack your debt and you need to save listen saving your money is hard work it takes good planning and hard work to have financial prosperity it's hard work but listen you can do it you can do it Proverbs 21 20 it says the wise have a wealth and luxury but fools spend whatever they get throughout the Book of Proverbs it Compares wise people versus foolish people and I want you to notice the difference between the wise and foolish person has nothing to do with how much they earn they are wise they are wise and foolish people who earn 20K a year or 50k or 100K or 250k or Millions a year wise and foolish people aren't wise based off how much they make their wise base based on how much they save a year no matter how much money you make if you spend it all you're a fool hold up Pastor you calling me a fool I am not calling you a fool the Bible did this means the wise live within their means and don't overextend themselves they have savings but the foolish person no matter how much they make they spend every penny of it and then some it's wisdom to have savings and it's foolish to spend all you earn I want to quickly share with you about creating savings so that you can live with fewer regrets first thing if you want to write this down save for emergencies Begin by saving a thousand dollars as an emergency fund come on emergencies happen car breaks down medical expenses appliances do whatever it takes to get a thousand dollars set aside legally and biblically all right so some of y'all need to hear that do whatever it takes to get a thousand dollars on the side legally and biblically all right now let me give you some ideas on how to get an a thousand dollar emergency fund here's one eat at home and take your lunch to work the average family spends two hundred dollars a month eating out make coffee at home the average person spends a hundred and twenty eight dollars a month on coffee I may be guilty of that from time to time but I've made changes made some changes number three shop your car and home insurance I just did this every other year I'll I'll do it some of you may have been with the same place and not even realize that your rates have gone up I mean shop it around see if you can't get the same coverage for for for for for less money so shot and you can shop other things around I've shopped cable around you know hey time I had to cut the cable but I I've shopped cable around I've I've shopped phone cell phone service home phone service I've shopped internet you ever been there like all of a sudden you could be tracking your money you're like how why am I spending eighty dollars on internet I thought I had the Forty dollar plan yeah that ran out like six months ago and you weren't tracking your ex you know what I mean and so hey hey I will call somebody with the quickness and yep I'll be on hold for two hours and I'll talk to ten different people you know what I mean but I will hey we're gonna get this down to 40. no see you be a buy who got a deal who got a deal oh I've changed internet companies many times I've changed cell phone companies for a season get rid of cable TV Netflix Hulu Disney plus we've done that get a cheaper car the average American spends 564 dollars a month on a car payment get a cheaper and reliable car for less money hold up have you passed you want me I just got this nice new beautiful car I know it's a 500 something you really yes I do would you do it I've already did I did when we were in Oklahoma City we've got a brand new Pathfinder oh yeah we were bumping y'all yeah 490 payment a month I remember Pastor herb been like oh nice car do you pay cash for that uh no oh okay he didn't say nothing else he just walked right on I think two weeks later he preached about money and Jamie love that Pathfinder she got a tear in her eyes somewhere here in the building right now I said babe we got to sell back that Pathfinder and we did we sold it back we got an older Honda Accord still reliable and we dropped it we went from a 490 a month payment to a 170. now we still had a payment because we couldn't pay cash at that time but we at least got it knocked down so that we can start knocking off debt and eventually we knocked off the debt on that car as well listen you can do it okay listen work to get to getting three to six months of savings for a major emergency now some Financial experts would tell you to get all your debt paid off except for your house before you get three to six months of savings and this is typically sound advice but everyone's financial situation is a little different get a life insurance policy to help your family out just in case the ultimate emergency happens so save for emergencies save for your future retirement save for future purchases Jamie and I budget so that we have margin so that every month we're putting into our retirement and we are putting into our savings we also write out our budget so we are saving now we will never have another car loan we will buy the car when we have cash for the car we will buy the new furniture when we have cash for the new furniture we'll buy the TV when we have money for the TV whatever else we want we're vacations Christmas presents we budget we save all right so you got to save number five number five pursue a generous life pursue a generous life Psalm 37 21. this is the wicked borrow and never repay but The Godly our generous givers see Wicked people borrow with no intentions of ever repaying they're takers but The Godly live in such a way that they create margin in their finances so that they can be generous they are given givers the wicked are takers and The Godly are generous and one of the things Jamie and I have done our entire married life even when we're struggling financially even when we were in debt and trying to get out of debt was we have always been generous to the Lord we have always been tithers we have always tithed it wasn't easy it was a sacrifice but we experience God's Supernatural help because we invited God into our financial mess and as a minimum we always always always tied if you will be generous to God by being a tither you will invite God's power into your financial solution let me give you a goal and I remember years ago when Pastor Herbert mentioned this and I just never thought it would even be possible but let me give you a goal for your finances it's called 10 10 80. okay okay give 10 percent to God save 10 percent live off 80 percent now Jamie and I we have always given ten percent saving 10 we haven't always done that there were times in our lives we were doing ten two in 88 or 10 5 and 85 however you want to do the math but today at a minimum we're able to do 10 10 80. give save live give save live you may think about is that even possible to live off it it is possible you'll have to adjust you'll take hard work it may take years to to get there but you can even get there and Beyond we give actually more we live off of less than 80 percent because we actually now we give more than 10 percent and we save 10 percent and we live off of Left percent less so and we just want to continue to do that listen you can do it give save live and then number six pursue getting started now everybody say pursue now pursue now don't wait get started now listen procrastination stops so many people from having Financial Peace they feel overwhelmed they feel defeated they feel hopeless they feel like things are never going to change so they never get started listen it won't happen overnight okay I'm not going to make you false promises it won't happen overnight there are no shortcuts but church I'm telling you it is possible if you will get started today a year from now two years from now three years from now you can have more peace in your finances than you ever realized possible but you have to get started don't put it off listen you can pay off those credit cards you can pay off your car debt you can get a thousand dollars in an emergency agency fund you can get three to six months into savings you can save for retirement and have five hundred thousand a million two million three million dollars set aside you can be generous and not only tithe but give thousands of dollars away to build God's kingdom you can do this you really can if you'll get started today you can do it there's going to be some pain it's gonna be uncomfortable you're gonna have to sit down and you may have to get help from somebody else and humble yourself and overcome the pride of feeling embarrassed I had to do it I know what it felt like when I sat down with my good friend Josh Brown and showed him how upside down I was but I knew he was a master at budgeting and so I sat down with him and I remember it was embarrassing when he's like man I would sell the Pathfinder and get a cheaper car Kristen I would do this and I would do that I remember and I've had many other people speak into my life somebody never listen to a word they say but the moment that Jamie and I said enough is enough change began to happen and just like I did it you can do it too but you have to get started today a good plan implemented today is better than a perfect plan implemented tomorrow today is the opportunity to build the tomorrow you want

excited about what God's going to do through this series but but today we're wrapping up speed kills and I've titled today's message I've Got Rhythm Oklahoma rhythm y'all know nothing about back in the day you know about breaking dancing you know you don't know nothing about all of that yeah I'm not talking about that kind of Rhythm that's not what the message is about today but I want to talk to you about today is that God set up the Earth to operate in rhythms understand this God set up the Earth to operate in rhythms Genesis chapter 1 verse 14 says then God said let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night let them be signs to Mark the seasons days and years just check it out God set things up to operate in Rhythm day and night Seasons days years rhythms Genesis chapter 8 verse 22 just takes us a little bit deeper that God set up the Earth to operate in rhythms it says in in 822 as long as the Earth endures seed time Harvest rhythms cold and heat summer and winter rhythms day and night will never cease God created the Earth to operate by rhythms by by patterns and a see there's a season to sow and then there's a season to reap a harvest so so my wife and I and our house we have some trees and and our grass in some areas is kind of dying and so we googled and researched and we understand that the best time to plant fescue grass to grow in our yard is in the fall so we've been recently putting out fescue grass because it's the right season it's the right Rhythm to put out the grass so that the seed will take and that the grass will begin to grow God set up the Earth to operate in rhythms there's the rhythm of night and day that there's the rhythm of the Four Seasons The Fallout most of the time I usually come a little later in the fall and the leaves are almost all gone it is just beautiful here in Indianapolis in the fall all these pretty trees it's It's the Rhythm it's the right season if you miss the season the winter will be here those leaves will be gone then there's spring and and there's some there's there's a rhythm there's a pattern that's how God set up the Earth to operate my wife's family is from up North further north and here Minnesota Wisconsin that's where her family is from and and I have been there several times Christmas time seeing family being up north matter of fact one Christmas we were in Wisconsin with her family and I went ice fishing yes your boy from Oklahoma walk to the water oh yes I did I walked on that ice walked on water and went ice fishing and they asked me did I want to go ice fishing anybody have been ice fishing I was scared like what do you mean ice fishing it's below zero out there brother's gonna die this is not the season to go fishing but they had a shack that you could get in and stay warm and go fishing and it was it was an awesome experience I did it once that's it that's it that's all but it was awesome fishing on that ice in the shack and I'm glad they had the shack because if you go fishing in Wisconsin in January February without a shack it's you're gonna hurt yourself it's the wrong season it's it's the wrong it's the wrong Rhythm it's the wrong timing to go fishing outdoors and what I want to teach you today is that a healthy successful life is built and maintained by living with consistent biblical rhythms if you violate the rhythms you hurt your life instead of helping your life I want to give some practical examples out of my own life I want to share with you some of my personal rhythms that have helped my life instead of hurting my life personal rhythms what one of the The rhythms that has kept me on fire for God all of these years is every single day I read my Bible and pray it's just a rhythm it's a it's a pattern it's a it's a habit in my life matter of fact I I like to read you version as well every single day I like to keep my YouVersion streak who else does the YouVersion Street come on lift those hands up I y'all this past week I was up like to 280 something days and I don't know what happened I woke up this past week I was like what I lost my strength is that why how to go back one day I I was trying to cheat I couldn't figure it out but I was trying to figure it out I'm like on day six or seven again my goodness but it's a rhythm it's a rhythm the rhythm of weekly Church like it's made all the difference in my life just weekly having a rhythm of coming to church a weekly date night with my wife it's a every Thursday night is our it's our date night it's a it's a rhythm that has helped our marriage immensely matter of fact there was a season we didn't like each other and we got out of that season because we just kept dating going on dates crying arguing don't like each other but I mean that Rhythm got us out of that season we were in because we just had it we had a we had a rhythm where we have we had a we have a weekly family date night on Friday nights and our kids are all teenagers now so it can be more challenging but that's just been part of the Cooper tradition it's a rhythm family date nights we have family dinner around the dining room table two or three times a week and it can be more challenging with older kids but we still strive two or three times a week to gather the family around the dining room table it's a rhythm that has served our family well family vacation it's a rhythm of monthly budgeting tithing giving saving and investing it's a rhythm in our life it's a rhythm in our life I I eat fruits and vegetables but not last night I had apple pie oh Jesus I was somebody in the last service walked out so Pastor you had you had fruit apples of fruit I said Thank You Lord You're A wise man thank you for that right there but it's just a it's a weakness it's a rhythm I I try to exercise three or four times a week it's a weekly Rhythm that helps my life instead of hurting my life and one of the rhythms God has set up that so many people violate and they end up hurting their life instead of helping their life it's found in Exodus chapter number 20 and the ten Commandments the fourth of God's top ten is to remember the Sabbath and to keep it holy now it's interesting that taking a day off once a week made it on the same list as honor your father and mother do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal and and it's actually this taking a Sabbath day shows up on the list before any of those others that I just read to you what I want us to understand is this is very important to God why because to have a healthy and blessed life The rhythms of resting are just as important as The rhythms of working God even modeled this for us in Genesis chapter number two verse 2 says by the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing he was creating the heavens and the Earth so on the seventh day he rested from all his work then God blessed the seventh day come on Indianapolis campus come on everybody shout blessed yeah yeah God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done the God has a rhythm and he modeled this Rhythm for us six days work one day rest six days work one day rest six day work it's rhythm one day rests and understand this there's a blessing on the Sabbath day we see this even in the Ten Commandments Exodus chapter 20 verse 11 for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth the sea and all that is in them but he rested on the seventh day therefore the Lord notice this word blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy when God established the Sabbath day he put a blessing on it there is a blessing that will come upon your life if you honor God by taking off one day a week and we see several blessings right there in the Ten Commandments and I want to unpack several blessings that are in the Ten Commandments the the first blessing is this the blessing of rest the blessing of rest notice in Exodus chapter 20 verse number 8 says remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God on it you shall not do any work neither you nor your son or daughter nor your man servant or maidservant nor your animals nor the alien within your gates for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth the sea and all that is in them but notice this but he rested on the seventh day therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day and made it totally everybody say the word Sabbath yeah yeah the word Sabbath means to cease to quit to stop to rest the Sabbath day is literally a day of rest God says one day a week I want you to rest one day a week I don't want you to produce for your job I don't want you hustling for money one day a week and God is driving home a very important point about life and that is this we are human beings not human doings so one day a week rest get refreshed and God modeled this for us not because he needed it but because we need it and I want you to see this in Exodus chapter 31 verse 16 and 17. it's just the people of Israel must keep the Sabbath today by observing it from generation to generation this is a covenant obligation notice this for all time it is a permanent sign of my Covenant with the people of Israel for in six days the Lord made the Heaven and Earth but on the seventh day he stopped working and was refreshed God was refreshed this is such an interesting scripture is so rich insightful so thought provoking that God rested The God Who Never Sleeps No slumbers The God Who Never grows weary are tired he rested and the scripture says he was refreshed for six days God breathed out and created the heavens and the Earth but on the seventh day he breathed in and he rested he was refreshed he enjoyed everything that he had created and he said this is very good how many of you have heard the old saying before let me catch my breath anybody ever heard that saying before and the Sabbath day is a day for you to catch your breath for you to be refreshed and if you ignore the rhythm of the Sabbath day life and work will wear you out I love what Jesus says about the rhythms of rest in the Book of Matthew and I love it out of the message translation let me let me read this to you Matthew chapter 11 verse 28 says are you tired worn out burned out on religion come to me get away with me and you will recover your life I will show you how to take a real rest walk with me and work with me watch How I do it learn The unforced rhythms of Grace I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you keep company with me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly The unforced rhythms of Grace and we've created a society that avoids The rhythms of Grace we have a society that never sleeps never quits never stops never rest we're open 24 hours a day seven days a week on our phones we get information coming to us constantly we've designed a world that ignores the law of limits it's like driving a car without ever changing the oil has anybody ever done that before I I I've done it in high school my my first car my parents bought me was a Nissan Datsun pickup truck got that bad boy painted maroon I didn't care about the engine I cared about the speakers boy I'll put some speakers in that in that bad boy I'll pull up to the high school boom boom boom boom boom boom boom brother didn't change the oil but I have some speakers and guess what happened to that engine yeah yeah it it stopped working I'm not a mechanic but eventually if you don't change your oil something's going to overheat something's going to break down and fixing what breaks will cost you way more than doing the preventative maintenance here's the secret about the Sabbath if you don't select a Sabbath a Sabbath will select you so so you can just keep pushing you could just keep running frantically you could just keep saying I gotta you don't understand I just got to keep going I just I just got to keep running I just got to keep pushing ahead that's a great message preacher I hear you but I've got to just keep going I just gotta keep running and what's going to happen eventually your body or your mind will say time out it's Sabbath time I need some rest and then comes panic attacks heart attacks a nervous breakdown some other physical mental or emotional problem we have to select a Sabbath or a Sabbath we'll select us number two is this there's a second blessing that I want us to see in the Ten Commandments and that is this the blessing of priorities we see this in Exodus chapter 20 verse 9. it says six days you shall labor and do all your work if you have a Bible that with that's with your paper Bible just circle the word all do all your work six days to successfully manage our time we must properly weigh our priorities we must prioritize all the work we're going to do in each six day period it's the blessing of priorities the Sabbath what it does it helps you focus on what you really need to get accomplished in those six days six days you shall labor and do all your work here's the reality we're all busy we all have a lot going there's no that we can no there's no way we can get everything done in a six day period so what you and I must do is we have to realize there's a difference from what I must do and what I could do is priorities you got to determine what must I do and realize that's different than what I could do and once you determine what you must do in a six day period you got to prioritize it and you said well Pastor I do that and life happens yes it does life will happen the unexpected will happen and what I've learned in my own life is now I have to readjust my priorities if I'm going to take a Sabbath day it's the blessing of priorities we all come to the end of six days and say there's still more I could do yes but what must I do is different than what could I do the blessing of priorities there's a third blessing and that is this the blessing of trust notice this in Exodus chapter 20 verse 9 and 10 again it says six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God on it you should not do any work neither you nor your sons or daughter nor your man servant or mate servant nor your animals nor the alien within your Gates God says everybody needs a Sabbath day he said your children your employees your co-workers your animals all need a Sabbath day each week this is the blessing of trust because you're looking at all that you want to accomplish all that you really feel pressed to accomplish and you're thinking but God this is a great message for somebody else because I got a lot I got to get done this week and here's What God Says trust me but my children they need to work all the time we've got a lot to get accomplished as a family they gotta work God says trust me my employees my my co-workers they they need to work seven days a week for the next three months so that we can get the end of the year bonus God says trust me we have to trust God and His rhythms of rest more than we trust ourselves in our ability to work the psalmist said it like this Psalms chapter 20 verse 7 some trust in chariots some trust in horses but we trust in the name of the Lord our God and it's so easy to put your trust in the Chariots in the horses in your job in your bank account in your logic and when you and I trust in chariots and horses more than God here's what we're doing our Sabbath day we go to work anyways we check and return work emails anyways we take the work phone calls anyways we send the work tech text messages anyway and we miss the blessing that comes with trusting God I believe this with all of my heart this is why I take a Sabbath day I really believe this you will accomplish more in six days with God's blessings then you can accomplish in seven days without his Blessing God says trust me you got you got to trust me You You Gotta trust it's the blessing it's the blessing of trust as we do and when I what I love about Pastor Chris and Pastor Jamie there they live the Bible they preach the Bible but they make the Bible so applicable and so one of the things that I love is that we always strive to make the Bible applicable and I just have to say this what a beautiful Church this place looks like heaven I wish you could see what I see all the different skin colors and different ages can we give God praise come on for what he's doing around here at People's Church it's beautiful it's beautiful so what I want to do as I wrap up today is I really want to help you I I don't want to preach to your Sundays I want to preach to your Mondays so I want to bring some application to this message let me give you some application three practical applications about the Sabbath today number one is this avoid legalism it's huge there are people who get so caught up in keeping the Sabbath that they end up in legalism God did not intend the Sabbath day to be a burden but a blessing he didn't create it to limit us but to liberate us but by the time Jesus arrived on the scene the religious leaders of his day had put human hands on Godly intentions and they had made the Sabbath day a burden for the people Jesus talked about this in Matthew chapter 12 and verse number 9 it says going on from that place he went into the into their synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus they asked him is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath now notice this Jesus was asking them simply this question is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath on the day of rest verse 11 said he said to them if any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath will you not take hold of it and lift it out how much more valuable is a person than a sheep therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath then he said to the man stretch out your hands so he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other but the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus they want to kill Jesus for doing good on the Sabbath religious people and Jesus was teaching us not to be religious about the Sabbath listen I want you to understand this you can do good on the Sabbath day you can pray for somebody on the Sabbath you can believe for God to heal somebody on the Sabbath you can help people on the Sabbath you can serve people on the Sabbath you can bless people on the Sabbath well I just want to avoid legalism here's what Jesus said in Mark chapter 2 verse 27 then he said to them the Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath avoid legalism well Pastor I have to take off either Saturday or Sunday that's that it has to be a Saturday or Sunday if I'm going to really have a true Sabbath day no no you can take any day of the week off that works for you avoid legalism well I can't help my kids with their homework because it's the Sabbath that joker might flunk algebra you better help him avoid legalism I can't cook dinner on the Sabbath it's the Sabbath day I can just hear one spouse telling another spouse not tonight it's the Sabbath avoid legalism I can't mow the grass I can't clean out the flower beds I can't go golfing I can't go shopping I can't serve people I can't return the text I'm simply saying avoid legalism here's the goal here's the goal here's the goal of the Sabbath is to do your very best job to avoid producing for your job one day a week you want to do your best not to do anything work related one day a week avoid legalism number two is this here's a second practical application be intentional be intentional Proverbs 21 verse 5 says careful planning puts you ahead in the long run hurry and Scurry put you further behind it takes being intentional with your planning to take a Sabbath day let me preach to your Mondays right now I want to help you so Pastor how do I take a Sabbath day practically here's what I want you to do you got to be intentional about putting your Sabbath on your calendar so when you go home this is what I do when you go home block off your Sabbath on your calendar it may have to vary from different weeks maybe you only know your schedule a week at a time but when you get your schedule you block it off my Sabbath is every Friday I block all Fridays it's taken somebody calls needs an appointment with me I'm busy on a Friday it's me and the Lord it's blocked off you got to be intentional put it on your calendar here's here's our second thing be intentional to guard your Sabbath day or else you won't take it careful planning puts you ahead you got to guard the Sabbath day so I'm just guarding it I'm protecting it it's already on the schedule it's a day off with the Lord you gotta you gotta guard it or unless you will never take a Sabbath day so you put it on your calendar and you gotta go you already have a schedule it's our you already have an appointment you it's already filled up it's your Sabbath day here's a third about being intentional is be intentional about doing something that refreshes and replenishes you do something that refreshes and replenishes you sometimes on Friday Tiffany likes to go out in the yard and she wants to go on the flower bed and pull weeds she says out there enjoying it she asked me do I want to go pull weeds nope that sounds like the devil to me that's torture I don't want to go pull no weeds it's a horrible off day you want to see I don't want to go clean the garage it makes me feel like I accomplished something not me I just want to look at it dirty I wouldn't leave and go get some coffee like dude what I'm saying is you gotta do something that replenishes you on your Sabbath here's number three number three number three number three remember the Lord remember the Lord let's look back at the Ten Commandments and see something that's very important about the Sabbath day remember the Lord remember the Lord remember the Lord Exodus chapter 20 verse 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath notices to the Lord your God the Sabbath day is to the Lord you're not just taking off one day a week it's to the Lord is to honor the Lord is to remember the Lord we see this all over scripture again and again Exodus 16 verse 25 Moses said eat this food today for today is a Sabbath day dedicated to the lord it's about the lord it's about remembering the lord it's about honoring the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath day to the Lord your God it's about honoring the lord it's about remembering the Lord if we're not careful we will forgive the Lord and find ourselves worshiping our work working at our play and playing at our worship I don't want to play it My Worship I want to remember the Lord remember the Lord Leviticus chapter 19 verse 30. keep my Sabbath days of rest and show reverence toward My Sanctuary I am the Lord one of the ways we remember the Lord is by remembering his Sanctuary by remembering Church by saying God I honor you I give you my life I remember the Lord I love what the Bible says about Jesus in Luke chapter 4 verse 16. it says when he came to the Village of Nazareth his boyhood home he went as usual come on everybody's shot as usual he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the scriptures on the Sabbath day Jesus went to church as usual he read the scriptures as usual he worshiped as usual come on people's Church Indianapolis we gotta have some as usuals in our lives God I remember you as usual I I worship you as usual I praise you as usual I lift my hands as usual I shout as you I clap as usual I remember the Lord come on would you stand with me all around this building when somebody lifts your hands and remember the Lord today come and remember the Lord worship God as usual praise God as usual shout to God as usual give God some praise today
Ub1Jd0sLca8,well today we're starting a brand new series called throwback everybody say throwback you see during the next several weeks through the series together we're going to be encountering and learning some faith-building lessons from old testament heroes as well as singing several hymns and all their worship songs man i saw some of y'all during the work you didn't even need the screens like for the lyrics you were just like eyes closed hands lifted here i am to jesus or here i am the jesus wow uh oh how i love jesus here i am to worship and then some of you i could tell like you needed the screens you were like man they threw it back way too far where did these songs even come from that's all right because we still got several weeks to figure this out this is only week one but it's going to be an incredible series we don't want you to miss a single uh sunday during this series and so as we kick off the first installment of our series today if you're taking notes i want to give you the title of my message today here it is this is what's keeping you from your dream this is what's keeping you from your dream here at people's church we believe that god has always that god has eternally existed in three distinct persons god the father god the son and god the holy spirit if you've been the follower of jesus for a while or you've grown up in church you would probably know that dynamic if you will as the trinity or some may even call it the godhead we believe that uh each person in the trinity all three they are co-equal and they are one god and so many people many churches if you will they give their attention and also experience the first two persons of the trinity but unfortunately make the mistake of excluding the holy spirit from our preaching from our teaching from our worship and even our everyday normal lives as followers of jesus and as believers but we want you to know that here at people's church we want you to personally know and experience daily god the father god the son and god the holy spirit you see whenever we surrender and commit our lives to jesus christ we know that he comes to live inside of us as our lord and our savior and it's at this moment of salvation we know from scripture that we are then sealed with the holy spirit but then the bible even goes a step further in i believe it's ephesians chapter 5 verse 18 paul writes that we must continually be filled over and over again with the holy spirit but why exactly is that as followers of jesus do we need to experience the holy spirit why do we need to be filled with the power of the holy spirit you see you need to be filled with the power of the holy spirit to be a witness you need to be filled with the power of the holy spirit to grow into what the bible calls the fruit of the spirit you need to the power of the holy spirit to grow in the gifts of the spirit to grow in holiness becoming more and more like jesus but another reason and what i want to primarily focus on in our time together today another important reason we need to be filled with the holy spirit as well as stay full of the holy spirit so that we can know god's dream and god's vision for our lives because people who are full of the holy spirit are people who are full of dreams and visions from god i want you to look with me at what the apostle peter quoted from the old testament prophet joel in acts chapter 2 peter is uh giving his sermon on the day of pentecost and we pick up chapter 2 verse 17. peter said in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit on all people everybody say that together say all your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days and they will prophesy i love how the bible specifically tells us that god will pour out his spirit on all people that means that the power of the holy spirit that means the gifts of the holy spirit are available for both men and women the bible also takes it a step further and tells us that god gives visions and dreams to both the young and to the old and today if you're here that's why if you're a teenager or you're a young adult you're a young person you shouldn't allow anyone to stop you from dreaming big and from being used by god because what i've learned from my personal experience as the follower of jesus is that you can never ever be too young to be used by god in a powerful and mighty way know that god wants to give you a dream young person know that god has a dream for both your present and your future that god didn't create you to be normal god didn't create you to fit into the status quo and to conform to the ways and the patterns of our world and this culture god created you to be a dreamer he created you to be a world changer and a history maker that's all my young people if you're older please hear me today god is not done with you you woke up this morning that's a good start you've got breath in your body sitting here in the seat today you should not stop dreaming because if you're here that means god still has an assignment on your life and god still has a purpose for you to fulfill that has not been fulfilled yet come on i've heard it said in god's kingdom you don't retire you refire you see if you're older that means god's still wanting to use you in big ways and that your best days are still ahead of you and i think there's some people in the room today you need that fire reignited on the inside of you you need to get filled with the holy spirit over and over and again and again and once more get a hold of that dream again that god gave you all those years ago because here's the truth no matter who you are no matter how old you are people who are full of the holy spirit are people who are full of dreams and visions from god i tell you today great things always begin with a dream every great thing it starts with a dream you know i'm 23 years old i preached my first sermon ever when i was nine normal nine year old i'm sure um spent spent a lot of my teenage years early adult years preaching the gospel being a pastor loving on people ministering and i've loved it it's been a dream of mine for a long time but can i tell you that the dream god gave me that i'm walking in today it didn't start in a pulpit it didn't start with a microphone in my hand it actually started in my family's living room because y'all growing up a pastor's kid like we played like normal kids did but like we played church too so it was like i was the pastor i was the preacher my siblings led worship like yo we had a good time but eventually it got to the point where i was the only one who wanted to play church so then it's like well man you need a church to play church with so i started preaching the sheriff woody buzz lightyear uh anybody everybody who would just listen who would show up and didn't have a choice you know what i'm saying and it was like we had our swimming pool in the backyard i'm like i'm baptizing all my siblings i'm re-baptizing them like don't even know if it's biblical i'm just doing it you know just dunking them in the tank like it wasn't even given an option i'm just holding them down like praying them through like i tried to baptize the dog it didn't go so well and it's like i'm trying to get baptized to neighbors i'm just trying to baptize everybody but you see as as cute and funny as that was this a little boy being five six seven years old in all seriousness there was a dream that little boy had that came from god that didn't start here where it is today it started in a family living room it started in a backyard swimming pool because every move of god every great move of god it always starts with a dream that comes from god every great move of god whether it be in your family your career your future our church in our lives it all starts with a dream from god today i want to draw your attention to genesis chapter 37 where we encounter the beginning of a powerful story about a young man in the old testament that the bible specifically called the dreamer the dreamer here's what the bible says about this young man named joseph the dreamer in genesis chapter 37 beginning at verse 5 it says that joseph had a dream and when he told it to his brothers they hated him all the more so the first thing i noticed is that joseph had a dream but it wasn't just any dream it was a dream that came from god god gave joseph a dream for his life and i think the first thing we need to understand today is that it is so vital to have a dream for your life but not just any dream the dream that comes from god because the truth is if you are not following god's dream for your life that means one or two things one you're following your dream for your life or you're following somebody else's dream for your life and let me just tell you following your dream or somebody else's dream it never leads to a good result the bible says in proverbs 29 18 when people do not accept divine guidance they run wild but whoever obeys the law is joyful y'all that's the throwback series so i just thought i had to pull out the king james on you too is that all right the king k some people are like you can speak to king james i'm like it's not a foreign language like this is old english the king james version it says where there is no vision the people perish you see where there is no vision where there's no divine guidance from god in somebody else's lives the bible says people run wild and that's why all of us we desperately need divine guidance not just natural guidance we need the kind of guidance counsel and wisdom that comes from god my friend you need divine counsel or you need divine guidance for your dating you need it for your marriage you need divine guidance for your finances for your decisions you need it for your parenting your career and your future you see i believe that today god wants to give you his dream for your life just like he did for joseph but here's something i want you to think about do you know how many years it actually took for joseph's dream the dream god gave him to actually happen because scripture tells us that from the very first moment god revealed this dream to joseph to the moment it finally came true 13 years had passed and what we learned from the story of joseph is that during those 13 years he encountered a lot of adversity he encountered several obstacles and setbacks that stood between him and god's dream for his life today i want to ask you a personal question what is standing in the way of you and god's dream in your life at this very moment in time what is standing between you and the dream that god gave you because i believe that jos like joseph we all go through circumstances and experience hardships in our lives that the enemy will try to use to persuade us to quit on the dreams that god has marked on our lives well what i love about the story of joseph is that all throughout the book from from genesis chapter 37 to genesis chapter 50 there's this phrase repeated over and over and over again throughout the story that says the lord was with joseph and i believe today that the lord is with you as well i believe that just as god allow helped joseph empowered him to not lose sight of his dream for his life but to hold on to it through the obstacles and through the setbacks i believe in the same way that through the power of god's word and with the help of the holy spirit we're going to be encouraged today to overcome these obstacles so that we can keep believing keep pursuing and keep dreaming god's dream so as we look further into the story of joseph today i want to give you five obstacles that stand in between you and your dream and the first obstacle is this number one details stand between you and your dream what i've learned in in my in my young life not only from my young life but also from the word of god is that when god gives you a dream he rarely gives you all the details with it if any details whatsoever are there any are there any planners in the room like y'all i'll thank but god bless all of you seriously um i'll never forget being 16 years old a sophomore in high school coming down the stairs one saturday morning and i was greeted not with a good morning how are you son we love you you're blessed and highly favored it was i came down the stairs and my dad immediately just go son what's your five year plan and i was like huh he was like where do you envision where do you see yourself five years from now being awake for less than five minutes i looked at my dad i go dad i don't even know what i'm about to pull out of the refrigerator for breakfast here in a couple moments what what are you talking about a five-year plan for my life but if if if you think about it all joseph really had was a dream that's it like all joseph knew was god is going to put me in a leadership position and i'm going to have power and authority over my family that's all joseph knew in the moment joseph didn't under didn't know when it was going to happen he didn't know how it was going to happen he there was so many specifics and information about his dream he did not have and i think there's so many of us in this room today we get so frustrated about the dream god gave us and we get so frustrated at god because of the details we don't have we get so caught up in the details we fail to realize that god operates through faith through trust and obedience and not always in the details god gives us the dream but he rarely ever gives us the details i i heard this saying over and over again growing up and maybe you've heard it as well the devil is in the details man i believe that is so true when it comes to god's dream for your life because the devil will want to get you so distracted on the details you don't have what you haven't figured out and ultimately what he's doing he is keeping you from taking the next step that's directly in front of you that god has already revealed to you when it concerns his dream for your life proverbs 16 9 says that we can make our plans but the lord determines our steps you see it's great to have plans it's wonderful that we have dreams it's so incredible to have visions but we always need to remember that the lord is the one who determines our steps and he won't always show us all the details but he does always show us the next step we must take uh psalm 17 5 it says this my steps have stayed on your path i have not wavered from following you my friend to see god's dream come to pass in your life you have to stay on god's path you cannot waver from divine guidance to begin to follow after the opinions of other people you can't afford to follow after your feelings and your emotions you can't afford to follow after the ideologies of culture and society you have to stay on the path that god has set for you because remember your dream didn't come from the world your dream didn't come from dad and mom it didn't come from a significant other your dream came from god and god alone he is the one who determines your steps and he knows the path you need to follow i love what job 23 verse 11 says my feet have closely followed his steps i have kept to his way without turning aside man people's church you need to closely follow god and learn how to stay close to jesus i preach to our middle school and high school students almost every wednesday night i tell them you need divine guidance in your life and you're only going to get it by being in the presence of jesus and we pre teach them practically spend at least 15 minutes every day in god's presence we call it five five five spend five minutes in god's word spend five minutes in prayer spend five minutes in worship because you need divine guidance that's why every year at people's church we start the month of january 21 days of prayer and fasting that's why next month in august we're going to do 21 days of prayer we'll meet here at the church during the week at 6 00 am until 7 00 am why because we need divine guidance psalm 119 133 it says god my steps by your word so i will not be overcome by evil you see one of the ways that god provides us with divine guidance is simply through his word you know i think sometimes we can get so caught up in wanting to hear the the the audible voice of god in our physical ear that we just need it to be crystal clear when god is saying hey i've already spoken to you through my word the bible says that that the word of god it's alive and active it's speaking to us it's giving us guidance so whenever you need to know to take your next step or what decision you make man open up god's word and find direction we need to depend upon the word of god to guide our steps jeremiah 10 23 it says lord i know that people's lives are not their own it is not for them to direct their steps people's church it is not for you to direct your steps stay close to jesus psalm 37 23 it says the steps of a good man or a good person they're ordered by the lord and he delights in his way my friend don't get so caught up in the details about god's dream for your life that you get distracted to the point where you never even take the next step in front of you what god has already shown you i'll never forget when i graduated high school at 18 years old i thought i knew god's dream for my life but i soon found out that it was never god's dream for my life it was andrew's dream for andrew's life i thought i thought i would go four years of bible college out of state um graduate at 22 with my bachelor's degree and lead my own church and now i'm 23 and i'm a youth pastor and i look back and i'm like what were you thinking like wanting that i'm like you weren't thinking that was the problem but you see i had a moment where i realized that my dream was not the same as god's dream and i had a moment where i had to surrender my dream and say yes to god's dream and when i did that i was like great god's going to split the sky reveal all the details to me no he didn't i was like god where do i go what do i do because door after door was closing for christian universities and bible colleges just financially and so there was literally one door open and i was like well god if this is the only door you kept open it must be the one i'm supposed to take and i even remember just kind of being angry and bitter like god i'm settling i'm staying home i'm doing school online i'm still stuck at this church and the only opportunity they have for me is an internship with the youth ministry and i wanted nothing to do with youth ministry coming from the youth pastor i was like wanted nothing to do with teenagers i'm like give me all the old people you know what i'm saying so i remember just taking it but i i remember not having all the details and just knowing there was a step in front of me a door god left open and whenever i began to to take it my dream ended up becoming god's dream i delighted myself in the lord and he then gave me the desires of my heart and i'm so thankful that in that moment god didn't need me to have it all figured out i didn't need all the information all the details i just simply needed to say yes and be obedient and trust god after i took the next step my friend don't let details stand in the way of you in your dream here's the second thing that stands between you and your dream number two adversity stands between you and your dream if you know anything about the story of joseph you know adversity was no stranger to joseph in his dream genesis 37 we read his brothers sold him into slavery because they hated him for his dream in genesis 39 he's falsely accused by his master's wife of rape and he's thrown into prison as a result if that's not enough for you in genesis chapter 40 after joseph helped interpret the chief cupbearer's dream he he had been sent to prison lost his job and joseph helps him interpret his dream he's like guess what homeboy you about to get your job back and you're going to get promoted but whenever you see the boss upstairs make sure you tell him about me how it helped you so he can get me out of here too too he's like joseph yo you my dude i got you so then sure enough joseph's interpretation is correct in the guy he gets promoted again guess what he forgets all about poor joseph for 13 years joseph encountered much adversity before he finally began to see his dream come to pass man can i tell you the truth is that adversity will always stand in the way between you and god's dream for your life and you can't let adversity stop you from pursuing that dream my friend don't think that you're outside of god's will for your life because it's hard i want you to know today adversity always plays a part of divine destiny which is why you should never give up whenever things get hard even when your dream seems impossible i almost didn't share this today but i felt like when i woke up and was preparing for the message today that the holy spirit wanted me to swallow some pride and insecurity and share it because from the time i was 10 years old all the way to when i was 20 and i'm not exaggerating there was never a moment in my life where i had the slightest doubt about who god called me to be and what he called me to do what my purpose was i knew beyond the shadow of a doubt i had no doubt whatsoever i was confident walking in my calling walking in my purpose for ten years every day for almost the past two years i have wrestled with insecurity i have wrestled with fear i have wrestled with doubt more than i can count i've strongly felt and experienced the urge to quit to throw in the towel and give up god i'm not sure if this is really for me god i thought it was when i was younger but i'm not so sure right now i'm not sure if i'm capable or if you created me for this i'm not sure that i have what it takes and oddly enough i was starting to feel this way right during the season in which i actually officially became like a a licensed minister or a reverend if you will and so you know people were seeing it on facebook commenting posting you know congratulations and i was really thankful for all of that but there was the very last facebook post that was made it came from a from an old pastor friend of mine who's been in ministry longer than i've been alive and what he wrote on my facebook wall i took a screenshot of it and i wrote it down i've held on to it ever since he he wrote this to me he said do not forget in the dark what god revealed to you in the light i've held on to it ever since and it helped me see that i've come too far to give up now i've seen and experienced too much of god's goodness and god's faithfulness in my life to throw in the towel and quit on god's dream because the night cannot whisper away the dream that god gave you in the light and so if adversity my friend is standing in the way between you and your dream today don't quit don't give up third obstacle that stands between you and your dream is this number three temptation temptation stands between you and your dream in genesis chapter 39 verse number six it says so potiphar this is joseph's master he left everything he had in joseph's care with joseph in charge he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate y'all he's living a good life says now joseph was well built and handsome all right but it says and after a while his master's wife took notice of joseph and said come to bed with me uh-oh you know i've learned that whenever you're walking in the favor of god the enemy you always take notice kind of like how potiphar's wife took notice of joseph walking in god's dream for his life verse 8 it says but he refused with me in charge he told her my master does not concern himself with anything in the house everything he owns he has entrusted to my care no one is greater in this house than i am my master has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife how then could i do such a wicked thing in sin against god and though she spoke to joseph day after day how many you know temptation just speaks day after day moment after moment but it says he refused to go to bed with her or even be in the same room as her and verse 11 it says one day he went into the house to attend to his duties and no one none of the household servants was inside she caught him by his cloak and said come to bed with me and it's in this moment says he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house my friend if you want to be like joseph and live according to god's dream for your life you cannot afford to entertain or flirt with sin and temptation y'all he didn't text her back he got brother ghosted her he wasn't sliding into the dms joseph said uh-uh there's a calling on my life there's an anointing there's a dream god has given me and i cannot compromise it everywhere you look temptation will always be around the corner looking for you the bible says that when temptation was knocking on the door of the dreamer to kill the dream god had put inside him joseph ran from temptation and can i tell you today the word of the lord says don't play around or mess around with temptation some of us may be getting too close to it but whenever temptation comes to stand between you and the dream god gave you my friend you need to put on your running shoes and do what the bible says you need to run from temptation and to do what hebrews chapter 12 says and you need to run to jesus looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith set your attention on the dream that god gave you my friend when temptation comes between you and god's dream for your life run away from it and run with the dream god gave you a fourth thing fourth thing that stands between you and your dream number four is the selfishness stands between you and your dream if you look at genesis chapter 50 near the end of the story in verse 20 joseph is reunited with his brothers and he reveals his identity to them here's what he told them in verse 20. you intended to harm me but god intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives you know it's fascinating to me that joseph never retaliated or tried to get revenge at his brothers he didn't repay evil for evil instead of being selfish he was selfless and noticed this he was never fixated on everything that had personally happened in his life but instead he was able to see that god had strategically and divinely orchestrated everything that had happened in his life even when god didn't cause everything that happened in his life god had used everything in his sovereignty to not only save an entire nation through joseph but to save future generations that were to come following afterwards and hear me today i believe in the same way the devil can try to persuade us and influence this to take everything that's happened to us and use it to harbor this bitterness and the selflessness and my friend it will stand between you and god's dream for your life the last thing that stands between you and your dream number five is this last thing haters stand between you and your dream if you look at the end of the story or sorry beginning of the story genesis chapter 37 joseph is looking for his brothers and he's going out to meet them verse 17 it says they have moved on from here the man answered i heard them say let's go to dothan so joseph went after his brothers and found them near dothan but they saw him in the distance and before he reached them they plotted to kill him you have to remember joseph's brothers hated him because he was the dreamer because he was the one with the dream and it may not come to surprise you today to hear that not everybody is for you not everybody will be your biggest supporter and encourager of the dream that god has in store for your life not everybody in your life wants to see it come to pass and come to fruition but the story goes on in verse 19. i love this here comes the dr that dreamer they said to each other come now let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him then we'll see what comes of his dreams when reuben heard this he tried to rescue him from their hands let's not take his life he said don't shed any blood throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness but don't lay a hand on him reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father i've gone up in church my whole life been preaching for a long time there's one thing in the story i've overlooked for years that i didn't capture until recently it's so powerful and i just pray that it blesses somebody today the same way it's blessed me joseph's brothers wanted to kill him because of his dream i want you to understand that when the anointing and the favor of god is so strong on your life when god has given you a dream and a purpose the only way that the devil can kill the dream that god gave you is to kill the dreamer all of joseph's brothers wanted to kill him except for who is ruben rubin was the one who stood up in the group and said uh-uh don't you even lay a finger on the dreamer it was reuben who was the one that wanted to keep the dreamer alive y'all this is the last thing i have to say and i promise i'm i'm done i believe today that there's many of us in this room there's so many things we've experienced in our lives that have tried to come after and kill the dream that god has given us the devil has been working overtime to try to take you out and to kill your dream people have discouraged you from pursuing god's dream for your life your past mistakes your failures have been holding you back from being the dreamer that god created you to be but i believe that god sent me here today to be somebody's reuben and to tell you don't you dare let the devil kill your dream don't you dare let pride and insecurity kill your dream don't let fear and doubt kill the dream that god gave you don't let depression and anxiety kill the dream that god gave you the devil didn't give it the world didn't give it and the world and the devil can't take it away don't let the devil kill your dream keep dreaming keep pursuing keep moving forward because the dream that god gave you i don't care what stands between you and it today it will come to pass keep dreaming would you keep loving people would you keep serving on the dream team would you keep tithing keep giving would you keep praying keep fasting keep seeking the face of god keep dreaming god's dream no matter how difficult or how long it takes for what's standing in the way today keep dreaming god's dream
7UP8PSXXS08,well we are wrapping up our 20-year celebration the series we are people's church just celebrating all that god has done the last 20 years and if you've missed any week of this series i'd encourage you to go on our youtube page people's church indianapolis and watch those message messages and as we wrap it up today the title of my message is this we are a place of hope everybody say hope oh y'all aren't awake yet come on let's try that again everybody say hope all right we are a place of hope in our main text today the story we're going to be this message is going to be based off of is luke chapter 10 verse 25 through 37 read it here with me it says on one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test jesus teacher he asked what must i do to inherit eternal life what is written in the law jesus replied how do you read it he answered love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself you have answered correctly jesus replied do this and you will live and the word of god says but he wanted to justify himself so we asked jesus well and who is my neighbor and in reply jesus said a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho that would have annoyed some of you you'd be like why aren't you answering my question why are you trying to tell me a story but jesus answered his question with the story he said a man was going from jerusalem to jericho when he was attacked by robbers they stripped him of his clothes beat him and went away leaving him half dead a priest happened to be going down the road and when he saw the man he passed by on the other side so to a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a samaritan as he traveled came where the man was and when he saw him he took pity on him he went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil pouring on oil and wine then he put the man on his donkey and brought him to an inn and took care of him the next day he took out two dinari and gave them to the innkeeper look after him he said and when i return i will reimburse you for the extra expense you may have jesus then said which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers the expert in the law replied the one who had mercy on him jesus told him go and do likewise jesus tells a story where a man was attacked he was beaten up and he was left for dead and as i read about this passage and study it for the sermon today i started to think about all the people in our world who have been beat up by life life can beat you up life can be hard cruel and ugly people have been beaten up by their own family neglected abused abandoned beat up at school with name-calling verbal and physical abuse beat up by being raised in an environment full of violence crime drug and alcohol addiction life can beat you up your family can beat you up school can beat you up your job can beat you up friends can beat you up your environment can beat you up social media can beat you up society and culture can beat you up but at people's church we don't beat you up we get you up we don't beat you up we lift you up we are a place of hope for the hurting for the harassed the helpless and hopeless we are a place of hope everybody say hope i want to share with you four ways we bring hope to the hurting four ways we bring hope to the hurting first is this don't pass by don't pass by jesus said a priest and a levite saw this man half dead and walked right on by they have no clue what happened to this man all they know is they saw this man hopeless fighting for his life but instead of stopping by they passed right on by why would they pass by a hurting and hopeless person and do nothing why would we walk past hopeless hurting person and do nothing let me give you some reasons why we might walk on by pass by those that are hurting and hopeless number one is inconvenience coming the calendar the clock is i got places to be i got things to do and you're busy and you're running late and all of a sudden you see somebody hurting and hopeless and you're like man if i help them i'll miss this me i i just don't have time and so we pass right on matter of fact come on we don't even look because we know if we look and make eye contact we may have to stop but we got a meeting we got we got places we got come on we're gonna be late to this or late to that and so because of inconvenience or come on you just got those new shoes got that new outfit and oh but they're all bloody i mean i mean i just i just spent a lot of money on these kicks and on this outfit and inconvenience would cause us to not look to just pass right on by those that are hurting those that are hopeless i'll never forget it was a few years ago i was at the chiropractor and i went in there early and i had a busy day and so i wanted to get in early get my neck and back taken care of and the chiropractor did his thing and as i was walking out there was a mom with her kids and we had an event coming up at people's church and i i had invite cards come on we are all about the invite cards we're trying to help you invite some people and i i normally have them in my back pocket so i went in my back pocket and i didn't have any of my cars and i just kept on walking well man prison lord i guess you didn't want me to invite them to but i had some in my car and i knew that but i was thinking oh man i'm going she already saw me walk by that would be awkward i mean i got this meeting i got to go to i'm kind of pressed for time and i'm literally trying to talk myself out of it the whole way and you ever had one of those moments where god's just like tapping you on the shoulder like that's what was going on the whole way to the car i was trying to well it's just one convenient one going to work i look stupid i don't got enough time chris go give that lady a card and so i listened i'm like all right let me grab a card and i was feeling a little awkward cause i already walked by and i didn't say anything to her because i didn't have a card and but i went back anyway i came back in i said hey i know you just saw me walk by but i wanted to invite you guys we have an event at our church and and so i was able to just talk with her a little bit about the church invite her we got fun stuff for the kids and the kids were like yay and you know what it took some time out of my day it made me late to an appointment and it was a bit of an inconvenience but i was able to invite her and sure enough next sunday she was at church kids in kids church they ended up loving people's church she ended up getting baptized at people's church listen it's so easy to get caught up thinking people are an inconvenience and we just pass on by god wants us to make time don't pass by let me give you another reason that we pass by we prejudge we walk by people because we draw conclusions on why someone is beat up when we don't even know any of the facts it's easy to look at someone who is beat up in life and judge them and condemn them they must i don't know what they did but no i bet they won't do it again my goodness what in the world i hope they figured it out and so we start we start pre-judging people and it's easy to condem when we don't know people's story everybody has a story and whenever i take time to listen to people i begin to understand there's a story behind their hurt in their horrible situation there's oftentimes a story of pain or trauma that led to someone starting to use drugs that led to them to be to be to poverty led them to homelessness or addiction there's a story about trauma or pain that led to low self-esteem suicidal thoughts or giving their body away to multiple people over and over again that there's a story of pain or trauma that led them to emotional instability and poor decisions our job as a christ follower is not to judge and condemn every person who is beat up in life and just walk right by them look what james chapter 2 verse 15 and 16 says it says suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food if one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and well fed but does nothing about their physical needs what good is it oftentimes when we see someone without clothes or food or in a horrible situation we pass by because we judge first instead of loving first we condemn first instead of listening first if we see someone in a horrible situation and all we do is nothing but condemn them we don't have the kind of faith that pleases god let me give you a third reason we pass by third reason we pass people by is we don't believe in people we pass people by because we think it's too late there's no hope they're too far gone they can't be helped he's basically dead and we just keep walking it's too late can't be healed can't be saved can't be changed i don't know about you but i thank god for some people that believed in me when life had beat me up and knocked me out and tried to leave me half dead i i thank god for the people that believe in me but sometimes we pass on by because we think there's no hope there's no chance they're too far gone let me give you a fourth reason that we passed by we believe it's not my responsibility someone else will take care of them that's not my calling that's not my burden pastor god didn't give me the gift to help the hurting or the broken those hurting people those they are not my neighbor i'm sure god's gonna bring somebody else to take care of them and help them but jesus told the pharisee no no your neighbor is all the people right around you that you keep passing by go and do likewise like the good samaritan go and help hurting and broken people but pastor there are way too many people how can you help all these people listen we can't help everybody but that shouldn't be an excuse not to help somebody we can't help everybody but that should not be an excuse not to help somebody do for one what you want to do for all help somebody people's church is not a church that just passes by the needs of hurting people we are a place of hope we don't beat people up we get people uh let me share with you another way we bring hope to the hurting another way we bring hope to the hurting number two is have pity have pity luke chapter 10 verse 33 it says but a samaritan as he traveled came where the man was and when he saw him he took pity on him the samaritan had pity on the man he saw a man that was hurting that was wounded left for dead and he took pity on him oh god please let the needs of hurting humanity bother us disturb us break our hearts oh god let it break our hearts when we see hurting and the lost and the confused and the addicted and abused and those suffering in poverty murder and homelessness lord don't let us be desensitized by all the pain and hurt and trauma and wickedness and brokenness all around us being a church of hope means that we will always have pity like the good samaritan we will have empathy and compassion for hurting people just like jesus did look at matthew chapter 9 verse 36 it says when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd jesus helped and he healed people because he was first moved with compassion he knew every person has a story he knew their story and he saw that their stories that they were harassed and helpless and he had compassion on them look at luke chapter 15 verse 20 it's the story of the prodigal son and it says so he got up the prodigal son and went to his father it says but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son through his arms around him and kissed him see when we lack compassion we walk away from the hurting and the broken but when we have compassion we run to the hurting and broken people see the the prodigal son he was wrong he made some stupid decisions he said dad i don't want anything to do with you give me my inheritance deuces i'm out of here and then he went and he squandered all of it and he was hanging out with some pigs in some pigs flop but when he came back the father still had compassion that when he saw his son he ran to him god give us a compassion not only those for those that are harassed and helpless but lord give us a compassion for those that made some stupid decisions as well come on i mean it can be a little harder to have compassion on those that made their own bed sometimes we want them just asleep and lying but god's saying no no no no you need to pick them up love them run and help hurting and broken people give us hearts of compassion colossians chapter 3 verse 12 it says therefore as god's chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience god clothe us with compassion come on would you take 30 seconds with me right now would you pray that right now with me god clothed us with compassion for the hurting and the broken and the lost father god for those that are harassed and those are helpless those that have been foolish god clothed us from the head to our toes every day let us be clothed with compassion see our world needs christians who are full of the holy spirit and who are clothed with compassion for them god may people's church always be a place of compassion love forgiveness kindness joy goodness a place of restoration healing biblical solutions and hope god give us compassion to get people up not beat people up we're a place of hope let me share with you the third way that we bring hope to the hurting number three number three is heal people don't hurt people heal people don't hurt people in luke chapter 10 34 you read how the good samaritan now he went to this man and he abandoned his wounds and he's pouring oil and and wine all into his wounds because what he was doing was he wanted to clean this man's wounds so that the wounds would not become infected so that his wounds would heal properly this is such a beautiful picture of what god has called us to be as a church that we are a place of hope and healing that no matter how beat up someone's life is people's church exists to bring hope and healing we bring hope and healing with the love of god we bring hope and healing with the word of god and we bring hope and healing with the spirit of god then the bible says he took the man the good samaritan and put him on his donkey and carried him to the end what a phenomenal picture of our calling as a church people have been beat up by life and god has called us to help carry people to a safe place to experience hope and healing look at galatians chapter 6 verse 2 it says carry each other's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ people are weighed down by heavy burdens of trauma failure wounds hurts habits and hang-ups and people's church we exist to carry others burdens to carry people's burdens we carry people's burdens by inviting them to church we carry by serving on the dream team every sunday and wednesday we carry people's burdens through our small groups matter of fact our summer small group semester is about to start it's from june 5th to july 30th would you lead a

group so would you text in would you sign up we'll get in touch with this you this week and we'll help you lead a group this summer we have to heal people don't hurt people and then number four do what you can with what you have do what you can with what you have let's look at luke 10 verse 34 through 35 he went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring on oil and why and then and then he put the man on his own donkey and he brought him to an inn and took care of him the bible then says the next day he took out two dinari and he gave them to the innkeeper look after him he said and when i return i'll reimburse you for any extra expense that you may have he took this man put him on his own donkey gave the innkeeper some money so that he can take care of this man but i want you to notice what he couldn't do for this man he couldn't stay with the man at the end he couldn't take with he couldn't take the man with him on his trip he couldn't pay for the man's family to come stay with him at the end but he didn't let what he couldn't do stop him from doing what he could do he did what he could with what he had and that's all god wants from you and me do what we can with what we have do what you can with what you have and as we wrap up this series we are people's church celebrating 20 years i want to thank you for being a church that does what you can with what you have to bring hope and healing to hurting and broken people people church you are amazing people god is blessing your life he is blessing our church because you do what you can with what you have to bring hope and

somebody merry christmas it's christmas tomorrow and so merry christmas to all of you from my family to yours and we love uh christmas time it's one of our most favorite times of the year and i'm sure like your family we have a lot of christmas traditions the smith family traditions and i thought i would just share with you guys a few of our smith family christmas traditions and so one of our traditions is every year my wife buys advent calendars for our children there's these calendars and and inside of them they have chocolates leading up to all 25 days of christmas so on december 1st you get to open the little little window that says a 1 on it and you get to get your little chocolate and every morning you get to open up the next window until the 25th and my kids love it and especially my three-year-old cohen he actually kind of understands it right now i got a picture of him he loves it listen this little boy does not forget about his advent calendar okay matter of fact every morning when he wakes up first thing he's asking for is mommy daddy can i get my chocolate out of my calendar yes cohen and so we take him downstairs and he gets his little chocolate but i promise you y'all the last 24 days okay after he gets his little chocolate in the morning he probably asked five times a day to get another chocolate out of his calendar like he doesn't understand there's not unlimited chocolate in there it's only one a day i mean he'd be really happy if there was an advent calendar that gave you five a day because at lunch dinner in the afternoon daddy i want to go get the chocolate out of my calendar i'm like no you got to wait till the morning all right and then two hours later daddy daddy daddy can i get the chocolate out of my calendar no you got i mean every day he is asking for that uh chocolate who knows what's going to happen after the 25th i promise you on december 26th he's going to be asking for another chocolate and we're going to explain to him there's no more chocolates he ate them all but that's one of our family traditions another one of our family traditions is christmas movies we have a couple christmas movies we make sure every year uh we watch together as a family and uh this first movie it is one of our favorites and i've come to find out that people either love it or hate it i don't know how you could hate this movie but but one that we watch every year check out this picture oh the elf come on that is one of our favorite favorite favorite we look come on how many i love the elf where are my elf lovers out there where am i okay now where are the cotton-headed nitty muggins that you're like i can't outstand that movie okay there's a lot that i'm telling you i did not know this i was like i thought everybody loved the elf but not everybody loves the elf but that is one we have to watch every christmas and then another one me and my family our kids we love to watch is this one home alone oh man we've probably watched those multiple times and i know some of y'all really traditional folks you're like are you kidding me miracle on 34th street it's a wonderful life like where are the those are our those are our two that we always have to watch every christmas another christmas tradition for us is that a christmas morning once everybody is awake we all get go downstairs around the christmas tree and before we start opening any presents i read to our family the christmas story out of luke chapter two and so we take a moment to read that story out of the bible and then we pray we pray together and we thank the father for sending his son jesus for the birth of christ how he a savior was born and so we have that special moment and the kids know we don't touch any presents until we do that first and then we say amen and then normally presents start flying all over the place but we do that every single christmas uh another one of our christmas tradition is my wife makes her famous cinnamon rolls oh i didn't bring a picture y'all cause i don't wanna make y'all jealous okay i just i didn't need y'all salivating during service and i didn't wanna be salivating but these christmas rolls they make em christmas eve and we i can eat we eat them in the morning i could eat them all day sometimes i do eat them all day they are just that good they stay good all day long so we do that my mom every christmas makes her famous lasagna this is the only time you will get this lasagna you want the lasagna any other day of the week it ain't happening you better come over for christmas i guess it's a labor of love i've never made a lasagna i wouldn't know but it is like christmas that is the only day you were gonna get my mom's lasagna so that's a a christmas tradition and and then lastly for our family we love to go look at christmas lights around the city uh almost every year we go downtown we got a picture of the monument circle we always go and we see those lights and uh we we love lights matter of fact my daughter uh and my wife every year we seem to have more lights that appear on our house and in our front yard and so they are they are stockpiling my my my daughter compares our house to other houses in the neighborhood she's like they got more lights than us like i'm afraid she's going to steal their stuff one day but but she's only 10. you know matter of fact she already bought some of her own christmas lights and i'm like man if she starts right now hey y'all when she's 30 her house is gonna be off the chain okay it's gonna be i cannot wait to see my daughter's house when she is 30 because it will be the most lit up christmasy house in the neighborhood she i mean she's already planning it out she's already my neighbors don't even know god bless him but she is she is planning it out and so those are just some of ours uh and i know you have probably some of your own christmas traditions but can i tell you the christmas tradition that i'm most grateful for is peace see christmas wasn't always peaceful uh in our household there was a season in jamie and i's marriage where everything looked good you know we we came to church and looked good had a big old smile we took the obligatory christmas selfie at church and said merry christmas everyone from the smith family and we had the cards that we sent out with big old smiles on our face but on the reality there was a lot of fighting there was a lot of arguing we were going through some tough times in our marriage and christmas was not very peaceful but i thank god that he's done a work in my life he's done the work in jaime's life i thank god that he has done a work in our marriage he has brought healing joy and peace and i am so thankful for several years we have peace on christmas we can smile and it's a legit smile doesn't mean we don't have issues but we now know how to work through them and forgive and love one another and so it's one of the most things i'm most thankful for during the christmas time and i realize for some of you one of the best christmas gifts you could receive this christmas is peace that for some of you you're like god if i could just have one thing just one thing peace that for some of you right now this season you are stressed anxious just covered in worry that for some of you right now there are fractured relationships that you're tired some of you are lonely that for some of you the christmas time is not a time of joy it's a time of grieving maybe you've been grieving for years maybe this is your first christmas of grief because you lost a loved one that for some of you this christmas you feel understood some of you you're just angry some are sad filled with sorrow some some are just frustrated and you would just say you don't have any peace see god knew that peace would be one of the most sought out after commodities in our world and that's one of the reasons god sent jesus into the world see isaiah prophesied these words about jesus 700 years before jesus was born look at isaiah chapter 9 verse 6. it says for to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace everybody say prince ah well we when we normally think of the word prince some of you are like me i think of fresh prince of bel air hey come on anybody there in west philadelphia boy not everybody thinks but most people when they think of the word prince they think of a son of the king but that's not what this word means the word literally means the word prince in this scripture literally means head person captain lord governor the man in charge the the go-to guy the the romans actually had a very similar word that they used for their ruler he was called caesar julius caesar augustus caesar nero caesar they were the head guy the lord the captain the man in charge of the nation and so when the when people are reading this scripture that jesus is the prince of peace it's saying he's the head guy of your well-being the captain of your wholeness he he's the go-to guy for your rest and he is the ruler of your peace see the economy is not the ruler of your peace kovit is not the captain of your well-being the stock market is not the lord of your wholeness come on the housing market gas prices the alcohol bottle pill bottle ice cream social media friends spouse boyfriend girlfriend your kids even the christmas gifts under your tree are not the ruler of your peace jesus christ is the prince of peace and i know some of you here today would say but pastor i don't have peace i'm anxious i'm nervous i'm scared i'm a mess on the inside i i got put on a good face and it looks like it's all good and i'll post the merry christmas picture with the smile but deep down inside i feel all messed up i have turmoil and chaos no peace and so you may be asking how do i allow jesus to be my prince of peace because i desperately want and need peace and i want to help you find peace today and so number one is this peace comes from surrendering to christ peace comes from surrendering to christ you can't have the peace of god without having peace with god you can't have the peace of god without having the peace without having peace with god see the peace of god isn't like the peace you get from this world the world's peace is dependent on what's happening in your life the world's peace it comes and goes based on your circumstances but the peace of god is constant god's peace is present in the midst of storms trials and tribulation god's peace is present in spite of covet division chaos death problems and struggles in our world but it's impossible for you to have the peace of god without having peace with god look at ephesians chapter 2 verse 13 through 14. it says but now in christ jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of christ for he himself is our peace see sin it separates us from god and being separated from god causes us to be separated from peace listen you don't need to chase peace you need to surrender to the prince of peace let me say that again you don't need to chase peace too many folks they're trying to chase peace they're trying to chase peace through a bottle a drug a pill a thrill a dollar a person or a possession so many people are trying to chase peace but you don't need to chase peace you need to surrender to peace you need to surrender to jesus the prince of peace and when you surrender your life to jesus you get peace because jesus himself is our peace look at romans 5 1 it says therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ putting our faith and trust in christ gives us peace with god you don't have to chase peace you have to surrender to peace the prince of peace acts 10 36 it says you know the message god sent to the people of israel telling the good news of peace through jesus christ who is lord of all jesus is lord of all and he wants to be your lord see peace comes for making jesus the lord of your life you don't have to chase peace you have to surrender to peace and after you surrender your life to jesus you will have peace with god and the peace of god that's how you get peace and so the next question is well how do i maintain peace how do i maintain this peace from god in the midst of all the madness going on in the world i want to show you how to do that number two is this you maintain the peace of god one of the ways you maintain the peace of god is through prayer look at philippians chapter four verse six through seven the bible says don't worry about anything instead pray about everything listen don't worry about it pray about it it goes on to say tell god your needs tell god your needs tell god what is heavy on your heart what's heavy on your mind tell god your struggles tell god your anxious thoughts it goes on to say and don't forget to thank him for his answers listen thank god for answering your prayers thank god for peace of mind and heart learn to thank god in advance come on thank god by faith thank him that peace is coming and that you will have peace and you're thankful that he is your peace god i thank you that you are my peace in the midst of the thorn the storm god i i thank you that you are my peace in the midst of covid and chaos god i thank you that you are my peace at that christmas dinner when my relatives start talking crazy and i want to smack them in the mouth but i'm not going to do it lord because i thank you that you gave me peace gotta i thank you i want to give them the side crazy eye like what are you but no i'm not gonna do it lord i'm gonna have peace because if they knew better they would do better and they're not taking my peace because you are my peace the prince of peace you you pray for peace and and it says this in verse 7 if you do this you will experience god's peace which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand and his peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and as rest as you trust in christ jesus the prince of peace let me show you another way you maintain the peace of god you maintain the peace of god by maintaining peace in your relationships let me explain look at romans chapter 12 verse 18 through 19. it says if it is possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone as far as it depends on you means it's not always possible to have peace in a relationship but your job is to do what you can do and leave the rest up to god do what you can do and leave the rest up to god as far as it depends on you you live at peace with everyone and if you will do your part you will have the peace of god even if the other person refuses to have peace in the relationship listen your peace isn't predicated on people people are not the prince of peace jesus is the prince of peace and if you'll follow his word he says listen as far as it depends on you not talking about them we get so focused on them jesus says i'm talking to you as far as it depends on you be at peace live at peace with everyone see if you honor god you will have the peace of god it goes on in verse 19 do not take revenge my dear friends but leave room for god's wrath for it is written it is mine to avenge i will repay says the lord your peace is not predicated on people it's not it's predicated on you honoring god by doing your best to live at peace with everyone well pastor how do i do that because these folks are getting on my nerves well let me help you as long as it depends on you don't get revenge as long as it depends on you don't talk bad about other people don't gossip don't tear down others don't try to get even come on follow jesus he's the prince of peace instead forgive love be kind be a person of peace and you will maintain the peace of god if you do your part to maintain peace in your relationships jesus is our peace honor him i'm telling you honoring jesus will bring you peace it'll help you maintain your peace and then number four how do we maintain the peace of god number four by honoring god with your life you maintain the peace of god by honoring god with your life look at romans chapter 8 verse 5 and 6. it says those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things but those who are controlled by the holy spirit think about things that please the spirit so letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death but letting the spirit control your mind leads to life and peace everybody say peace listen one of the quickest ways to lose the peace of god is to let your flesh control your mind instead of letting the holy spirit control your mind one of the quickest ways to lose your peace is to let your flesh control your life instead of letting the holy spirit control your life listen when you live a life of lying cheating gossiping sexual sin stealing jealousy greed hatred and hatred and bitterness you will forfeit the peace of god see some of you we are lacking peace in your life because of how you're living your life see living in sin leads to death sin kills our peace church hear me today don't forfeit the peace of god for temporary pleasure don't forfeit the peace of god for temporary pleasure honor god with your life i'm telling you when i was lost and i didn't know jesus i didn't have any peace and i was looking for it i looked to the bottle i looked at alcohol i looked to girls i looked to partying looking for peace and all i found was more problems but when it was when i finally surrendered my life to jesus i found peace i found hope [Music] i found forgiveness it was in the prince of peace yeah some of those things i was doing they brought some temporary peace and satisfaction but they also brought a whole lot more problems i found true peace in christ in christ alone and i'm believing somebody today you're gonna turn from your sin you're gonna turn to god you're gonna turn to jesus and he's gonna fill you with peace i believe some of you today you you were living for the lord and for whatever reason i don't know if you you feel flesh you let your flesh start controlling your life or maybe circumstances or life happened things happen and you turned away from god and you no longer have peace i believe something today you're going to turn back to the lord you're going to turn from your sin and he's going to fill you with peace don't go another day forfeiting the peace of god jesus is the prince of peace and if you will turn from your sin and you will turn for jesus his peace will invade your mind and your heart listen surrendering to jesus gives you peace with god and it gives you the peace of god
l-YMUc0_WJ0,well today we're kicking off our brand new series called winning and today i have my good friend he's going to come share the word god has given him a word he has a word for you this morning to speak to your heart i'll be back next week preaching but today i have my friend pastor matt willingham would you help welcome him to the stage he's got a word from god for you this morning and i'm excited for you to hear it hey come on can you keep your hands going for jesus this morning come on if you're glad of what he did if you're glad that he died on the cross for your sins so good to see you uh again many of you have seen you again some of some of you for the first time here at people's church and uh thank you pastor chris and his wife jamie can you give it up for pastor chris and miss jamie and the team here and their leadership pastor chris and jamie are great friends of of me and my family and uh he loves me even though i'm an alabama fan he loves me and uh don't boo don't boo i know i'm in big ten country but uh so but it's always good it's always good to be here at people's church and to see what god is doing and and this morning want to kind of just kick off this series that that we are in in 2022 to kick off the year winning how many of you like to win in life come on like to win in life right it's always good to win and uh a couple years ago several years ago my wife and i we took a trip we have three boys and we did the whole like hey uh we're gonna save up for a while take everyone to disney uh world and uh took everybody to disney and my middle son who's now a sixth grader at the time he was significantly younger he was terrified of roller coasters in his life and uh like wouldn't ride the small ones at the fair and i made it my goal that on this trip jeremiah we are going to win and we're going to ride a roller coaster for the first time and it'll be the most memorable thing you've ever done and you're going to overcome your fear so we walked around the park you know trying to find a good roller coaster and saw some of the bigger ones i'm like this is not the one to take him on the first time and and kind of found a smaller one i was like jeremiah this is it this is the roller coaster it's got your name on it and like a good parent i'm like i should videotape this because this is going to be awesome and uh i want you to watch my son jeremiah watch his expression on his roller coaster [Music] listen don't judge me don't judge my parenting skills right now no don't give him pity don't give him sympathy he's here today thank you jeremiah let me use that i i feel the harsh judgment till judgmental looks right now coming from all of you how dare you do that to that young man oh man it was the greatest day of my life i ain't gonna lie he's paid me back for it since then uh you know many of us could probably you know we look at that we laugh many of us can probably you ever had that day where you wake up and you're smiling you're like today's gonna be the day it's gonna be a good day it's gonna be a good week good month whatever it may look like and like instantly life smacks you in the face and then smiles turn into screams like get me off this ride right now get me out of this week right we've all been there and i think if we're honest with ourselves we we've had those days those months those weeks some of us have even unfortunately had those years before where things look out like they're going to be great things look like it's going to be awesome and all of a sudden it takes a turn for the worse all of a sudden it catches us off guard right now when i talk to people and you know it too when you talk to people many people in life feel like they're losing they feel like they're losing in the marriage they feel like they're losing in their dating life and their finances and their family some people feel like they're losing in their career their relationships and that losing has has made them and has made us to stop dreaming you feel like you're stuck you feel like you're lost it's kind of this helpless and hopeless feeling you ever been there before i mean i know what the word says pastor matt i know that god says i'm in i'm the head and not to tell and and i'm a conqueror and he's going to supply all of my needs according to his rituals i mean i can i could quote scripture after scripture and i can say man i want to win in life and i want to succeed and yet i find myself sometimes feeling like i'm losing maybe you felt like you lost last week maybe last month maybe last year maybe the last two years and and many times it's in those moments we have to we ask ourselves i mean is this really god what you have for me i mean is this everything you you have for me is this what you want me to accomplish is this what you want me to be and we feel like we've been losing for uh a long time but but what i do know as i know and i promise that this is not god's will for our life god's will is not that we lose god's will is not that we limp by through life matter of fact first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 says it like this don't you realize that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize so look at what it says so run two come on stay with me when come on can you say we run to win run to win and i think god and hands down when we look at this scripture god wants every one of us to run to win not to lose not to limp by not to barely make it he wants us to to run to win we're created to win god put inside of us the ability to win so the question is how do we start winning when we feel like we're losing how do we step into that fullness to everything that god has for us when we feel like life is overwhelming how do we step into everything god has for us what our marriage feels like is struggling when when i feel like as a mom and dad like i can't i can't raise my kids anymore and i'm i'm in the season where i'm struggling how do i step into what god has for me because last time i looked problems are everywhere amen problems are everywhere every person every relationship where i work where i go where i live and i find myself having problems everywhere and i find these things in my life taken away from the fullness that god has for me and these things often make me feel like losing and you want to know what often makes me feel like losing i put them for you on the screen it's just five things and they all start with the letter c change will make me feel like i'm losing how many of you you hate change i hate change change will make me feel like i'm losing conflict anybody had any conflict this week conflict will make me feel like i'm losing criticism concerns crisis all of those things in life will often come against us and will cause us to the point where we feel like we're losing this morning in judges chapter six if you've got your bibles turned there we're gonna look at a story about about a man about a nation that at a time in their life they felt like they were losing the nation of israel is going through a bunch of things they find themselves in captivity and and this young man by the name of gideon an angel of the lord comes to gideon and tells gideon get in you're the man you're the one that's going to lead the nation of israel out you're the one that's going to help the nation of israel be victorious and and you look at the story of gideon i think you and i can relate to him because it it's a story that focuses on his struggle to overcome fear stress and anxiety it's a story that that we know the nation of israel we know their story we know that it's god's people it's god's nation it's god's chosen chosen nation and yet they find themselves many times in their life losing even though they were meant to be winners and in judges chapter 6 the bible gives us their story in verse one through six it says the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord and for seven years he gave them unto the hands of the midianites and because of the power of midian was so oppressive the israelites prepared shelters for themselves and mountain cliffs caves and strongholds whenever the israelites planted their crops the midianites amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country they camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to gaza and did not spare a living thing for israel neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys they came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts it was look at what the bible says it was impossible to count them or their camels they invaded the land to ravage it and many and so impoverished to israelites that they cried out to the lord for hell here we see the nation of israel being ravaged being in a place in their life where they feel like they're losing honestly they probably are losing the odds are stacked up against them the enemy has surrounded them they find their resources being ravaged they find themselves being afraid and being fearful of the future and i often think even in my own life that that one of the main contributors one of the main things that will dominate my life when it comes to this idea and this and this moment in my life where i'm either stepping into the winning moments that god has for me are stepping into the losing moments that the enemy wants me to uh to to focus on one of the main contributors is is just simply that the things that will be controlled by fear the things that will be controlled by fear it's this domination of fear and i know what the word says i mean no second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 says that god did not give me a spirit of fear but of love joy and sound mind oh i can quote that but yet many times in my life i often find myself being driven and living by fear fear of the unknown fear of how is this going to work out fear of do i have enough and then what that fear does is then it will often then also cause me then to not only be fearful but because i'm fearful then i begin to feel all alone when nobody's ever went through this before i mean nobody else knows what i'm going through nobody else knows what it's like nobody else knows what my family is like nobody else know what it's like to raise kids and nobody else knows what it's like to go through these issues in my marriage nobody else knows what it's like to go to this school nobody else knows what it's like to be at this college come on you ever been there and we'll find ourselves feeling fearful and isolated and this is what i do though in order because i find myself i said well man well i got to win so what i need to do i need to manage my problems better i got to manage the issues around me i got to fix everything i i need to manage those situations i need to i need to try to manage the conflict better and the crisis better and all of these things but but what if i was to tell you this morning that that winning has nothing to do with how i eliminate my problems or how i handle my problems that winning has nothing to do with eliminating my problems um but it's more about managing my process that it's not about how do i eliminate because listen here's a news flash i got bad news for you if this is your first son in 2022 i hate to be negative but here's some bad news for you problems are not going to go away problems are not going to go away unless i do have one way to fix all of your problems and and i don't think it's a very good way but the only way to eliminate all your problems is very simple you won't know how just die that's how you eliminate all your problems just go to the grave now i don't know about you i have no desire to do that today i have no desire to exit this earth and so if if i'm not going to eliminate my problems then then what is it about it's about how do i manage my process because i think oftentimes in life when it comes to winning and it comes to succeeding you and i too many times focus on the problems when really we need to pay attention to the process that oftentimes the anxiety and stress and worry and fear will happen in my life not because of problems that are uncontrollable or unmanageable but just because simply my process needs to be adjusted and when we go to the word this morning i'm going to take you back to judges chapter 6 we we see that the israelites are in a serious situation they have problems they got a lot of problems a lot of things are going on right in their life their animals have been killed their crops are being trampled they find themselves being enslaved for for seven years i mean in chapter six israel is being stressed to the max isolation has become their defense mechanism the bible says that they're staying in mountain cliffs and in caves and an angel of the lord comes to this young man by the name of gideon says get in you're gonna be the leader you're gonna be the one that's gonna take israel and lead them and begin to let them begin to win and and even when gideon is found and i don't have time this morning to unpack all of this the bible says that he's found threshing wheat in a wine press in an underground cellar he himself is hiding he himself is fearful and the first thing again that stress will and anxiety will always attack in my life is is two things this fear of of losing my security and the fear of losing my supplies my my security of man i i'm afraid and i'm worried and i'm nervous am i am i everything that god wants me to be do i have everything that god wants me to be and the fear of my supply is so i just got to work harder and well if i'm going to win i got to do more and if i'm going to win i got to work harder and i got to i got to i got to put all of the gifts that i have in my life to work and really we just wear ourselves out so here is gideon here's the nation of israel just trying to get by and that's what the enemy wants us to do ultimately is make us feel like we're just barely making it oh i had enough joy for saturday and i hope i can get through on sunday my wife and i we made it through last week and man hopefully this week hopefully it'll be smooth selling i mean i made it through last semester in school man if i just if i just study hard and keep my head down and no problems happen maybe i'll just get through another semester and the enemy will just make us feel as if we're just trying to get by and that's not god is a plan for us to not to get by not to limp by not to just barely make it but this is what we do again we will pray we want god to come in and rush in and solve all of our problems oh and thank god he can like thank god he's a miracle worker thank god that he can show up in an instant thank god that he can heal my body when i need him to thank god that he does supply my needs according to his riches thank god that even when i'm not looking for it that he can show up in a moment of my life and just meet every need that i have and cause my problems to go away but again what if i was to overc what if i was to tell you that god is not as much concerned about removing your problems as he is about teaching you a new process if you want to win in 2022 it's about that process it's about the things that god wants to do in your life and through us see god is not just so much concerned about coming to our rescue he wants to renew us the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind not the rescuing of your problems be transformed by the renewing of your mind so god wants us to to re-evaluate and to do our process a little bit different so look i'm going to show you three things this morning that that god shows gideon in the nation of israel he's going to adjust their process and here's the first thing he adjusts it's the process of thinking different i like to call this the adjustment of my feelings in judges chapter 6 verse 15 through 16 the angel of the lord comes again and says get in you're going to be the leader you're going to be the one that takes us out but look at gideon's response he says to the angel part in my lord but but how can i save israel my clan is the weakest in manessa and i am the least in my family do you see what he's doing already the lord answered but i will be with you and you will strike down all the midianites leaving none alive the adjustment of my feelings the the process of thinking different the angel comes to him and says get in you're going to lead but he says but who am i i mean i'm nobody i mean i don't have anything and watch this all he did he he acknowledged who he was and where he came from his heritage that's what he acknowledged and he forgot about the hand of god that was on his life and often times in our life we'll come to these moments and again the enemy will have us thinking we're barely making it and we'll begin to say well i mean everybody in my family i mean i come from from a line of alcoholics so i just don't know if i'll ever kick this habit i mean it's kind of who we are i mean everybody in my family up to this point has got divorced and my mom and dad my mom and dad got divorced and their parents got divorced and so really kind of just a thing it runs you know marriages don't last in my family or hey everybody i come from my family everyone's broke in my family and we don't really come we're not very financially savvy people so maybe i'm just going to be broke do you see what we do we start just looking at all of the things that we have we start looking at our own background and our own heritage and a lot of times in my life those moments of losing will spike when i begin to focus on what i have and what i do not have because i begin to ask how am i going to do this do i have the power how am i going to make it how am i going to raise these kids what resources do i have what things can i put no how can i be a good parent how can i be a good husband and our thoughts will simply simply do this our thoughts can either assist us our thoughts can either help us and make us and assist us or that become a detriment to us because watch what he does he started second guessing himself and that led ultimately to him second guessing god he began to second guess himself and and that led to him second guessing god well i mean i don't know who i am and i you don't know where i come from and my background is totally different so how are you going to do anything with me and god's response was simple like listen i'm going to be with you like have you not forgot who i am it's the process of thinking different that maybe i don't have all the answers but i know the one who does maybe i don't have all the resources but i know the one who does maybe i do have some trials and some tribulations and i'm going through the storms but i know the one who can talk to the storm and cause calm in my life i know the one who can speak in a moment and cause everything to cease in my life the process of thinking difference and then he adjusts he shows them the process watch this a fighting difference i don't have time this morning to unpack this but judges chapter 6 verse 5 tells us how large the enemy was go read it again the bible says that they were so large it was impossible to even count all of them so gideon in judges chapter 7 does just like any of us would do let me go get everybody i can to help i'm gonna put it out on facebook take a picture on instagram there's the enemy anybody wanna sign up meet me at the creek i'll holler at you we'll give you instructions so he has everyone he can sign up and 32 thousand people show up and i'll be honest if i was getting up like okay we can do some damage 32 000 people let's go right the lord said to gideon in chapter seven verse two though you have too many men i cannot deliver getting a midian into their hands or israel will boast against me my own strength has saved me so watch what he says now announce to the army anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave mount gilead so i can imagine getting all right y'all hey anybody who's afraid go ahead go on back home and i can i was getting but like all right maybe a couple hundred people you might leave you soft anyways we don't want you anyways just go ahead and go on home but the bible says watch 22 000 men left if i was getting like hold up i mean did y'all hear me really well like i mean if you're a little afraid you can stay but like a lot of afraid like go ahead leave 20 22 000 men and ten thousand remains so i can imagine gideon's like okay ten thousand cool we can still do something with this but look god's got jokes but the lord said to gideon there are still too many men take them down to the water and i will thin them out for you there let me jump down to verse 7. the lord said to gideon with 300 men that laughed i will save you and give the midianites into your hands i'll let all the others go home 32 000 shows up he's going to go into battle with 300. i like to call this the adjustment of my friends the people i go into battle with in 2022 will help me determine if i'm going to win or if i'm going to lose and listen hear me this morning i don't just mean getting rid of all the unsaved people in my life because sometimes there's some good church folk i need to get out of my life they're not here they're they're at the first service they're not here there's at the first turn this service is good there's some people in my life listen that sometimes i gotta be willing to cut ties with we think it's all about listen so this is what we do in our life when we face trials and obstacles we think it's just about getting as many people as we can to come to our rescue getting as many people as we can to get on our side i know y'all have never done that before but you ever went to social media and tried to get your side of the story out first when something happened you need to start looking through all the comments and you see like okay they got my back they got my back okay that one you're okay i ain't talking to you anymore you ain't got my back okay that one's got my back you you gotta like get the first one out you gotta be get the story out so you can surround yourself with as many people gideon does exactly that 32 000 people show up and i'll be honest when i face difficulties and when i face circumstances i always thought it was just about man just surround myself with a bunch of people get as many people as i can around me not to realize that sometimes there's some of those people i don't need for me in that moment in my life but guess what there's some people that don't really have the best out for me some people don't want to see you succeed some people don't want to see your marriage fulfilled some people don't want to see your kids raised on fire for god loving him and chasing after everything that god has for him and i look at that story though and i always thought i always thought like the premise of what god did 32 000 or 300 was simple i mean the bible says it that it was just about making the army small because god's like yo if y'all go win with 32 000 you're going to boast about yourself but if you win with 300 of course you're going to give me the credit and you look at the word and that's that's a big thing but but i looked at it again and did you see the two groups of people that was cut the first group of people were people that was afraid those are the ones that left in droves and watch the second group of people were those people who let their guard down because he told him to go down to the river you go read the story this week and he says tell them to get a drink and and the bible says that there was some men they got on their hands and their knees or they got on their knees and their hands and they drunk out of the out of the lake out of the river they drunk like a dog like lapping it up and when they did that their eyes had lost focus of what was going around them they could not see everything that was happening and then the 300 men was those who went and scooped up the water and brought it up to their face and they drank it like this which means their eyes stayed up to the enemy their eyes stayed up to what was going on around them and i think the correlation for you and i is to realize is we got to have people around us listen i don't want people around me that are going to be fearful of what's going on is our world crazy are things changing absolutely but i do know one thing i do know i serve a god who is still in control i do know one thing i serve a god who the bible tells me that at the end of all of this we win anyways i don't need people who are afraid and i need people around me who are aware of what's going on who can see things or who can even come to me and say math man i notice this attitude in your life it's not good let me pray for you let me help you win in this area of your life i need people around me that are going to come and help support what god has for me going to help me win so he shows us that the the process of fighting different and then they'll watch it's the process of worshiping difference because in judges chapter 6 bible tells us in verse 25 that same night the lord said to him he's talking to gideon take the second bull from your father's heard the one seven years old tear down your father's altar to baal and cut down the asherah pole beside it it was idol worship the nation of israel had found themselves in trouble because god had had been misplaced and he wasn't in the in the part of their life like like he had asked him to be and commanded them to be he says tear this down verse 26 then build a proper kind of altar to the lord your god on on the top of his height using the wood from the shearer pole that you cut down offer the second bull as a burnt offering the process of worshiping different i'd like to call this the adjustment of my focus the nation of israel had found themselves in trouble because they had lost focus on where god should have been in their life that they had let themselves become distracted the enemy had them so afraid they found themselves worshiping these these false idols gideon he passes this first test of faith before he even goes into battle he he passes his first test of faith by tearing down this false god that had been built by his father he said listen if we're going to win if if this nation is going to succeed we've got to learn how to first put god back in the right place that he deserved to be they didn't wait till the battle was over and then said they were all right we're going to worship god they worship god before the battle even began they they knew the power was in their praise they knew that the power was what was going to come out of their mouth and who they was going to serve and oh i think that's why the enemy fights just so hard when it comes to our worship when it comes to our praise it's because when we get to church and we get around church people or when we're in our car and that worship music is on when we begin to worship god and lift up our voice our focus and our attention it goes away from our problems our focus and our attention goes away from things that are around us and we begin to remind ourselves listen i know a god and i have a father who loves me and who cares for me and who is in control and our as our worship is released our faith gets strengthened so they worship god they they put him back in the right place spoiler alert if you haven't read the story we know how the story ends they go to battle with 300 men they they attack the camp by surprise it's a surprise attack the midnight camp they fall into panic and in spite of this weak leader with a small army with these foolish weapons of trumpets and torches that's how they went to battle israel wins because they put god in the right spot their focus and their attention and oftentimes listen hear me this morning i mean here's the nation of israel everything was stacked against them the problems had mounted they they felt like they were losing they they felt like they had no control and maybe you came in this place this morning and you feel like that you've been losing this past week you've been losing last year you've been losing last month you said pastor matt i don't know i don't know if i could carry on i don't know if i can keep on going i don't know if i have what it takes listen put your attention back on god put your focus back on who is in control because what i've come to find out is oftentimes when i feel like i'm on the edge of losing it i could just be on the verge of my breakthrough when i feel like i'm on the edge of i don't know if i can go on that's when god shows up in my life and he reaches down and he does a miracle and he does something amazing in my life see we will have to understand hear me this morning church that the biblical response to winning ultimately fosters a dependence upon our heavenly father if we're really going to win in 2022 if we're really going to be everything that god called me to be as a mom as a dad as a student as a husband as a wife as a grandma as a grandpa that god listen he's not so much concerned about the problems that you're facing but will you let him adjust your process oh he's not worried about delivering on his part the question is will you deliver on your part what will you deliver on the things that that you can do because if i really believe what the what i read in the bible i mean think about it if i really believe what the word says and i believe i do i believe you do that that god is the one who delivers god is the one who provides god is the one who saves he is the one who heals he is the one who shows up time and time again he is the one who can calm the storms listen all i need to do is just surrender to him and trust him oh but it's a process all i need to do is be obedience be obedient to his commands in my life be obedient to his will in my life it's not so much about oh pastor matt i got to get rid of my problems no i need to adjust my process what if i was to tell you that the nation of israel and even this morning that the stress and the anxiety that it's not coming from your problems that you're facing the fear the worry this this sense of man i'm losing it's not coming from the problems in your life that you're facing and i'm not negating what we may be facing this morning but it's coming from the process we're living by so i want to give you two steps this morning two things crucial in obedience to god then as we as we put god in his right place as we surrender to him we want to win this year in 2022. here's the first thing i want you to write down simply this seek god first see god first matthew chapter 6 verse 33 it says it just like this but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and what and all and what and all these things will be given to you see seek first 21 days of prayer and fasting coming up here at people's church seek seek first the kingdom of god i'm going to go after god for that lost kid i'm going to go after god for my marriage i'm going to go after god for my friends and my loved ones that don't know christ i want to go after god for for for the things that he has me seek first the kingdom of god and as i seek him he begins to unlock he begins to open up he begins to to pour out his blessings on my life and not only do i need to seek first here's the second thing write it down i need to just keep going just keep going your problems aren't going to quit but that doesn't mean you do the enemy won't stop attacking but that doesn't mean you give in and just surrender to him just keep going first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24-27 i read one of the verses earlier but let me read it all it says do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize so run in such a way to get the prize everyone who completes who competes in the games goes into strict training they do it to get a crown that will not last all but i love this but we do it to get a crown that will last forever therefore i do not run like someone running aimlessly oh i got a point i got a i got a place i got to be i got a point in life i got a purpose that i'm running for is what he's saying i do not fight like a boxer beating the air no i strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after i have preached to others i myself will not be disqualified for the prize listen this morning i don't know what you come in facing i don't know what you came in this morning and maybe you feel like you've been losing yesterday or today or maybe this past week but listen god is not a god to just rush in and solve all your problems but he does want to adjust your process would you let him adjust your process this morning would you be obedient will you seek god first will you keep going come on i want you to right where you're sitting i want you to bow your heads i want to pray for you god i thank you for your word this morning god i thank you lord for every mom every dad every god every student god in this place every grandma every grandpa god that came in and god i know lord in this place so we walked in and there's problems that we're facing or are there situations that seem unfavorable but god i know that you are greater and more than you are bigger so god we pray this morning god don't just remove our problems but god adjust our process god maybe we need to think different god maybe it's the people around us god that we need to look at god maybe it's just lord it's just a mere fact that we need to just surrender to you we need to put you back in the right place in our life so god i pray would you do that today gotta adjust our process god help us or to be obedient to you god help us or to seek you god help us or to not lord quit to not give in lord we thank you for lord in jesus mighty name amen
hMr_razdQhw,but today the title of my message is how do I know if I'm possessed or oppressed by demons we're going to learn about demon possession and Demon oppression today you know our world is highly intrigued and fascinated by the Demonic by wickedness and evil in our world I mean just think about movies there are so many movies about the Demonic and wickedness in 1973 the movie The Exorcist came out there a movie called Poltergeist lots of movies The Conjuring Annabelle the Blair Witch Project the ring Rosemary's Baby Chucky I never understood that one I would punt that doll let that little doll come close to me I'm telling you right now get out 10 A Nightmare on Elm Street Halloween Friday the 13th I I still get a little freaked out when I hear I never understood how Jason caught people how they can Jason walked y'all can't run fast and then they always tripped and F it made no s made no sense to me but the point I want to make is that for many people Hollywood has shaped in their mind what demon possession or oppression looks like but what we want to do today is we're going to find out what the Bible says first let me say the church in many ways has made talking about about demons or casting out demons something that's very weird you know only crazy weird and wild Christians talk about demons or casting out demons and that's such a wrong perspective that the devil wants you to believe so that you stay uninformed about the Demonic world and so I want to teach you a few things today first casting out demons was a vital part of Jesus's Ministry confronting casting out demons was a normal part of the ministry of Jesus it was common it wasn't something that just crazy and weird people did it was a normal part of Jesus's Ministry Jesus casted out demons so that people could experience freedom and true life look at Matthew 4:24 it says news about him spread all over Syria and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases those sufferings severe pain the demon possessed those having seizures and the paralyzed and he healed them Matthew 8:16 when evening came many who were demon-possessed were brought to him and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick Matthew 9:32 while they were going out a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus Matthew 12:22 then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute and Jesus healed them so that he could both talk and see Matthew 15:22 a Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out Lord son of David have mercy on me my daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly casting out demons was a normal part of Jesus's Ministry and I want you to be aware of some of the symptoms the characteristics of someone who is possessed by a demon here are some superhuman strength or superhuman knowledge a a different voice speaking loss of voice isolation the inability to control oneself some of you just thought about your child you're it's the sugar okay it's just the sugar too much self harm sometimes severe sickness erratic Behavior a hatred towards Jesus and an intent to disrupt anything Godly casting out demons was a regular part of the early Church's Ministry we find this in Acts 516 acts 87 acts 16 verse 16-18 and acts 1912 and I wonder why was it a part of their Ministry and I think Timothy says It Best in 2 Timothy CH 2 vers 25- 26 it says opponents must be gently instructed in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil who has taken them captive to do his will the devil's goal is to take people captive to do his will as Christians we want to see people set free from the power of the devil so that they can do God's will secondly I want to answer the question can Christians be demon-possessed I want to show you some biblical principles to answer this question first Jesus taught that demons look for unoccupied people Matthew 12 verse 43-45 when an impure Spirit comes out of a person it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it then it says I will return to the house I left when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order then it goes and takes with it seven other Spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there and the final condition of that person is worse than the first this is how it will be with this wicked generation demons look for people who are not occupied by the Holy Spirit people who are not occupied by the Holy Spirit are a candidate to be demon-possessed secondly Christians are occupied with the Holy Spirit when a person gives their life to Jesus when they make Jesus their lord and savior immediately the Holy Spirit occupies the Christian Romans Chap 88:9 and 10 it says but you are not controlled by your sinful nature you are controlled by the spirit if you have the spirit of God living in you and remember that those who do not have the spirit of Christ Living in them do not belong to him at all and Christ lives within you so even though your body will die because of sin the spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God 1 Corinthians 3:16 don't you realize that all of you together are the the temple of God and that the spirit of God Lives in You 1 Corinthians 6:19 do you know that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you've received from God you are not your own Christians have the Holy Spirit living inside of us so we cannot be occupied or possessed by a demon Spirit demon Spirits look for and possess bodies that are not occupied by the Holy Spirit thirdly Christians are instructed to resist the devil Christians are instructed to resist the devil not to cast The Devil out of ourselves you can't resist the devil if you are possessed by him but Christians can resist the devil because we're not possessed by the devil James 4:7 it says submit yourselves then to God resist the devil and he will flee from from you 1 Peter 5:8-9 be alert and of sober mind your enemy the devil prows around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour resist him standing firm in the faith you can resist the devil because you are not possessed by the devil number three let's answer the question can Christians be demon oppressed now while Christians cannot be possessed by by a demon we can be tormented harassed or oppressed by demons even severely oppressed or harassed so don't confuse demon oppression with demon possession simply put demon oppression is a prolonged consistent outside spiritual attack from the devil demon possession takes place on the inside and the person is being controlled by the devil to do his will possession is about ownership oppression is about influence okay but demon oppression can cause a person to have an extreme amount of fear anxiety worry negative thoughts feeling weighed down heavy depressed and oppressed and although demons don't possess Christians all right if a Christian continues to to allow a demon to have access into their life that demon can gain access that it will literally start controlling the Christian's life now this isn't possession but it's severe oppression listen I I've had times in my life where I was being oppressed by the devil there have been times where I've given the devil access into areas of my life and I felt this heaviness I felt weighed down I felt depressed I was being influenced and oppressed by the enemy the majority of the time when someone is severely harassed or oppressed by the devil it's because they're making poor decisions and giving the devil access into their life but there are times a Christ follower is being severely harassed by the devil and it's not because of their poor choices sometimes God allows a Christian to experience demonic oppression to keep them humble and close to Jesus look what happened with Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:7 it says or because of these surprisingly great Revelations therefore in order to keep me from becoming seeded I was given a thorn in my flesh a messenger of Satan to torment me to torment me Paul was a man of God he loved God he was following the Lord and yet he was being harassed by the devil sometimes the Lord will allow one of his children to be harassed by a demon for their own spiritual benefit okay and and it's a good thing to be harassed by the devil because you're following Jesus with all of your heart but it's a horrible thing to be harassed and oppressed by demons because you're giving the enemy access into your life by your own poor decisions most people who were severely harassed and oppressed by demons is due to their own poor choices they're giving demons access into their life and so I want to share with you seven ways you are giving demons access into your life seven ways you are giving demons access into your life number one is this sinful anger look at Ephesians chapter 4 verse 26 and 27 in your anger do not sin do not let the sun go down while you are still angry and do not give the the devil a foothold don't give the devil a foothold in your life wh what's a foothold you ever been in your house and you're maybe playing tag or or maybe you went up to your bigger brother and sister and you bopped them in the head and then all of a sudden they're chasing you and they're coming to get you and you're going to go run into your room to close the door and lock it and you get in your room and you're going to slam your door and boom their foot goes in between the door and it stops it from closing and now there's this crack and your old big brother sisters like yeah pop me upside my head you know what I mean you know what I'm saying that's what a foothold is the devil wants to have his foot in the door of your life so there's a a crack so he can he can get in and get access into areas of your life that's what a foothold is and one of the ways you give the devil access is when your anger turns into sin see the Bible says the emotion of anger isn't a sin but it can easily turn into sin and if your anger leads to sin you're giving the devil a foothold into your life so don't let your anger get out of control don't explode on people don't Punch walls don't say mean or hurtful things don't stay angry for days and weeks your anger has to have an expiration date the Bible says don't let the sun go down while you're angry scripture is giving us a principle that we need to deal with our Ang anger quickly don't stay angry deal with it so that you don't give the devil a foothold slam the door closed so the devil does not have access and your life number two is unforgiveness Ephesians 4:26 through 27 is also referring to unforgiveness deal with your anger by forgiving people so that you don't give the devil a foothold some of you you're giv demons access into your life because you won't forgive 2 Corinthians 2: 10 and 11 it says anyone you forgive I also forgive and what I have forgiven if there was anything to forgive I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake in order that Satan might not out witht us for we are not unaware of his schemes Satan is outwitting some of you and he is destroying your relationships and your peace of mind because you're not forgiving you have to forgive you have to let it go or the devil's going to keep outwitting you he's going to keep wreaking havoc on in your life and in your relationships today slam the door closed on the devil number three is exposing yourself to deceiving Spirits first Timothy 4:1 the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons when Believers start participating in witchcraft Ouija boards the occult cultic ceremonies demonic sacrifices and false religions they open themselves up to demonic spirits don't expose yourself to these deceiving Spirits because they will have you believing lies and they will drag you far away from the Lord you have to also watch out for false teaching and false religions because they will pull you away from Jesus 2 Corinthians 11:3 and 4 it says but I fear that somehow your pure and undivided Devotion to Christ will be corrupted just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent you happily put up with whatever anyone tells you even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach or a different kind of spirit than the one you received or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed hear me today don't listen to people that are preaching a different Jesus you got to follow Jesus of the Bible don't follow other Spirits except the Holy Spirit you got to watch out for teaching and false religions number four number four is movies music and social media you have to be careful about the movies and music you watch and listen to you can give the devil a foothold in your life by what you watch and listen to you can give the devil access into your life by filling your mind with all kinds of sexual immorality hatred violence Wicked and demonic movies and music when you pump your mind full of Filth you are opening the door to the Demonic you know sometimes I'm just trying I'm just trying to watch the game you know what I mean I'm just trying to watch football game basketball game I like sports and it goes to commercials and I look up and I'm like oh that is not of the Lord like you know what I mean like they want to make all these movies and they showing the previews to it and I'm like m not in the name of Jesus new we not we not looking and watching some of that right now got got to Shield our kids eyes sometimes what you watch and listen to can be demonically influenced that's why the Bible says in Matthew 622 through 23 it says the eye is the lamp of the body so if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light but if your eye is B B your whole body will be full of Darkness if then the light in you is in is Darkness How great is the darkness be careful what you watch and listen to so that your whole body isn't full of Darkness 2 Corinthians 10:5 it says we demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ take captive every thought and slam the door on the devil number number five is being idle and a busy body 1 Timothy 5: 13-15 it says besides they get into the habit of being Idol and going about from house to house and not only do they become idlers but also busy bodies who talk nonsense saying things they ought not to so I counsel younger widows to marry to have children to manage their homes and to give to to give the enemy no opportunity for slander some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan and so in this scripture here Paul's writing to Timothy about some women that had become busy body and they turned away from Jesus and they started following Satan Church the only thing we need to be busy with is busy with the work of the Lord amen you need to be busy with the work of the Lord rather than being idle and meddling in other people's business spreading gossip and causing division the old saying an idle mind is the devil's workshop has some truth to it God created you on purpose for a purpose you need to be busy doing God's purpose working hard at your job or in school taking care of your family sharing your faith serving at church don't give the devil an opportunity to gain access into your life by being Idol and meddling in other people's business you got a SL Lam the door on the Devil by focusing on living out your god-given purpose number six is lying and deception ananas and saf gave the devil access into their life by lying and deceiving the church acts 5:3 then Peter said ananas how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you've lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept yourself some of the money you received for the land some of you are constantly lying and deceiving people and you're giving the devil access into your life and he is causing chaos in your life come on you got to slam the door on the devil and stop lying and deceiving you need to break free from lying today in Jesus name and then number seven living in sin James 4:7 says submit yourselves then to God resist the devil and he he will flee from you when Christians resist the devil he flees from you but if you don't resist the devil he doesn't flee oh he going to hang around he will hang around as long as you will allow him to he will hang around gain access into your life and he will start destroying your life sin is so destructive it takes you further than you want to go it keeps you longer than you want to stay and cost you more than you want to pay let me say that again rewind takes you further than you want to go keeps you longer than you want to stay and cost you more than you want to pay 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1-5 it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate a man is sleeping with his father's wife and you are proud shouldn't you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this for my part even though I am not physically present I'm with you in spirit as one who is present with you in this way I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this so when you are assembled I am with you in spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus is present hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his Spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord sexual sin it opens the door for Satan to work in your life the Bible teaches that sex God's way is between one man and one woman in the confines of a marriage relationship and when we don't do things God's way it gives the devil a foothold into your life it's important for you to understand that living with any sin in your life not just sexual sin it opens the door for the devil to work in your life first John 38 it says the one who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning the reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work the Son of God came to destroy the devil's work the Bible says the devil came to steal kill and destroy Jesus said I came so that you may have life and you may have it to the full I'm here to tell you today that the the the only grip the enemy has on your life is the one you allow don't give him any access don't let him have a foothold no no no God wants to help you kick his foot out and slam the door on every lie every deception every attack from the enemy today Jesus wants to help you close the door on the devil and his demons
Vp0eRa2z6H8,well today we are wrapping up our series called good God and the title of my message today is I will see the goodness of God I will see the goodness of God our theme scripture for this Series has been Psalm 34 8. it says taste and see that the Lord is good this series we've talked about that there's a lot of people that feel like maybe when life is harder that they're challenging that God is not good or maybe God has abandoned them or maybe God is bad and it's important that you know that God is good all the time and all the time God is good and there are reasons why people don't taste and see the goodness of God and in this series we've been talking about those so in week one we talked about one of the reasons why people don't taste and see the goodness of God is because they have a wrong perspective of God when it comes to trials trouble trauma and Temptation that God does not cause any of those things but in his goodness God will use those things to strengthen us and develop our character in our faith God does not tempt us but God will always give us a way out of Temptation because God is always good and God has this massive table of goodness but just because God has the table doesn't mean we'll experience that table of goodness we have to taste and see week two we talked about another reason why people don't taste and see the goodness of God is because they don't step out in faith God won't force you to taste and see his goodness God won't Force his goodness on you you got to take a step of faith and be obedient to God's word to experience all his goodness for your life and then we last week we talked about another reason why people don't taste and see the goodness of God is because they get spiritual amnesia because they've forgotten about the goodness of God and so if you missed any of those messages please go on our YouTube page on YouTube look at people's Church Indianapolis and you can watch any one of those messages and today I want to talk about a fourth reason people don't taste and see the goodness of God and here it is so many people don't believe they'll see the goodness of God matter of fact some of you been here all three weeks of this series hear me preach about the goodness of God and some of you still don't believe that you will see the goodness of God in your life you believe other people will see the goodness of God but you don't believe that you will and I'm here to tell you today you have to believe it you have to believe it look what David said in Psalm 27 13. he said I would have lost heart unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of living David said I would have given up I would have quit I would have stopped moving forward I would have lost hope I would have given up on my dreams I would have given up on life if I didn't believe I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living the NIV says it like this Psalm 27 13 I will remain confident of this I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living no matter what happens in life you have to remain confident that you will see the goodness of the Lord that's what faith is all about that no matter what happens in life I believe God will bless my life Hebrews 11 6 it says and without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe everybody say believe anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him you have to believe that God rewards those who earnestly seek him that God pours out his goodness on those who seek him and so today I want to give you four things you have to believe about the goodness of God four things you have to believe about the goodness of God number one here's what you got to believe you have to believe I will see the goodness of God in spite of what I see I will see the goodness of God in spite of what I see David was facing some gigantic problems when he wrote these words some scholars believe that David was running for his life David had been anointed by the prophet Samuel to be king the next king of Israel and King Saul was jealous of David and so he sent his whole Army after David King Saul sent his army out on a Sikh and destroy mission find David and kill him and David said in spite of this crazy King pursuing me in spite of hiding from the Army in spite of what I'm seeing right now I believe I will see the goodness of God I believe God's promises to me will be fulfilled I believe I will still be the next king of Israel even though I don't see how it will happen David said in spite of what I said see I believe I will see the goodness of God and David was seeing some massive problems y'all look at Psalm 27 verse 2 through 3. it says when the wicked Advance against me to devour me it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall David was being pursued by his enemies but he said in spite of what I currently see I believe I will see the goodness of God I will see my enemies stumble in Fall verse 3 though an army besieged me my heart will not fear the War break out against me even then I will be confident David said war is breaking out against me nothing is going my way I don't see how Victory will happen but I will remain confident that I will see the goodness of God I will see the goodness of God Psalm 27 5 it says for in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent and set me high upon a rock David said in the day of trouble I still believe I will see the goodness of God Psalm 27 6 he says then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me David said I'm surrounded by enemies but I still believe I will see the goodness of God People's Church no matter what you see you need to believe you will see the goodness of God in your life and listen I know you're seeing a lot happening around you covid sickness inflation instability in the stock market your 401k is down Investments are down divisive political elections interest rates are rising your car broke down your relationships are struggling your kids are making bad decisions you got a bad doctor's report but no matter what you see you have to believe that you will see the goodness of God come on say it with me now I will see the goodness of God come on say it with me I will see the goodness of God one more time I will see the goodness of God got to believe it in spite of what I see I will see the goodness of God number two Let me give you the second thing you need to believe I will see the goodness of God in spite of what I feel I will see the goodness of God in spite of what I feel like any human being David had so many most emotions as he faced so much trouble in his life but he talked about his emotions through eyes of faith look what he says in Psalm 27 1 the Lord is my light in my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall I be afraid David faced the emotion of fear he was afraid but he had Faith look at Psalm 27 3 though an army besieged me my heart will not fear the War break out against me even then I will be confident David said to his emotions that the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear Whom Shall I be afraid have you ever been afraid and talked to yourself anybody ever been there you've been afraid you start talking to yourself where are my roller coaster fans or I go where my roller coaster folks you love say okay I got some roller coaster folks in here man I love Kings Island I love Cedar Point I love roller coasters I can ride on them again and again and over and over especially the new ones the old ones I don't know so much they rattle me around and hurt my back but oh man I want to ride where I love riding roller coasters and I've I've rarely been afraid to ride one a a roller coaster and ride it again and again and again but there is one there was one roller coaster while I was waiting in line my knees started to buckle though I was waiting in line I started thinking should I start making up lies y'all my stomach's not feeling so good maybe I should sit I mean I really want to ride it but you know if something's not I started thinking about do I need to start faking a headache oh hey something's going on like I I'm watching this roller coaster and my knees are buckling and my stomach is churning it was a first to like Hey Y'all sure guys man two hours man you really wanna I mean if you guys wanna do it I'm cool I mean hey I'm really excited but you know if you don't want to wait I'm good and yeah there was just one roller coaster had me scared it's called the dragster it says Cedar Point if you've never heard of the dragster or aren't aware of it I have a picture it is the yellow one it is the yellow one it's at Cedar Point I believe it has one of the biggest drops in the world and it's a roller coaster that you sit on it and they call the dragster because like a drag race so you're sitting still and then it just shoots you out you you go from zero to 120 miles per hour in six seconds and then it shoots you up 400 not 400 400 feet and while you're waiting in line every once in a while when it shoots somebody up it doesn't make it over the hump and they come right back down I'm like oh oh yeah y'all sure you won't do this I mean I'm good if you're good but it shoots you up 400 feet and then it drops you for man my stomach was y'all as soon as they strapped me and I'm like the Lord is my light and my salvation the Lord is the strong hey you sure this is buckled in right like I I know the Lord is my stronghold but hey can we can we get a double triple check over here I'm like the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I be afraid oh Jesus Lord help me live and survive this thing and all of a sudden it suits you and you're like songs oh and I made it and it was one and only one and only I did it I don't ever need to do it again matter of fact I just read an article that they just retired the dragster may he rest in peace may he rest come on sometimes you got to talk to your emotions the Lord is my light the Lord is my stronghold of my life David had to talk to his emotions look at Psalm 27 9 he says do not hide your face from me and do not turn your servant away in Anger you have been my helper look what he says he says do not reject me or forsake me God my savior Dave and even had feelings of being abandoned by God God where are you God why am I going through all of this but David said in spite of how I'm feeling I am confident that I will see the goodness of the Lord People's Church I know some of you are encountering so many emotions in this season depressed anxious overwhelmed fearful afraid scared lonely confused discombobulated abandoned but in spite of your feelings you need to believe that you will see the goodness of God in the land of the living come on say with me I will see the goodness of God I will see the goodness of God you've got to believe you got to believe here's the third thing you need to believe I will see the goodness of God in spite of what they do I will see the goodness of God In Spite of what they do David understood something a lot of Christians don't understand and that is he would see the goodness of the Lord in spite of what other people did to him he understood that people didn't control his Destiny no matter what people did to him they couldn't stop him from experiencing the goodness of God listen to what David's enemies were doing to him Psalm 27 verse 2 and 3 he says when the wicked Advance he had Wicked people advancing against him trying to devour him to devour me verse three he says though an army besieges me the War break out against me in Psalm 26 7 he says then my head will be exalted above all the enemies who surround me Psalm 27 10. he says though my father and mother forsake me the Lord will receive me David said even if my father and mother forsake me they can't stop me from experiencing the goodness of God Psalm 27 12 he says do not turn me over to the desire of my foes for false witnesses rise up against me spouting malicious accusations in spite of his enemies trying to kill him War breaking out against him his enemies surrounding him and people lying on him David was confident that people could not stop him from experiencing the goodness of God matter of fact David was so convinced that people could not stop him from experiencing the goodness of God that he didn't kill Saul when he had the opportunity I want you to see how confident David was in the truth that God was in control of his Destiny not people and you know in first Samuel 24 uh David and his men come up on Saul sleeping Saul they've been searching for David to kill him and they took a nap they fell asleep and there is David right now he has this opportunity and look what it says in verse 4 it says the men said this is the day the Lord spoke of when he said to you I'll give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe I mean I know he could have been cutting up a whole lot more he could have killed that King that was trying to kill him verse 5 says afterward David was conscious stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe he said to his men the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed or lay my hand on him for he is the anointed of the Lord David said I will not touch the Lord's anointed because I trust God to deal with this evil King I trust God to promote me to be next king I don't need to promote myself this King can't stop me from experiencing the goodness of God People's Church you need to know that no enemy no person no devil can stop you from experiencing the goodness of God your enemies don't control your destiny people don't control your destiny God does the Bible says no weapon formed again come on in your best friend Hammond voice no weapon formed against me no weapon formed against you will prosper if God wants you to be the king you don't have to kill the king you don't have to talk bad about your enemies get even with your enemies people can't stop the plan of God God knows how to promote you and bless you you just have to honor God you got to be faithful to God hear me today you are the only one who can stop you from experiencing the goodness of God you're the only one that can stop you from experiencing the goodness of God people can't stop you honor God and then number four the fourth thing you need to believe I will see the goodness of God because of my faith in God David knew he would see the goodness of God because his faith was in God David was a God Chaser David was dependent on God he was leaning on God God was first in David's life Psalm 27 1 he says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall I be afraid David said I will see the goodness of God because I trust God people who see the goodness of God are people that trust God no matter what God I trust you no matter what I see Psalm 27 6 it said at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of Joy I will sing and make music to God David said I will see the goodness of God because I worship God people who see the goodness of God worship God no matter what God I worship you no matter what I see Psalm 27 7 it says hear my voice when I call Lord be merciful to me and answer me David said I will see the goodness of God because I pray to God people who see the goodness of God they pray to God no matter what God I pray no matter what I see Psalm 27 8 my heart says of you seek his face your face Lord I will seek David said I'll see the goodness of God because I seek God's face David sought the face of God not just the hand of God he didn't just want the blessings of God he wanted intimacy with God he wanted to know God more and more and people who see the goodness of God they seek God's face not just his hand they don't just want the blessings of God they want God himself they want to know God more and more Psalm 27 11 it says teach me your way Lord lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors David said I will see the goodness of God because I follow God see people who see the goodness of God they follow God's word and the leading of the Holy Spirit no matter what I follow God's word and the leading of the Holy Spirit Psalm 27 14 it says wait for the Lord be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord everybody say wait David said I will see the goodness of God because I am waiting on the Lord people who see the goodness of God wait on the Lord the real test of your faith is will you wait on God no matter what you see will you wait on God no matter what you feel will you wait on God no matter what they do that's the real test of our faith is will you wait on God no matter what you see what you feel or what people do to you listen hear me today waiting isn't passive waiting on God is active waiting on God is active it requires

VomuS2qqUwc,we hope you'll continue to be here um because during that time we're also going to uh still be in this series stay in your lane preparing for your purpose everybody say stay in your lane stay in your lane the title of my message today is how to prepare for your purpose how to prepare for your purpose last week we started this series stay in your lane preparing for your purpose and we study the life of David and we learned that David had a deep conviction that he was created by God and that God had a plan and purpose for his life we learned that David focused on living out God's purpose for his life not on position or promotion or prominence he deeply trusted God's plan for his life David believed that what God had for him was for him and that as long as he followed God nobody could stop God's plan and purpose for his life and just like David God created you and God has a plan and purpose for your life I want that to get deep in your heart God has ordained opportunities jobs promot tions and people for your life and if you're going to trust God with your life and not just with eternity your eternity you have to have a deep conviction that God has a plan and purpose for your life but most people trust themselves more than they trust God they don't follow God's plan they follow their plan plan their life is focused on the wrong things they they they're focusing on trying to get a position instead of God's purpose they're focused on a promotion or power or prominence or Prestige instead of on God's purpose and when you focus on the wrong things it will keep you from living out God's purpose for your life I don't know if any of you did this when you were little but I could remember when I was in elementary school maybe seven eight or nine I used to like to get into my mom or dad's car and act like I was driving you know matter of fact my dad had a stick [Music] so you know what I mean anybody do that when they were little I the only one I just when I was little boy I could not wait to drive I had dreams of driving remember being 14 and 15 begging my mom come on Mom Mom let me drive let me drive let me drive let me drive and we actually in our neighborhood we had a a a it had a circle it had a circle and my mom's like okay I'll let you drive around the circle I'mma drive around the circle y'all I knew what I was doing using my right foot on the gas and using my left foot on the brake oh oh y'all yeah that's not how you drive just in case you didn't know but all she I'm like I'm ready for the highway come on Mom let me go life is a highway I mean I was ready know you drive around this circle there's some things I needed to learn I wasn't ready my mom knew I was not ready for the highway even though I had this dream in my heart I wasn't prepared have you ever had a dream in your heart that you thought you were prepared for and then it happened you realize you weren't as prepared as you thought you were maybe you were dating someone thought you were ready for marriage so you rushed in and got married and then you realized oh I'm not prepared for marriage or maybe you you had a big test big test at school or you had a big test at work and you like I don't need to study I got this you know you're just feeling all confident and then you take that test and afterwards you're like I maybe I should have studed for that test I don't I wasn't as prepared for that test as I thought I was and the question of this series is are you prepared for what God has prepared for you are you prepared for what God has prepared for you to be be prepared you can't focus on a position power prominence prestige a promotion or popularity you have to focus on Preparation everyone say preparation you've got to be prepared for what God has prepared for you when my mom realized I wasn't that good of a driver she made sure I got a driver's head got in driver's head took the class got my permit had to pass the class and I wasn't getting onto that Highway until I did driver's head got then I had to pass the test pass the written test and then I had to pass the driving test with the instructor I had to get prepared past the test before I could legally drive on the Highway by myself and just like I had to be prepared before my mom allowed me to drive on the highway you have to be prepared for the purpose God has for you you can't skip the preparation process there's no shortcut to getting prepared for what God has prepared for you so many people underestimate the preparation process they get tired of the process they get frustrated with the process so they turn their focus to promotion to trying to get power instead of focusing on preparing for God's purpose when God is ready to give you the keys to the car will you be ready to drive it will you be prepared for what God has prepared for you Benjamin Franklin said by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail Steph Curry who's made the most three-pointers in NBA history was asked how he accomplished this feat he responded with one word preparation every day he shoots 300 to 500 shots to prepare George Washington Carver said there is no shortcut to achievement life requires thorough preparation Alexander Gran Bell said before anything else the key to success is preparation Robert H Schuler said spectacular achievement is always preceded by unspectacular preparation David became the king at the proper time because he was prepared for it here's the key you have to prepare now for what God has next you have to prepare now for what God has next prepare now for the new business prepare now for the marriage you desire prepare now for the career position or promotion you're dreaming about prepare now for the new Godly friendships you need or the Financial Freedom you want prepare now for the ministry that God has for you or the new opportunities that God wants to bring your way see preparation is not just a part of life preparation is is life and as long as you and I are breathing we should always be preparing for what God has next for our life there's always a next with God and so let's study David's life some more and discover the power of the preparation process number one is this the preparation process develops your calling when God spoke to the prophet Samuel about David becoming the next king of Israel David had no clue he was simply be he was simply preparing by being faithful right where he was in 1st Samuel 16:11 it says while he was being faithful to take care of his father's sheep God spoke to him about his next season here's a big lesson we all have to learn about the preparation process don't be ConEd consumed on what God has next be consumed on what God has now don't be consumed on what God has next be consumed on what God has now God will show you what's next if you will be faithful with what's now God has always shown me what's next in my life while I was being faithful with what he had now for my life after I got saved I was attending IUPUI I was studying to be a high school teacher and I was just I was being faithful I was being faithful to go to my classes I was being faithful with my schoolwork I was being faithful in church I was at church every Sunday I was serving I was praying I was reading my Bible I was I was tithing matter of fact I was faithful uh to get baptized and water I was being faithful right where I was was at and it was when I got baptized that when God showed me what was next that he was calling me to full-time vocational Ministry and so when God showed me what was next I I transferred out of iupy and I went to Central Bible College and when I got to Central Bible College I was just Faith matter of fact I didn't want to be faithful I wanted to drop out of Bible College and go back home for Ministry I was doing but I but I stayed faithful I stayed faithful to my classes the work I was doing and then God started opening doors he opening doors for me to preach and open doors for missions trips and and and and different things and I went to Bible College I actually thought I was going to be a worship leader I was going to be up here but while I was just being faithful I was at that's where God revealed to me that he was calling me to youth ministry and so then I went and I became youth pastor in Columbus Ohio and while I was just being faithful and being a youth pastor in Columbus Ohio God began to stir our heart to transition something next was coming I remember saying to God but God these are my kids and God said no they're my kids and then he showed me what was next and we went to People's Church in Oklahoma city became their youth pastors and we were just faithful there for six and a half years and while we we were being faithful there God began to stir up our heart about lead pastoring and we weren't sure what that looked like but God made it very clear that our next step was to come back to Indianapolis and so we came back to indianap we did not come back to Indianapolis to start a People's Church we just came back to Indianapolis because we knew that's where're calling is when God called us and we came back to people we just were faithful where at matter of fact I I joined staff at another church real life at Pastor Adam deore and I was faithful to serve his vision and serve on his first impressions team and to serve him and it was while I was just being faithful serving him and I was still serving People's Church some that's when Pastor Herbert called and said hey what do you think about starting our first People's Church campus in Indianapolis listen we weren't looking to start a People's Church campus in Indianapolis we were just being faithful right where God had us and then God showed us what was next and we were able to start People's Church in Indianapolis over eight years ago listen the seasons of life will change and the key to discovering what's next is not to focus on what's next is to be faithful ful with what's now if you will be faithful with the now God will show you what he has next and you will be prepared for what's next here's my second point the preparation process develops your anointing what is anointing anointing is simply how God gives you his power to accomplish his purpose and a part of David's preparing for his purpose was he was anointed on three different occasions he was anointed in 1st Samuel 1613 2 Samuel 2:4 and 2 Samuel 57 the first time David was anointed happened in 1st Samuel 1613 let's read it together it says so Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers and from that day on the spirit of the Lord came power F upon David David was anointed and the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him and he was then anointed two more times and I want you to see what the Bible says after David was anointed the third time in 2 Samuel 5:10 it says and he became more and more powerful because the Lord God Almighty was with him David wasn't a great king because of his own power and strength he was a great king because he had God's power on his life listen we need the anointing and the power of God on our Life Church don't you try to accomplish God's purpose without God's power you will fail miserably you need the anointing of the Holy Spirit on your life like David let the anointing grow in your life let God keep filling you and anointing you with power so that you can be prepared prepared for his purpose you need to rely on God's power and one of the most important things you need to understand about the anointing of God is sometimes God will anoint you years before he appoints you sometimes God will anoint you years before he appoints you why does God do this point number number three the preparation process develops your character one big reason why God will anoint you but not appoint you is to develop your character after David was anointed to be king around 15 years went by before he became the king he was anointed and then he went right back to taking care of the sheep he then was called by King Saul to the king's Palace and he served King Saul then he took the bread and cheese to his brothers in the valley of Eli when they were all of the army of Israel was scared to death of Goliath then he fought Goliath and God used all of these experiences to develop David's character God is more concerned about your character being developed than your calling being delivered rewind let me say that again God is more concerned about your character being developed than your calling being delivered what God wants to do in you is more important than what God wants to do through you God is committed to preparing your your character to be strong enough to support the purpose he has for you and David he didn't rush the process he surrendered to it and God developed his character look at Psalm 7872 it says and David shephered them with Integrity of heart my prayer for all of us today is that our character will be developed to support the calling God has for us I I want God to say they shepherded their family with Integrity of heart they shephered their business their employees with Integrity of heart they shepherded their co-workers and Friends their classmates with Integrity of heart they shephered their dream team role their calling their god-given purpose with Integrity of heart god prepare us for what you have prepared for us number four the preparation prop the the preparation process develops your skills come on y'all remember Napoleon Dynamite I got skills God has given you gifts God's job is to give you your gifts you your job is to develop and Steward the gifts David was ready for what God had next because he developed his gifts and talents that God gave him Psalm 7872 it says and and David shephered them with the Integrity of heart and then it says with skillful hands he led them David skillfully LED God's people because he developed his skills by taking care of his father's sheep by learning how to skillfully play the harp by becoming a skillful Warrior he practiced and he became skillful he didn't rush the preparation process and just like David we have develop our gifts and talents that God has given us just because you're anointed doesn't mean you're ready to be appointed you need to discover the gifts that God has given you that's why we encourage you to go to growth track in growth track you will discover your gifts and your purpose and then in growth track we get you on the Dream Team and the dream team is where you develop your gifts and so if you have not gone through growth track get to growth track in the month of May discover your gifts your god-given gifts and talents and then get on the Dream Team here at People's Church so God can begin to develop your gifts I found that so many people never develop their gifts because they're too busy coveting someone else's gifts some of you need to stop focusing on what other people have stay in your lane and run your race come on tell your neighbor nudge them tell them stay in your lane stay in your lane develop the gifts God has given you focus on becoming the best version of you read books get your degree practice study grow develop practice study grow develop practice study grow develop become the best you that you can be purpose happens when your preparation and God's opportunity Collide will your gifts be developed when God is ready to bring this the next opportunity your way prepare now for what God has next everyone say prepare noware number five the preparation process develops your relationships during the preparation process God brings people into your life to help you prepare for your purpose the right people will help you their wisdom will protect you develop you and help Propel you into what God has next let's look back at David 1st Samuel chapter 19 verse 1 and two Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David but Jonathan had taken a great liking to David and warned him my father saw is looking for a chance to kill you be on your guard tomorrow morning go into hiding and stay there Saul wanted to kill and destroy and stop David's purpose but Jonathan was a friend that protected David he spoke the truth to David listen you need some people in your life that will take a great liking to you and will want to help you fulfill your god-given purpose some of you you have the wrong people in your life you have a soul in your life instead of a Jonathan the wrong people will tell you what you want to hear instead of what you need to hear but to fulfill your purpose you need some people that will speak the truth to you even when it's not easy to hear it wasn't easy for David to hear Jonathan tell him that his father that David served so Faithfully wanted to kill him John's like man I love you bro David I see some things that you don't see man all things aren't as good as you might think they are you got to make some changes you got to go in a different direction and those those were tough words for David to hear what do you mean I got to run I got to hide like I'm supposed to be the next king like what and a part of the preparation process is your willingness to be humble enough to surround yourself and listen to the right people that God brings into your life people that will tell you where you need to make some changes who will point out some bad habits that are hindering your life who will tell you areas where you need to grow so that you can fulfill your purpose listen God's preparation process always includes distancing yourself from the wrong people and listening to the right people the preparation process develops your relationship and then lastly number six the preparation process develops your confidence God's waiting room developed David's confidence everything David went through gave him the confidence for what God had next let me give you an example David was Faithfully taking care of his father's sheep when a lion and a bear came to attack the sheep and he killed them listen to what he says 1st Samuel 17: 3637 this is when the whole Army of Israel they're shaken in their boots they're terrified of Goliath and this is what David said he says your servant has killed both The Lion and the bear this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them because he has defied the armies of the Living God the Lord who rescued me from the Paw of The Lion and the Paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine Saul said to David go and the Lord be with you David had a confidence in the Lord and in the gifts that God has given him because of the preparation process matter of fact they tried to put some armor on him he's like no I've never practiced with that I'm not prepared for that but let me go get my slingshot and some smooth stones that I've been practicing with and I've gotten down pretty well listen the preparation process it will develop your confidence in God and in yourself not a false confidence but a confidence in the Lord that you're ready for what's next because you have been faithful with the now you're not focused on a position power prominence promotion or Prestige you are focused on getting prepared for what God has prepared for you because if you will be faithful with the now God will promote you to what he has next if you'll be faithful with the now right where you are faithful faithful faithful just faith not looking ahead but faithful in the now God will he'll promote you to what he has now next we got to embrace the preparation process there's something God wants to do in you before there's something he wants to do through you something he wants to develop and grow your trust and your character and your faith there's some relationships he wants to change and and some new ones he wants to get into your life there's a new confidence he wants to give you not confidence in yourself but confidence in the Lord and what God has called you to and wants to do in and through you you'll be faithful in the now God's preparing you and he will promote you to whatever he has next
xU3j7J5Biuk,"well today we are continuing our series called own it everybody say own it a friend of mine uh shared a story where they shared how several uh years ago they had moved to Iowa in the wintertime and the day that they moved into their house the temperature was Nega 10° the wind chill made it negative [Music] 28 I just don't sense the Lord's calling to Iowa for my life anytime soon um and so as they're moving in they got friends and family that are helping in the movers and they kept leaving open the front door and so my friend is constantly saying guys close the door close the door cuz they had the heat running and and he he shared how he left to run some errands and when he came back the door was wide open he ran into the house and the thermostat was set for 78 degrees but the temperature in the house was 55 degrees come on have y'all got some family some children they got the spiritual gift of leaving the front door open you know what I'm saying like close the front door close the door and this is a great picture of what life looks like for a lot of people they have the heat on but they're still cold because the front door is wide open they blame everybody else on why their life is cold and we have to stop blaming and we need to go go shut the door we got to close the door and that's what we've been talking about in this series we've been talking about stop blaming people stop making excuses and we have to start doing our theme verse Philippians 2:12 it says work out your salvation with fear and trembling if you look at verse 14 after that it says do everything without complaining and arguing don't spend your life making excuses and blam bling people and circumstances for where you are in life don't spend your life blaming people for something you did to yourself come on you knew that man didn't have a job when you married him I mean he was looking good but you knew he didn't want to work you knew she was as mean as an upset Pitbull when you started dating her so why are you complaining about her bad attitude you knew you know he didn't go to church when you started dating him so don't get bent out all out of shape when he says no when you ask him to go to church with you come on you knew your friends were getting drunk and high when you first started hanging out with them don't blame them for your party and lifestyle come on you knew when you had kids they were gonna cry have poopy diapers go to school and have homework quit acting surprise blaming people in the Devil with the responsibilities that come with being a parent I've seen people even blame God for where they are in life Proverbs 19:3 people ruin their lives by their own foolishness and then they are angry at the Lord this happens all the time people make stupid decisions and then suffer the consequences of those decisions and blame God God you need to give me more energy I'm always tired help me Lord God says stop blaming me and stop staying up half the night on Netflix playing video games and scrolling on social media God you still haven't fixed my marriage God says stop blaming me and go apologize go on a date go to counseling well we tried counseling and it didn't work you went to counseling four times y'all been acting a fool and fighting for over a decade and you thought four meetings of counseling was going to fix that God says you have to stick with it and stop blaming me God why' you give me these crazy kids God says first of all you are the one that did you know what to get those kids I didn't make you do that and stop blaming me start spending time with your kids start teaching them the word of God start providing loving discipline L start bringing them to the People's Church kids ministry and epic student Ministries on Wednesday night God stop making me gain all this weight God says stop blaming me put down the honey bun and get some skinny popcorn all right God I've been attending People's Church for three years and you still haven't given me any good Christ Christian friends God says stop blaming me and getting a small group go to Brotherhood go to Sisterhood well I went once and it wasn't for me you went one time and you wanted me to do a miracle in your friendships don't blame me for your lack of effort Lord I've been at this job three years and you haven't given me a raise or a promotion God says stop calling in sick all the time stop missing your work deadline stop gossiping about all your co-workers stop showing up late and leaving early stop taking a twoh hour lunch when you're supposed to only take [Music] one Lord you aren't blessing my finances give me some more money some Financial pieace I even took the the three-month tide Challenge and I gave to the miracle offering and you haven't blessed my finances I'm still in a financial mess and God says stop blaming me you're the one that racked up all that credit card debt on 25% interest that's actually what he said to me and Jamie we literally did that we racked up thousands of credit card debt on 25% interest but guys like stop BL you're the one that keeps getting a new outfit every paycheck you're the one buying a coffee drink every day from the coffee shop you're the one going out to eat three times a week instead of cooking at home you're the one that bought that new car with that big old car payment and now you're blaming me because you don't have Financial Peace you have to stop blaming God for where you are in life you have to stop being frustrated and mad at God you got to own it a and some of you you're frustrated with God to the point that you're beginning to doubt the promises in the Bible you look at scriptures like Philippians 4:19 it says and my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus and you wonder if this scripture is really true because your needs are not being met you look at Matthew 6:33 it says but seek first his kingdom in righteousness and these things will be given to you as well and you're not so sure that verse is true because God hasn't provided all these things in your life Malachi 3:10 it says bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my temple if you do says the Lord of the heaven armies I will open up the windows of of Heaven for you and I will pour out a blessing so great you won't have enough room to take it in try it put me to the test and some of you don't believe this verse because you don't see any Windows of blessing open in your life you don't have more than enough and so you doubt the promises of God but but listen what you have to understand about God's promises is many of them are conditional you have to do your part and then God will do his part for example Philippians 4:19 it's one of the most misquoted scriptures the context of This Promise is talking about how God would Supply the Church of Philippi needs because because they gave generously to the kingdom of God it was conditional and the promise is true for you and I today if you do your part God will do his part your part of Matthew 6:33 is to seek first God's kingdom and then God will provide all these other things but if you don't do your part God is not obligated to do his part your part in Malachi 3:1 is to tithe to your local church and then God will open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings on your life if you do your part God will do his part but listen even when God opens the windows of Heavens your part is not over you still have to Steward the blessings that God pours out see so many Christians they got the front door wide open because they don't Steward well the blessings that God pours out so Their Blessings are going right out the door Jamie and I we had the front door wide open in our mid to late 20s we were tithers we were givers but it sure didn't feel like God was blessing us because we weren't doing our part we made some some poor financial decisions we got ourselves into debt up to our eyeballs we had car debt credit card debt student loan debt we put furniture on the credit card vacations all on the credit God had the windows open he was pouring blessings upon Jamie and I cuz we were tithing and giving but our front door was wide open and we were having major financial problems I mean we love God we prayed we went to church we served at church I was a pastor we tied and gave offerings but we were upside down financially living paycheck to paycheck having no money in our savings God opened the windows of heaven and he was pouring out blessings but we had the front door wide open and some of you can relate to where we were in our mid to late 20s it doesn't feel like God God is blessing your life because you have the front door wide open and so you have Financial stress and pressure and some of you are even blaming God and I want to encourage you to do what Jamie and I did we finally came to our senses praise the Lord in our early 30s we decided we have to own our finances and I want to encourage you to start to own your to own it if you don't own them they will own own you and so for the next few moments I want to talk to you from a story out of the Old Testament there was a woman who loved God but she experienced a major financial crisis look at excuse me look at Second Kings 4:1 it says the wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha your servant my husband is dead you you know that he revered the Lord but now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves she was a grieving Widow raising two boys all by herself her husband had provided for the family he was a man of God he revered God but he made some poor financial decisions and he got his he got his family into financial trouble and now creditors are coming to take her two sons to make them work off the debt this single mom was grieving she can't pay her bills she can't pay the debt she's about to lose her two babies to creditors she was in a desperate situation and today I want us to learn from her story and I want to give you three mind mindset shifts to have you have to make to own your finances three mindset shifts you have to make to own your finances because if you will change your thinking you'll change your life if you'll change your thinking you'll change your life to close the front door got to change your thinking and so here's the first mind mindset uh shift number number one own the overwhelmed mindset own the overwhelmed mindset this lady was overwhelmed overwhelmed with bills about to lose her two boys and God sent a a prophet Elisha to give her Direction and in verses 2 through 4 he helps her overcome her overwhelmed mindset and I believe God sent me today to be your Prophet to help you overcome your overwhelmed mindset listen living overwhelmed it will stop stop you from owning your finances some of you you are overwhelmed with bills and debt and stress and fear and hopelessness maybe you're overwhelmed because you grew up in a home that never taught you how to handle money or or or or all you ever saw modeled for you was bad examples so you don't even know what Financial Peace looks like today I want you to understand that your greatest financial problem is not your bills your debt your lack of savings it's your overwhelmed mindset you are digging a deeper and deeper hole because of your mindset and if you'll change your thinking you'll change your life you have to calm down take a deep breath because there's hope there's hope you can get a plan together to get some Financial Peace but the plan won't matter if you don't overcome the overwhelmed mindset you got to take a deep breath and calm down listen you can do this change your thinking and you'll change your life change your thinking you'll change your life number two you have to own the poverty mindset 2 Kings 4:2 Elisha replied to her how can I help you tell me what you do have in your house your servant has nothing there at all she said except a small jar of olive oil the Widow didn't see any way out of her dire financial situation she said I got nothing I got a little Jo I got a little jar of oil that's it I I I I can't do anything about my situation I'm broke I'm stuck it is what it is the poverty mindset causes you to overlook what you do have because you're so focused on what you don't have see some of you have a poverty mindset you're so focused on what you don't have that you're overlooking what you do have and today I'm your prophet and I'm here to tell you stop focusing on what you don't have because you're going to get out of your financial Hole by what you do have today I want you to break free from the poverty mindset that has you believe in that you can't do any better has you believing that you have to keep spending more than you make that you have to be upside down financially it is what it is that you can't pay off your credit card debt you can't ever be financially free the poverty mindset it is sabotaging your success it has you waiting on some somebody to bail you out of your financial hope but listen what you need is in your house it's in your house the Widow lady had a little oil in her house listen what you have in your house it may not seem like much but I'm telling you that it's enough to get started if you have a little energy it's enough to get started if you have a little money a little job a little food a little faith a little hope it's enough to get started but you have you have to start with what you have in your house stop letting the poverty mindset keep you from seeing what you already have you have enough to get started on the road of Financial Freedom and peace so start with what you have change your thinking and you'll change your life and then number three own the this is too much work mindset on the this is too much work mindset 2 Kings chapter 4 verses 3-7 Elisha said go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars don't ask for just a few then go inside shut the door behind you and your sons pour oil into all the jars and as each is filled put it to one side she left them and shut the door behind her and her sons they brought the jars to her and she kept pouring when all the jars were full she said to her son bring me another one but he replied there is not a jar left then the oil stopped flowing she went and told the man of God and he said go s sell the oil and pay your debts you and your sons can live on what is left this Widow lady had what she needed to get started but it required hard work to get Financial Freedom and peace she had a little oil in the jar and she got started with what she had she used her legs to walk to her neighbor's house work she used her mouth to ask them for jars work she used her arms and her legs to carry the jars back to her home work she used her hands to pour the oil into the jars work she had to get a plan to Market and to sell the oil work she had to to track down the bill collectors and pay off her debt work she had to manage what she had left over so that she could take care of her two boys work see we love to focus on the Supernatural part of this story you know what I mean we love to talk about how God multiplied the oil oh but let me tell you something a huge part of this success story was the fact that this lady put in work to see her financial situation turn around if you want to see your situation turn around it will require work you didn't get in a financial hole overnight and you won't get out of it overnight but you can get out if you will make up your mind to put in the work listen here's the raw rugged reality it's hard work being broke it's hard work being broke it's hard work living paycheck to paycheck it's hard work staying stressed out over your money it's hard work watching your debt continue to climb it's hard work robbing Peter to pay Paul is hard work every time something breaks down you don't know how you're going to pay for it is hard work arguing with your spouse over money listen that's the wrong hard work I want to teach you the right hard work I want you to choose the right hard work I want you to work the biblical plan let let me give you a a a biblical plan the right hard work number one track your income and your spending yeah hard work you going to have to get out a pencil some paper calculator you know what I'm saying you might need a couple of erasers bust out the Excel sheet you may need to call a friend take some hard worko I remember early 30s it it's not just hard work it's painful work I remember when I first did it I was like oh Lord I I've shared with this with y'all before I remember sitting down with Jamie at Chili's on our date night I'm like hey baby it's our last supper she like what do you mean this last time we come to Chili's for a date she's like we did the two for 20 yall remember the two for 20 chilies get you the the chips and the salsa two Entre and a dessert for $20 I said yeah we're not going to be able to do that anymore I started showing her the numbers and the finances took some hard work y'all we became Mall Walkers praise the Lord they don't charge you for walking in the mall although that's kind of torturous because you can't stop at the food court or buy anything at the mall so but you got and you got to you got to you got to do it it's hard it's the right work it's the right work and then you got to work it you got to stick to it you got to have a budget and you got to work it you got to but it's the right work number two you got to save $1,000 in an emergency fund may take some hard work to get there you going have to cut out some some unnecessary spending Jamie and I we had to cut some yeah we had to cut the cable we had to cut some stuff down we maybe didn't get what the best cell phone company in the world that we wanted but we had to cut that down we we need to get all the bars that we wanted we had we had to cut some stuff we had to cut we had to cut some unne you got to work it's the right hard work to get yourself a ,000 in a in an emergency fund so then number three come on you can pay off your Consumer Debt from smallest to largest was hard work remember we started just chipping away and it was hard work it was but it was the right work took us three years three years to pay off all of our debt in those three years it took there was hard work it one but it was the right work it was the right work it was the right it was hard work to get that tax return check and put it towards debt money we already spent when we we wanted to go on that vacation I wanted to buy them new shoes Jamie wanted that outfit we want to go to roof Chris it was hard work that when God blessed us financially they say no no no we're going to stay diligent we got a plan and we're going to work it and we're going to pay off this debt because we want to be financially free it's the right work it was hard work and I'm telling you can do it and we thought it' take longer than three years to be honest with you but with God's blessing it took three years years it's hard work but you can do it it's the right work it's the right work and then after you pay off all your debt listen save 3 to six months in an emergency fund you just never know when life going to hit you don't know what's going to happen it's hard work but work but I'm telling you it's the right work it's the right work number five start tithing now get God involved now I've heard people say Pastor I can't afford to tithe listen I can't afford not to tithe I'm not stealing from God I'm no no no no no no no soon as I get paid that 10 10% is going directly to the Lord and I'm I'm going work it I'm going to figure out the 90% get involved today start now it's hard work but you can do it you can do it set it up set up reoccuring giving get God's blessing on your finances so we can start pouring it out right as long as you choose to do that the the the the window's closed doesn't even matter if your front door is open or not the window from Heaven's closed if he says you start TI he's going to open up that window he'll prevent the pest from destroying your crops get God involved and then number six live with margin it's hard work live within your means live within margin get a plan get a goal stick to it do 10 1080 tith that's first 10% goes to God then it starts saving 10% and live off 80 some of you you could start doing that right now some of you like there ain't no way I can do 10 108 that's okay do 10 288 tithe start saving 2% living off 88 but then start working to start living off 85 82 80 so you can tithe 10 you can save 10 and then you can live off 80% and then grow grow in your generosity the tithe is the minimum it it goes to the Lord it belongs to him but God wants us to be generous so start to do 15 1075 10% goes to God you start giving over and above your tithe 5% so 15% is going to his kingdom 10% going into savings and start living off 75% Jamie and I we started setting these goals for oursel and realizing man we can't achieve them we can't achieve it's hard work it's hard work but it's the right work get to 2010 2010 70 where you're you're you're tithing 10% but you're giving away 10% because you can't outgive God okay I'm telling you as you give God's going to keep blessing and then keep saving that 10% and living off the 70% listen it may seem so far off and I'm telling you to Jamie and I it seems so far off it was hard work hard work some of the hardest work we had to do we we we ended up selling back a car that we had bought that had a $500 a month payment and we got on a car with $179 payment and then when we paid that off guess what we drove that bad boy till the wheels fall off we don't need another car payment we don't need we're going to start saving and saving and saving and it's hard work and we had to make tough choices and it was difficult but it was the right work it was the right hard work cuz I'm telling you all that day we wrote that last payment on our credit C card when the credit card debt hit zero and we had no more oh y'all we I Don't Dance much I can't Bust A Move worth a lick but in my house y'all I won't do anymore cuz I'm going to embarrass myself but I'm telling you there's nothing that can compare Financial Freedom is it going to be hard I'm not going to lie it's going to be hard but it's worth it and I've talked to people I have a friend took him 10 years to get financially free but he said oh it was worth it it was worth it it's the right hard work it's the right hard work and I'm telling you God if you'll put them first if you'll trust them you change your thinking it'll change your life I know some of you even right now the overwhelmed mindset is hitting you right now you starting to sweat you're getting anxi I'm just just just bring it in I'm telling you God I'll help you God I'll help you you can get a plan you can put it together come you got to get rid of that poverty mindset some of you you have just settled for it is what it is I'm always going to be a slave to the lender no no no no no no no no God I want you to be free want you to have Financial Freedom you got to own it's going to be hard work but it's the right great hard work Own It own it because if you don't own your finances they will own you God didn't create you for the dollar to own you he created you to manage it and to own it and to Steward it well and to Steward it with freedom and peace"
Y1FcYKtO_2o,well last week we started a new series called bounce back good advice for a bad day man if you were here last week aren't you thankful for that message pastor preached about on your worst day ever choose to forgive i know i know it blessed me tremendously and i think all of us would agree though that we all have bad days don't we i'm a talk back preacher so you can talk back to me that's okay just to give you a heads up if you're new or it's your first time i grew up pentecostal so if the crowd is right here i'm usually right about here so if you can imagine what i look like watching iu basketball that's basically me all right but so if somebody from the back yells preach it white boy don't get scared like it's just it's a thing they do it's normal disregard it's fine you're safe but yo we you you'd have to agree we all encounter bad days some of y'all woke up today like some of y'all thought you were coming to the to the 9 30 service or a different service you forgot to change your clock now you're here you're late but hey better late than never man so some of you all be like pastor and you talk about having a bad day i've been there or that's where i'm at today and you know even as followers of jesus we can read our bible every day we can pray every day we be in god's house every sunday or every wednesday if you're a student we can give generously above our tithe consistently we can serve on a dream team we can even be leading or attending a small group but at the end of the day none of those things disqualify us or exempt us from ever having a bad day we know that from experience right in fact the bible even tells us in the book of james james chapter one the writer says count it all joy not if but when you face trouble hardship and trials not if but when jesus even said in the book of john he said in this world you will have trouble like it's a part of life bad days are going to happen because the reality is that we live in a fallen world that has been left broken and fractured by the impact of sin you see when sin entered into our world it brought about pain it brought about suffering loss hardship and even death you see john chapter 16 jesus did say in this world you will have trouble but i'm thankful the verse doesn't stop there because jesus would go on to say in this world you will have trouble but take heart he says don't you dare lose heart don't you throw away your confidence don't worry don't get discouraged don't be afraid don't lose hope because i have overcome the world and you know what yes we're all gonna experience bad days in life but the good news i'm here to share with you today is that your bad day does not have to get the best of you a bad day does not have to define your life or have the final say in your story but because of jesus we can overcome any setback and we can always bounce back from having a bad day and the key to bouncing back from a bad day is it all in how you choose to respond to your circumstances and that's why during this series we're intentionally examining the seven powerful final statements that jesus made on the cross during the worst day that any human could have possibly ever experienced and i don't know about you today but i'm thankful that jesus chose the cross and he understood that enduring his worst day would bring about the most meaningful moment in all of human history so my title for today's message is bad day best witness bad day best witness i i've been preaching the gospel man i remember the first time i ever preached i was nine years old some of y'all are like that's not a normal nine-year-old no it is not from the time i remember from the time i was 10 to 14 every year i found myself every now and again going to speak at churches and youth groups in indiana in michigan in ohio like yo i was a travel evangelist and not even a teenager yet like what in the world and i remember i remember during one of these uh ministry trips early on uh i just finished like preaching and in a middle school full of teenagers families and man it went super well and i was down on the altar just praying over like babies and teenagers and adults and i remember when i was doing all that a lady came up to my mom and was like man i bet your son is just perfect like the closest thing we like he's like john the baptist like he just came out of the your belly like filled with the holy ghost didn't he like he probably never sins never gets into trouble at home or at school like he just he is so perfect and my mom just gave her the look like honey you don't live with this boy he did not come out of you you did not raise him let me assure you he is just a boy he is human he gets into trouble still he makes mistakes he's imperfect if his siblings aren't getting on his nerves he's getting on their nerves come on i actually remember there was one time after one of these preaching trips it was in the seventh grade so i was about 12 or 13 years old we just got back from one of these ministry trips preaching at a revival event it was awesome like people got saved people were healed it was great but i remember coming back that weekend um i just i would ju it was like the first month of starting a new school in seventh grade so like i'm still meeting new friends getting to know people they're getting to know me well a lot of my classmates and peers found out like man over the weekend he went up to michigan to preach like this dude's a teenager he's us and he's preaching like they're like hey cox like is your message is on youtube i'm like yeah they put them on youtube so they were actually watching my stuff on youtube like okay andrew like this guy ain't bad for a little kid you know he's one of us all right this is cool so i started developing like a reputation amongst my peers it was a good reputation which was awesome however i do remember that week coming off that awesome weekend where i was just on fire on cloud nine on top of the world that very same weekend it was like i think it was a tuesday i don't i don't remember exactly i was in uh gym class with all my classmates we're stretching warming up and i don't know what put it upon her to do this but there was a freshman girl who i don't know if she was having a bad day i don't know if she didn't like me i don't know if she liked me and that's why she was doing it but she just decided to start hurling insults at me and i was just kind of like girl who even are you like what are you doing right now and so you would have thought man me being the young passionate jesus loving preacher boy that i was i would have just ignored her and turned the other cheek and unfortunately that is not what i do i said honey if you want to play this game two will play at it and i will not lose so i started throwing insults back i was it was just kind of like you know my mama can cook better than your mama or my mama can run faster than your mom or is like shut up no you shut up you know like i was a better preacher than i was at like coming up with comebacks obviously and so we get into this argument finally the gym teacher's just like i've had enough of this she goes both y'all gonna run laps before class starts you're gonna get that anger out and you'll stop running when i tell you to stop running so y'all i got home from school that day my parents growing up they're here today by the way so they're making sure i tell this story right if they even remember it but i remember getting home that day my my parents were the kind of parents that was like how was school you didn't get by with just like one word answers like good what'd you learn about jesus like that didn't fly so they were like they wanted details so i remember telling them about other stuff i started with the end of my day i told them about gym what happened i was like homegirl thought she get a fight she got a fight with the wrong dog like da da so i'm telling the whole story and when i'm done i'm like they're gonna they're gonna team with their baby like they're gonna be on my side and i'll never forget after i get done telling them what happened i'm waiting for the response my dad looks at me and he says son you need to realize something and i'm like oh this ain't gonna be good my dad says son you have a reputation there are people who are watching you they are watching the example that you set and i'm like where in the world is he even going with this right now and i remember he was saying son you just got back from preaching this weekend and he said after you preached the house down you missed an opportunity today from god to be a good example in a bad situation i was like is this my dad talking or is this the holy spirit speaking through my dad i was like that cut deep i was like i was like all right all right and he was saying son you really need to be more intentional more careful about the example you set away from the pulpit i thought man if you're gonna preach it you need to practice it when you're not when the mic is not in your hand and my my dad began to teach me he was saying you're preaching outside the pulpit the way you live your life is gonna be the best sermon that you ever preach like it's not about your gift your gift will take you it will get you into places but your character will keep you there and you know i learned a very valuable important lesson that day i learned that just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you have to let it turn into a bad witness in fact your bad day might just be a perfect opportunity to be your best witness and so today i want to draw your attention to luke chapter 23 at this point in the story of jesus he's already been beaten he's been flogged he's crucified his hands and feet have been pierced by the hammering of the nails the metal spikes and he's experienced this extreme amount of blood loss and as jesus is hanging on the cross his worst day ever he finds himself hanging between two criminals who are also experiencing their worst day ever and so i want you to notice in luke 23 picking up at verse 39 how each of these three men responded in the middle of their bad day let's look at it together luke 23 39 one of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at jesus aren't you the messiah save yourself and us yo that's one way to respond when you're having a bad day isn't it throw insults why because you're hurt you're angry the pain is real you're frustrated and so what do you do you lash out you let what you're feeling and experiencing get the best of you in the moment but look what happens in verse verse 40. it says but the other criminal rebuked him don't you fear god he said since you are under the same sentence we are punished justly for we are getting what our deeds deserve but this man has done nothing wrong and then verse 42 then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom somebody say remember me verse 43 jesus answered him truly today mr truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise i want to show you three things we can learn from this moment with jesus that if we'll actually do them they will help us learn how we can get through a bad day the first thing we learn from jesus is this number one remember why you're still here remember why you're still here so the second criminal on the cross said jesus remember me you know i can't even begin to imagine what kind of thoughts and emotions were racing through the criminal's mind before he finally mustered up enough courage to present his request to jesus i mean the audacity that it would take to do such a thing was that even the right moment to be bothering jesus after all that the perfect sinless spotless son of god has been through is now really the time to be selfish and think about yourself and i think jesus very well could have said oh homeboy i will remember you all right like i know what you did you've been disobedient you're on this cross for a reason you've fallen short you have missed the mark by a mile your whole entire life you've rejected the love and grace of god time and time again i've been out here teaching preaching healing people casting out demons feeding the hungry helping the poor showing compassion i've been doing all these things that you didn't have time for it because you didn't make time for it why because you were too busy out here running wild and just doing your own thing living life your own way you had plenty of chances to get it right and now here you are on your deathbed about to experience your last heartbeat take your last breath and now you want to hit me up and talk oh i remember you but jesus didn't say any of that did he jesus didn't rebuke him jesus did not condemn him jesus didn't say hey told you so that's not what jesus did you see jesus knew this criminal was about to die and so even though jesus found himself in his lowest darkest most his weakest moment it was actually his best moment to change this man's life how many all know when we're tired when we're hurting when it feels like we're at rock bottom it's easy to turn inward it's easy to feel sorry for ourselves what we're going through and to allow our feelings and discouragement to get the best of and too many of us it's easy to allow our circumstances to cause us to lose perspective and to forget about what matters most but you see jesus his whole entire mission the reason he left evan and heaven and came to earth to begin with was to save and rescue people who were lost hurting and broken and hopeless look at what jesus said about himself in luke chapter 19 verse 10 he said for the son of man came why to seek and to save the lost and so even on his work day worst day ever jesus never lost sight of why he came jesus his pain his pain was real all the betrayal the suffering he experienced it wasn't insignificant because of his mission but even when it would have been the easiest for jesus to forget about his mission he remembered why he was hanging on the cross in the first place and even in our most painful and heartbreaking moments church family we cannot fail to remember that even on our worst days the world is still watching us your spouse who doesn't know jesus is watching you your kids they're watching you students your teachers your classmates they're watching you your coaches and your teammates they're watching you your boss and your fellow employees they are all watching you just as the criminal cried out and said jesus remember me i believe that we live in a broken world who right now today all around us they are not only watching us but they are also calling out to us saying remember me last week it would have been a few days ago uh i i was at the gym you all know i got a wedding coming up so i'm trying to look good you know what i'm saying like gotta keep up with her that's impossible but anyways i'm at the gym and i'm working out and y'all i don't know what it is with people but like normally when january is over the gym is empty again and i praise god for that because i'm like i like being at church with a lot of people i don't like being at the gym with a lot of people so i'm sorry if i go to the same gym as you but but i remember like that day it was just crowded everybody had their earbuds in doing their own thing i'm trying to finish my workout get out get on with the rest of my day and for whatever reason i didn't bring my earbuds with me that day i'm like that's fine sometimes music is distracting i need to focus and so i'm finishing up on this machine all right and i'm like ready to move on to the next one and immediately it's like when i took my first step away from the machine i began to hear help help and i just kind of stopped and i was like yes lord your servant is listening like what is where is this coming from i'm like did i am i just hearing things so i like i kept walking like okay whatever but i kept hearing it again help help like somebody was struggling to breathe like they're fighting for breath and i'm like what in the world i'm like looking around like what is going on i'm not crazy i keep hearing it over and over again and finally i turn around on the other side of the gym there was a young man probably my age who was benching 225 and i don't know how many reps this brother got in he did not have a spotter and so when the bar came back down he could not push it off of himself anymore and so he tried to slide out from underneath it and when he did the bar literally got caught on his neck and so all the way from the other side of the gym i see 225 pounds sitting completely on top of this brother's neck and i'm looking around there's people all around him earbuds in doing their thing have no clue what is going on right in front of them and i thought oh my gosh i threw my water bottle down i ran as fast as i could i got like that spirit of samson that came on me i grabbed the 225 just threw it up like it was nothing i'm like i knew that was god because that just doesn't happen and i'm like checking on my brother are you okay like he wasn't severely hurt or anything and then everybody started figuring out what was going on and they were like oh my goodness like that was happening the whole time in front of us and you know it kind of just it really made me think you know i had my workout to do i had my schedule i was trying to get through but like in that moment there was nothing more important to me than making sure this guy did not lose his life or get severely injured i'm like and there was just this urgency i was like man if i don't do this now i'm gonna regret it later i'm the only one who has eyes and is aware of this guy's need you know i didn't take out my phone and put a reminder like hey before you leave the gym today make sure you go check and that the bar is still not on his neck and if it is you can help him then like that's ridiculous like hold on bro i got one more set let me knock out these 15 real quick like no there was an urgency this was a matter of life and death and you see church family we can't allow a bad day to cause us to forget why we are actually still alive on this earth it's not to make money it's not to get the house it's not to get the car it's not about our materialistic lives i know that heaven is our home and we're just passing through but don't forget why you are still here because if you are not dead if you are still breathing and jesus christ has not come back yet then that means there is still time on the clock god is not finished with you yet come on somebody you need to remember why you are still here because no matter what you go through there is nothing more important than rescuing one more person out of the flames of hell and leading them to heaven through jesus christ because jesus is the only way you see we need to remember why we're still here but number two second thing we learned from jesus is this we need to think long term we need to think long term you see at the end of the day jesus didn't allow a temporary moment to cause him to lose sight of the bigger picture i would even go as far to suggest that it was probably what even gave jesus the strength to persevere through the suffering and to endure through the cross remember that when the criminal asked jesus to remember him remember jesus responded this way in verse 30 verse 43 jesus answered him truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise jesus understood in that moment even with all the pain and suffering they were both experiencing that none of it would last forever he knew that better days were ahead and that's so pivotal for us to learn if we want to bounce back from a bad day it's the ability to see beyond the moment and to think about the long term what is to come because jesus recognized that without being saved by the grace of god this criminal would experience something far worse than a bad day he would experience a bad eternity because where this man spent eternity mattered most to jesus watch this he chose to move beyond his pain in the moment and change this man's life forever and i think a lot of us we struggle at times to get over a bad day because we feel like it's just never going to end it's never going to go away we can't see beyond the pain that we feel in the present moment but i want to encourage you today to think long term because even if what you're going through what you came into the house of god carrying with you today even if it existed from the time you were born and you take it with you to the grave i want you to know that all suffering still has an expiration date look at what the bible says in psalm chapter 30 verse 5. it says weeping may stay for the night but rejoicing comes in the morning church family we cannot lose sight of eternity or the fact that there's more at stake than just what's taking place here and now because life on earth is only temporary the bible says in james chapter 4 what is your life it says it's this myth that appears for a moment and then quickly vanishes away hebrews chapter 9 verse 27 it tells you that it is appointed unto man once to die and then to face judgment look at hebrews 9 27 in the message translation it says everyone has to die once then face the consequences christ's death was also a one-time event but it was a sacrifice that took care of sins forever church family life is short life is temporary and eternity is forever and in light of that we need to remember a couple things we need to remember there's a heaven to be gained if if what we have right now on this earth is guaranteed to not last forever that should be good news to you because that means whatever you're going through whatever your suffering looks like it's not going to last for forever all the heartache all the pain the bible says when we get to heaven we're free from all of it we're free from all this mess no more pain no more suffering come on no more sickness no more pandemic no more covid 19 no more depression and anxiety no more death you see no more tears of sorrow but only tears of joy is there anybody thankful today that we have a place in heaven that jesus has prepared for us where we're free from all this mess and all this suffering you see not only do we need to understand there's a heaven to be gained but we also need to realize there's still a hell to be avoided hell is real the bible describes it as worse than anything we could possibly ever imagine why because it is the literal it is the literal tangible presence of everything that is evil and wicked and it is the absence of everything that is good godly and holy let me remind you about the heart of god and his will he says it's not his will that any should perish god's plan is not that any person no matter who they are what they've done it is not his desire not his will that they spend eternity in hell being tormented suffering and eternally separated from god but you see those who reject the love the grace and forgiveness of god when they do so they make a decision to pay for their own sin forever and ever and ever but you see hell will be beyond any bad day we could ever experience on this earth and i don't want to minimize the pain you're facing today i know that many of you you're carrying so much so many heavy burdens right now but i want to encourage you from god's word today that your pain what you're carrying won't last forever and perhaps the best way you can overcome your pain today is to know that god can use your witness in your example to impact someone else's eternity you just need to think long term the third and final thing we learned today from the example of jesus is this number three make the most of every opportunity ephesians chapter 5 verses 15 and 16 so be careful how you live don't live like fools but like those who are wise make the most of every opportunity in these evil days y'all jesus never missed a moment despite the way he felt all he had been through he didn't focus on himself he owned the moment he saw the situation as an opportunity to impact this man's eternity and what did he do he made the most of it church family our time on this earth that is so short and so limited reality we wake up to every day whether we realize it or not whether we like it or not eternity is hanging in the balance when you have a moment to share the love and hope of jesus christ with somebody around you in your circle don't allow the difficulty of a bad day to disqualify you and keep you from fulfilling an opportunity for the kingdom students can i preach to you for a minute don't miss an opportunity when you're at school don't don't give in to all the middle school high school drama don't take your cues from culture would you learn to stand in your faith and live for jesus no matter what would you share your faith tell your story bring them to epic so that they can encounter jesus like you are this is for everybody in the room when you're at your job and your boss is getting on your nerves or that co-worker is getting on your i'm preaching to somebody come on when they're getting on your nerves and don't lash out don't gossip don't back talk remember you're not working for a man or a woman you are there on an assignment a kingdom assignment from god the workplace is your mission field and god has put you there on purpose for such a time as this would you make the most of every opportunity you have in your community or when you're out and about at the ball game or the restaurant man don't don't ruin your testimony off a bad call made at an eight and under basketball game like it's not worth it your kid's not going pro i'm sorry i'm just kidding i don't know don't miss an opportunity to speak life and encouragement to somebody else y'all if they get your order wrong at the restaurant give grace the way you want to receive it hey i know we don't know it like man the other day i ordered a water i got charged for a coke i was like hey i had a water they're like oh it's it basically works out the same cost i'm like water's free i'm like but i had to remember man i'm called to be an example i understand hey mistakes happen it's all good man i understand you're short staffed but man i appreciate you being here and working hard hey do you work on sunday you should come to people's church have you heard of people's church but y'all if you're gonna do that you better leave a good tip that's all i'm saying that is all i'm saying you see no matter where you are what kind of day you're having make the most of every opportunity you can bounce back you can make the most of the moment you see when the devil tries to throw you off the mission with a bad day let the world around you see how you to adversity how you handle life's difficulties because when you have god on your side and god in your corner i want you to know today peace in the storm is possible and that your pain can serve a purpose and it will serve a purpose if you give it to god and let him use it i know the doctor's report is real but you can bounce back you may be totally your car you lost your job you didn't get the promotion you wanted the promotion you thought you deserved but you can bounce back maybe the divorce got finalized you can still bounce back you can bounce back why because you are on a mission the world is watching your bad day may be your best opportunity to be a good witness and don't you dare let the devil get in your way i'll close with this story about a young lady named marissa early on in her life she felt called to be a missionary overseas and sadly at an early age her mother was diagnosed with cancer that was fatal and she ended up losing her life and sometime after her mother lost the battle to cancer her brother ended up running away from home and leaving the family so here's this young lady loves jesus on fire for god wants to make a difference feels like man the world is just crumbling all around her but she made a commitment and a decision as a teenager man i'm not gonna abandon god's plan for my life like god has a purpose i'm not gonna forget about it just because of what i'm going through and this past summer at our oklahoma city campus we invited marissa to come speak uh during one of the nights of the teen camp for the middle school and high school students so she thankfully she agreed to do it she's an awesome young lady and the day before she was scheduled to speak she was driving down one of the busiest highways in houston texas and while she was driving suddenly out of nowhere her car literally caught on fire while she was driving and so what the car i believe we have pictures of it literally while the car is still moving she had to jump out of the moving vehicle while the car caught on fire because her brakes had gone out and so she ends up calling one of our pastors on staff at oklahoma city lets them know what happens and the pastor says hey marissa man i'm so sorry to hear that i totally understand if you're not able to come and speak tomorrow night we'll get it covered and we'll get it taken care of but y'all marissa just would not be denied she said pastor joseph you better believe i'm still gonna go there don't you think i'm gonna let the devil get in my way and get me to forget about the mission god gave me for this week so y'all sure enough that night marissa showed up she preached the house down the presence of god invaded that auditorium there were middle school high school students who said yes to jesus lives were changed all because there was a young lady who stood up in the face of adversity and said young people look at this this is how you respond to adversity this is how you make a difference for jesus even in the middle of your pain in the middle of your struggle this is how you bounce back from having a bad day see church family you too can bounce back your bad day your worst day can be your best witness don't lose hope don't lose faith don't give up because if you're going through a bad day no matter what circumstances have caused you to get to where you are today whether it's because of your own actions or the actions of another you can call on jesus to help you because he loves you and he's for you
CerNanlXkiw,well today we're continuing our series on Miracles nothing is too hard for God have you ever wondered what's stopping you from receiving your miracle I believe today's message is going to give you some more insight on how to receive a miracle for God when I go into a public restroom and someone is doing number two y'all know the difference between number one and number two right just just in case you don't number one is PP number two is poo poo Okay so just in case you did not know but going to a public restroom and someone is doing number two and they will come out and just walk right out of the restroom without washing their hands that's nasty that's nasty or they do number two they come up they turn on the faucet and they just do water on their hands no soap just get some water and then they go over and they're pushing the handle on the paper towel dispenser just getting chocolate all on the paper oh oh I know it's nasty that's why I love motion sensored oh I love the motion sensored yall folks not washing your I ain't got to worry about it I just I just put my hand underneath and the paper towel comes out I love I walk into a restroom the lights aren't on but you walk in and they detect you the motion and the lights turn on and then you can go to the sink so I Ain got to worry about touching the knobs I can just put my hands underneath and the water comes out and I can I can put my hand underneath the soap and just soap comes out and then I go wash my my hands good and I'm not going to get them dirty cuz I got to touch the paper towel dispenser right so I get the paper towel I put it under the motion censored now the only problem is some of these restrooms have doors what handles that I got to pull to leave and you did number two and did not wash your hands or you washed it with water so I got to get another paper towel oh yeah use the paper towel and hopefully you put the trash can near the door because if you didn't a brother can't touch that knob I'm just going to take a jump shot hope it goes in but I love motion censored uh uh the movement the movement the movement it brings the soap it brings the water it activates the paper towels it activates the lights and there are some Miracles that will only be activated in your life by movement today as we continue our series on Miracles I want to speak from this thought your Miracle requires movement your Miracle requires movement there's an incredible story in the Bible that shows us how a woman's movement activated her Miracle let's read it together Mark chapter 5: 24-29 it says so Jesus went with him a large crowd followed and pressed around him and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years she had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had yet instead of getting better she grew worse when she heard about Jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak she she moved she walked towards Jesus she pressed through the crowd to touch his cloak because she thought if I just touch his clothes I will be healed the Bible says immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering this woman was in need of a miracle and she heard that Jesus had arrived in the city she didn't just sit there and say man I hope Jesus sees me I hope Jesus walks past me I I hope Jesus comes my way she didn't say I'm not going to do anything if God wants me to heal it he'll just do it no no no she saw Jesus and she moved towards Jesus she pressed her way through the crowd and touched Jesus there are some Miracles that will only happen because you move towards Jesus you pressed your way towards Jesus there's a blessing in the pressing come on tell your neighbor tell them there's a blessing in the pressing come on tell your other neighbor tell your other neighbor there's a blessing in the pressing your Miracle is on the other side of your movement and the devil will try everything he can to keep you from pressing towards Jesus but no matter what comes your way in life you have to keep moving you have to keep pressing because there's blessing in the pressing number one you have to press past pain this lady has been in pain been bleeding and in pain for 12 years the Bible says over time she only grew worse and worse that the pain continued to increase how many you know pain is no joke pain is is no respector of persons pain doesn't care about your social or economic status your skin color your country your career or the neighborhood you live in no no pain it hits everyone and when it hits it hurts pain paralyzes and it stops so many people from pressing forward and many of you today are facing some serious pain in your life some of you are dealing with physical pain you're living with a the disease sickness chronic pain maybe your family is battling a sickness pain hits and it hurts some of you are dealing with emotional pain you're grieving a loss battling depression worry battling stress anxiety pain hits and it hurts some are dealing with relation pain your marriage is on the Rocks pain of a divorce the pain of betrayal of a friend or family member abuse loneliness some are dealing with financial pain can't pay all of your bills can't retire like you were planning to because your retirement accounts are way down overwhelmed with debt stressed over money career pain pain some some you you lost your job business sales have been declining your job is a struggle your boss or employees are causing you so much pain pain hits and it hurts and what I've learned is it hits and it hurts everybody and pain can either paralyze you or Propel you forward the woman used her pain to propel her forward she heard about Jesus and she pressed through her pain and touched Jesus she knew that her answer the answer to her pain was Jesus and she was going to touch Jesus listen our answer is always Jesus no matter how much pain you're in you have to press towards Jesus church keep moving towards Jesus don't allow your pain to paralyze you I've dealt with relational pain I've dealt with family pain I've had pain that I've dealt with that I wouldn't wish on anybody pain that led to depression anxiety pray pain where I just you ever have moments you wake you just don't even want to face the day you just want to stay in bed and I've just learned that I got to keep pressing into Jesus I've just learned Jesus is the answer it's Jesus I need Jesus I can't do this without Jesus and so no matter what pain I'm going through and facing I'mma keep pressing into Jesus I'mma keep pressing into the Healer I'm going to keep pressing into the Prince of Peace I'm going to keep pressing into hope I you got to press you got to keep pressing press past your pain to Jesus number two you have to press past disappointment the Bible says she went to doctor after doctor and couldn't find an answer to her problem the doctor bills were piling up and she spent all her money trying to find a cure but she only got worse talk about extreme disappointment no one could help her she's broke her health is declining this is a recipe for hopelessness it's a recipe to give up a recipe to quit moving forward see your spiritual enemy will try to use disappointment to stop you from moving towards Jesus let me ask you has a disappointment caused you to stop pressing towards Jesus the dis appointment of your child making horrible decisions it's breaking your heart the disappointment because you thought this is the person you're going to marry and they ended the relationship disappointment because your marriage is in a bad place and you don't see how it could ever get any better disappointment because you keep getting passed over for the promotion disappointment because you're grades are horrible and you feel like a failure disappointment over your prayers you've prayed and nothing has gotten any better you're still sick you're still struggling see the devil wants to use disappointment to stop you from pressing towards Jesus but like this lady in Mark 5 you have to keep pressing past disappointment you have to keep pursuing Jesus with all your heart your Miracle is in your movement there's a blessing in the pressing there's a blessing in the pressing number three you have to press past religion the religious law in those days said this woman was unclean because of her bleeding what that meant was she was not allowed to go out in public she couldn't be around her family her friends or around others in the community she was and Outcast and she definitely wasn't allowed to come to Jesus and touch him see religion will keep you away from Jesus religion will tell you that you've messed up so much you can't come to church and worship Jesus you're too nasty too unclean too unworthy to come to Jesus your sin is so bad you blown it too many times you've made too many mistakes so you need to stay away from Jesus but like this woman don't allow religion to keep you away from Jesus Rel listen listen listen religion says first go clean up but Jesus says come to me messed up Jesus is not afraid of your mess he welcomes your mess don't allow your mess to keep you from pressing into Jesus come on you can't receive a miracle unless you have some mess your mess makes you a candidate for a miracle you got to press past religion I remember when I was in high school and I wasn't living right I was living wild I was partying I was uh had sexual addiction porn I mean you you name it I was the the hot mess Express that I remember feeling like I couldn't come to Jesus I remember feeling like I couldn't even come to church like I had messed up I had made so many mistakes mistakes and even when I first came to church I was nervous I was scared and what made it worse the church I started going to all of a sudden some religious people started talking about me behind my back they started calling me names they started calling me a a heathen dog what's that Heathen dog doing here why is he at our youth group and why is he at our church and they did not want me to come and that was difficult that was hard to hear it made me it made me angry it made me upset but I thank God that I chose to press past religion that I kept coming to that youth group and it took about a year but finally on a Wednesday night at youth group God saved me I gave my life to Jesus and I was changed forever but I had to press past some religion and some religious people to get to Jesus and at 18 years old God saved me he changed me a few months later at the next baptism service I got baptized in water I found out I found that religion hinders people from getting baptized there's people that believe that that that that that oh after you get saved well no you can't get baptized yet you need to go clean some stuff up you need to go make some things right or you are not ready listen that's a lie that's not from God or God's word the only thing you need to get baptized is a relationship with Jesus Christ that's it you get baptized knowing yes you are still a hot mess but you've been saved and forgiven by the Savior and you're letting the whole world know that you gave your life to Jesus that you're all in on Jesus and so I want to encourage some of you because some of you religion or religious people have caused you to believe that you are not ready to get baptized and God saying no yes you are you gave your life to me and so you can text in text in sign up to get baptized next Sunday invite your friends invite your family invite your co-workers invite everybody that you know to see you get baptized for them to know you're still not perfect but you're saved you're saved you've been cleansed you've been redeemed forgiven of all your sin go ahead and invite those religious people that are like you can't getting baptized come and watch me I want to invite you come celebrate with me and so text in today text in get baptized next Sunday don't allow religion or lies from the enemy to hinder you from obeying God and taking this incredible step in your Faith journey of getting water baptized so so sign up and we want to celebrate that with you religion religion religion says go clean up but God says come messed up and then I'll clean you up so we got to press past pain we have to press past disappointment we have to press past religion and then number four we have to press past people the Bible says this lady had to press through a crowd to get to Jesus I can only imagine what she faced as she pressed past people people to get to Jesus I could see some people saying ain't that gerud she got that bleeding thing y' hey yo heyy hey gerud hey don't touch me y'all Gertrude is over here the bleeding lady I mean I can only imagine the look she was getting the snares and the glares like oh my goodness she coming in she got that blood issue coming around oh my God you getting there Jesus oh I can't watch I can imagine the shame the guilt because the Bible says the proud the crowd was pressed against Jesus and she's bumping with sne and gasps and people looking at her but she pressed past the people to get get to Jesus some of you you need to press past some people number one you need to press past negative influences some of you you are surrounded by the wrong people the crowd you're running with is going to keep you stuck in an addiction stuck in bad habits stuck making Bast bad choices you got to press past the negative influence get some positive and godly people in your life so that you can be healed some of you been praying oh God take away the pain and God's like if you would just get away from those people I promise you I promise you give us some godly people positive people number two you got to press past doubters some of you have doubters in your ear they keep doubting what God can do in your life they keep telling you you believe in miracles you're not going to receive a miracle your situation will never change why are you still praying why are you still going to church why are you serving why are you tithing why are you you tell me you believe the Bible you really believe that book you really believe in God you think Church serving praying you really think that's going to help you it's not working for you

don't let your haters paralyze you you got to press and then number four you got to press past yourself when you're waiting on a miracle you can get weary you can get tired you can start to wonder if it's really worth pressing and moving forward and I want to encourage your heart today it's worth it it's worth it it's worth it don't stop pressing don't give up there's a blessing in the pressing your movement your your Miracle requires a movement keep on pressing past press past the pain press past the disappointment press past religion press past press past the people and get to Jesus the

your public purpose and to start off this message I have a very very important question to ask you how many of you believe that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time how many y'all believe MJ is the goat okay I'm seeing a good amount of hands okay how many of you think LeBron is the goat oh okay we seeing they're still raising their hand after what happened last night that's all right that's all right all right we got some listen both of them incredible players I mean changed the game but in my humble opinion Michael Jordan is the goat he's he he is Michael was just so clutch how many saw the shot if you don't know what I'm talking about I got a picture I think it's I think it come on everybody everybody remember this one the the shot this happened on May 7th 1989 the Cales and Bulls are facing each other it's a 2 two series it's tied up the winner advances and in the last minute of this game the lead changes six times I mean your heart is just racist and the Bulls are down one point with 3 seconds to go and so they they pass it in and Jordan gets it he dribble dribble jumps and as you can see the shot there shoots it swishes it and he does that celebrate if I was limber y I would do it but you know where he runs and he jumps like three feet in the air and it's pumping his fist and the Bulls win Michael Jordan with this game-winning shot thousands upon thousands saw it live many people have gone on YouTube and watched the shot and here's what I want you to know about the shot before the masses would see it on May 7th no one saw Michael Jordan in an empty gym practicing over and over and over and over again see what the people people saw in public Jordan had already prepared for in private and that's what I want to talk to you about today as we continue our series stay in your lane preparing for your purpose and we've been looking at the life of David and we're seeing how God had a purpose for David and just like God had a purpose for David God has a plan and a purpose for you and me and David was more committed to his purpose than to position prominence or promotion and just like David if we're going to fulfill God's purpose for our lives we're going to have to prepare for it and specifically I want us to focus today on how important it is to handle our private lives well in order to prepare for our public purpose like Jordan what we do when no one knows and no one sees those daily decisions personal disciplines will determine whether or not we fulfill our purpose and David he gives us so much to learn from matter of fact we know a lot about David's Private Life by reading the Psalms in a way when you read the Psalms it's like reading his personal Journal I'm actually in the Psalms right now for my devotions and I love love just reading about David and love just seeing his faith but also just seeing how raw and how real he is with God in the Psalms and see long before David became the greatest king in Israel he was away from the spotlight he was out in the field watching sheep it wasn't glamorous but it was critical in shaping him to become who God created him to be and when it came time to be the King David was prepared the question we're asking in this series is are you prepared for the purpose that God has prepared for you are you prepared for the purpose God has prepared for you and today I want to give you three ways to lead your private life that will help lead you in fulfilling God's purpose the the first way is this guard your heart from the things that dull your spiritual sensitivity guard your heart from the things that dull your spiritual sensitivity Proverbs 4: 23 it says above all else everybody say Above All Else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it and David did that David knew that what was in the well would come up in the bucket and so David paid attention to the things that could influence his heart he he knew that his personal friends would impact his purpose and so we knew he had to guard his heart when it came to relationships look at Psalm 1 David said blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that Sinners take or sit in the company of mockers David knew it was in part important to guard what came into his eyes Psalm 1013 David said I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar if you and I are going to fulfill our purpose we have to pay attention to what's coming into our heart and our eyes are an Avenue to the heart above all else got to guard your heart got to guard your heart when we first move back to Indianapolis one morning we woke up and I went downstairs and I couldn't find my laptop I'm like man I swear I left my laptop on the couch Jamie she was upstairs where's where's my laptop I don't know where'd you last put it I thought I'd put it on the couch because sometimes if I leave things where they're not supposed to be Jamie I'll take them and move them and put them where they're supposed to be but so I'm looking everywhere I'm my kid Jace did you touch my laptop no D Jamie comes downstairs and she's looking and then she's like where's my laptop I'm like what do you mean she's like I know I left it on the kitchen table last night then Jamie goes and her purse is on the chair there she's like Chris I think somebody's been in my purse and she pulls out her wallet my credit cards are gone I'm like Oh my goodness and I had my I had my little wallet on the counter shown of when my wallet my credit cards were gone we go into the garage thankfully the cars were still there but the garage door was open we had left the garage door open all night and while we were sleeping somebody came in stole credit cards stole our laptops too many people people they are leaving the door to their hearts wide open and the enem is coming to steal they're leaving it wide open to all kinds of influences that will keep them from God's purpose for their life some things are obvious I mean they're just sinful lying cheating stealing but there are a lot of other areas that will cause you to lose your spiritual Edge they will dull your spiritual sense positivity in Corinthians Paul writes this that not everything that is permissible is beneficial not everything that's permissible is beneficial what does that mean some things you can do but shouldn't do some things may not send you to jail but they'll keep you from your purpose be careful about the little seeds that produce weeds Above All Else guard your your heart be wise in what you choose for entertainment it may not send you to hell but it may dull your spiritual Edge be careful about what voices are in your life just because it's not a sin to hang out with them doesn't mean it's smart guard your heart not everything that is permissible is beneficial be wise in where you go be wise in what you watch ask yourself this question is this feeding my love for God or giving me an appetite for things that pull me away from God's purpose is this feeding my love for God or is this giving me an appetite for things that are pulling me away from God's purpose be wise in what you read I remember back in youth group they used to say garbage in garbage out garbage in garbage out students be wise with who you hang out with right now who you hang they have the most influence in are they bringing you closer to Jesus or are they pulling you away from his plan and his purpose you got to guard your heart and so how do we because again there's some obvious things that are like okay I know I should not do that but then there's some other things that maybe aren't so obvious how do we even know couple things number one you got to listen to the conviction of the Holy Spirit you're like what is that that's that's where you're doing something you're maybe at someplace or you're somewhere or you're watching or you're listening and it's not settling well in your spirit there's something there the holy spirit is telling you no this is not good for uh your life matter of fact I just just just this week uh we were trying to find a anybody ever get in a show Hole I was in a show Hole I needed a new show and so was on Netflix and I started watching this show and there's just some of it of just some of the language and different things it just it wasn't settling right in my spirit but it was but it was so good oh I Want To Know How It Ends the twists and the turns but the more I just realize I just man you know I don't need this I don't need this now listen when I was a new I didn't know what the conviction of the Holy Spirit was I was trying to find Matthew in the Bible you know what I mean like I I just thought I had some bad spaghetti I wouldn't have known and so listen if you're like but I don't know if I'm really Discerning what the what the conviction of the Holy Spirit L you need to get a Godly wise person in your life that you trust that you can ask questions that you can say hey do you see any areas in my life where I'm not God in my heart that you can talk to about the things you're watching the things you're seeing the places that you're going to you get get somebody like that in your life I I I I I I remember I had a a Godly Mentor in my life and and and they were like man I don't think you should keep going to parties I'm like what do you mean I'm witnessing at these parties I'm not drinking anymore I'm good but I'm leading people to Jesus really tell me about it oh yeah they're drunk they're like man Chris man I'm G get Jesus like you man man I'm so proud of you I'll be at church on Sunday man I just I just love man so good you're like what happened the next day well they didn't really remember the conversation May you're not guarding your heart you shouldn't be going to those parties and getting the convict list is something to grow in it's something to grow in spiritually the closer you get to God you're going to be able to sense the leading and The Guiding and the conviction of the Holy Spirit some of you are sensing it out but you may not realize but it's just good to have some godly people in your life that can help you to guard your heart because I'm telling you the enemy he is Sly he's a deceiver he'll do whatever he can to lure you away and he can take things that we can even think that are okay or not so bad and we can get a little compromise in it and he'll do all he can to dull Our Lives spiritually to keep us away and distracted from God's given purpose for our life and we got to we got to guard our hearts your private life is preparation for your public purpose your private life is preparation for your public purpose it matters who you are and the choices you make when no one is looking will determine the life you live when the world is watching number two the the the second way is fill your life with things that align your heart with God's to prepare for our purpose it's not just a matter of what we need to keep out of our private lives but it's also what we put in let's look at David a couple things that David put in his life first David feasted on the word of God Psalm 19 that whole chapter it's crazy long it's all about the word of God but just two verses in there verse 97 verse 103 verse 97 he says oh how I love your law I meditate on it all day long verse one 103 he says how sweet are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth he was hungry for the word we got to be hungry for it and and fill our lives up W with with the word of God Psalm 11911 David said I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you he knew that in order to follow God's purpose he would have to follow God's law he would have to follow God's word and the only way you're going to be able to follow God's word is if you know God's word and and the only way you can hide it is for you to know it to read it to memorize it to Feast on it and so I want to encourage you every day every morning fill up your life with God's word read the Bible every day get a get a translation that you like the you can go the NIV or the the NLT those are those are great translations and and yet there's other ones out there but get a translation that you understand find a a reading plan on the Bible app do it with some friends or some family start each day by filling your life with the word of God it's that daily habit that personal private study that will keep you on the path to God's purpose David feasted on God's word secondly David sought the face of god let's look back to his journal Psalm 278 he says my heart says of you seek his face your face Lord I will seek listen you will discover more about God's purpose for Your Life by spending time in his presence than taking personality tests and self-evaluation nothing wrong with those things go ahead figure out you're an any any gr 20 leftwing two whatever it is I don't even understand go do all I'm all for it do to any in due to due to the the uh disc the Myers Briggs strength finders whatever else they got one for the the disciples which disciple are you do all that's great but I'm telling you none of that will compare to sitting in God's presence and listening to his voice none of that will compare to praying and talking with God and hearing from God those things are good but none of them will compare to talking and listening to God David spent many hours out in the fields in the presence of God and it prepared him for what was ahead get In God's Presence find your find what makes you com how do you connect with God everybody's a little bit different for me I love worship y'all I will find a song and I will play that thing on repeat all day in the morning I'll play it do my I drive Jamie crazy she's like how can you keep listening to that music and that same song over and over that's not how jimie connects best with God Jamie likes complete silence in a cup of coffee M that's what she does you mean the first thing your wife does is get a cup of coffee before she spends time with the Lord yes because that's how she spend times with the Lord she gives her coffee and she wants complete quiet I got the same song playing so will I mean I just over we can't do our devotions together okay it's just you got to you gotta you got to find it maybe it's worship maybe it's a walk maybe it's being in nature maybe it's when you're driving in the car I don't know maybe you need a a nice blanket a a nice spot in in the house but but but but get in his presence get in his presence David sought the face of God thirdly David loved God's house let's look back at his journal Psalm 268 Lord I love the house where you live the place where your glory dwells David loved the house of God do you love God's house Psalm 27:4 David said the one thing I ask of the Lord the thing I seek most is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life delighting in the Lord's Perfections and meditating in his Temple I love how the message paraphrase uh States Psalm 8410 it says one day spent in your house this beautiful place of worship beats thousands spent on Greek Island beaches I'd rather scrub floors in the house of my God then be honored in the guest as a guest in the place of sin listen God this is a place of preparation start your week off every week every week every Sunday success starts on Sunday every Sunday be in God's house come on we got three services if you stayed up late watching that Lakers Nuggets game we got this 11 o'clock or 12:30 for you come on some students had prom and some of them are at church today come on give it up for these Mighty students that's what I'm talking about some of them are still sleeping I hope to see them at 12:30 but that's why we got a 12:30 if you got days later you getting ready for the Pacers first playoff game in a long time I got to get cooking all day you can come to the 9:30 and cook all the way up to 7 but be in God's house have a love and a commitment David loved he was in his house be here be here every Sunday it's a it's a place of preparation and then number three learn to lead your thoughts learn to lead your thoughts this one's so important so many battles are lost and won with our mind David I mean think about the mental battles David could have had he could have been jealous of his brothers he could have had a sour o sour attitude felt overlooked under appreciated matter of fact when you read through the Psalms you see times where David is confused he's scared he's worried he's frustrated he's a you you you see all of that but you know what you also see all the time but I trust in you Lord but I trust in you but I trust in you I worship you I praise you David kept his head on straight how did he do it back to his journal Psalm 112 blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that Sinners take or sit in the company of mockers verse two but whose Delight is in the law of the Lord and who meditates on his law day and night he meditated on the word of God he didn't just avoid bad places and he didn't even just appreciate the word of God he filled His Thoughts with God's word and God's ways day and night he processed the goodness of God day and night he thought long and hard about the way the ways of God there are things things we don't want in our heart there are things we do need in our lives but what about the things you don't ask for what about those thoughts The Temptations you never ask for you ever been there you're like where did that thought come from I shake my head sometimes I'm like whoa where what do you do with the things you didn't ask for thoughts Temptations see you can't control every thought that hits your mind but you have to deal with them and you have to deal with him appropriately 2 Corinthians 105 it says we demolish arguments and every pretense that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought and make it obedient to Christ we reject the wrong thoughts and we replace them with the right ones we take every thought captive we reject the lie and we replace it with the truth we replace the ideas of taking revenge and getting some back at someone that hurt us and we replace them with thoughts of trusting God to defend us we got to reject the wrong thoughts and replace them with the right ones and listen if you're having a hard time doing that get help get help get a Godly friend get in a small group get some Christian counseling if you are buying in and believing and you're like there's so many lies and depression and anxiety and mess and evil in my head I don't even know where to start to begin to replace them listen get some help get some help with some people that will speak the truth and give you the truth and they'll give you the word of God that you can memorize and that you can use to replace every lie that the enemy tries to feed you listen your thoughts what you dwell on what you rehearse over and over and over is so important that's why the Bible says in Colossians 3:2 it says set your minds on things above not on Earthly things Romans 12:2 do not conformed to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is his good pleasing and perfect will Philippians 4:8 finally Brothers whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any Excellence if there is anything worthy of Praise think about these things think about these things we have to learn to lead our thoughts rather than being led by them we have to lead our thoughts not let them lead us God has a purpose for your listen you got to believe that you got to believe God has a purpose and plan for your life you got to believe that every day and it starts in your mind when the devil or anybody tries to tell you you're a nothing you're a nobody you don't have no you got to remind yourself of that truth God has a purpose for your life don't let your mind get fixated on promotion power Prestige come on focus on allying your heart with God's plan for your life don't buy the LIE that we can come up with a better plan for our lives than God his purpose will shatter our best ideas long before there's action there's a battle for your thoughts wi it there you're preparing for your future and all God has planned when you Le learn to lead your thoughts and in order to live out our god-given purpose we got to be prepared in our private life listen we can be so good putting on the show wearing the mask sharing all of our highlights posting all of our our our highlights and be our life be crumbling in private places David was he got prepared in private and I'm telling you right now you can't Overlook it you can't skip it if you'll get prepared in the private if you guard your heart the reality is only you and God know what's really happening in your heart until you tell somebody until then you and God know you got to guard your heart guard your heart guard your heart it's preparation in the private place your private life you got to fill your heart with God his word his ways worship fill up every day fill up fill up in the in the private place in the in the quiet place every say fill up fill up fill up fill up don't run on empty I'm telling you if you are you will break down David didn't break down he was prepared in the private place and then you got to lead your thoughts this mind of ours that is so strong and it is crazy the thoughts that can come in and we cannot let evil impure debilitating sinful sick thoughts ruminate in our mind we can't even rehearse them they get no rehearsals they need to be cast out immediately you got to take them captive and you got to replace it with the truth you got to replace it with God's word listen it it is it is a battle but I'm telling you if you will win the battle in private man don't worry God's going to set up everything that needs to be set up in the public but it's got to start in your private life

and i'll be honest with you i like to be busy i like to work i like being productive i enjoy producing and seeing results but i'll be honest with you i i could be a workaholic if i did not keep myself in check matter of fact busy almost broke me and my marriage when i was a youth pastor at people's church in oklahoma city in my second year my executive pastor had to sit me down because i was working too much he had to sit me down he said chris you should not be working every night this is not good for your family this is not good for your marriage like he literally had to sit me down and give me a talking to because i was working so much it was damaging my marriage it was causing issues in my marriage i was neglecting my family it almost broke my marriage and there have been a time or two where it almost broke me i've had seasons working where i've just been running myself ragged and not taking a sabbath and not taking a break and just go go go where where at times i've had panic attacks because i'm all work and no rest matter of fact there was a sunday when i was in oklahoma city there was a sunday where i had to leave church i had to leave and go to the hospital because i thought i was having a heart attack i remember telling pastor hey i gotta go something's not right i think i'm having a heart attack and so i remember i went to the hospital and they take in and they do all the ekgs and they hook you up to all the monitors and they're testing everything and anything they're saying i'm sorry mr smith there's nothing wrong with you i think you're just having a panic attack how's your sleep how's your schedule and as they started asking me these questions i was embarrassed because i wasn't sleeping well i wasn't resting i wasn't taking time off i was running myself ragged and it was it was it was busy busy almost broke me and my marriage and according to a lot of research we did many people are wrecking their life with busyness the cdc said that over the past four years physical over exertion has been the second leading cause of injury and illness since the year 2000 heart disease has gone up by 42 percent because people are so busy scholar joel go estimates that workplace stress contributes to at least a hundred and twenty thousand deaths annually one article said being too busy creates a chronic stress response people experience physical manifestations of stress that are indicators that life is too busy ignoring these indicators can cause burnout disease and damage the body long term the most common physical indicators include fatigue sleep problems including feeling exhausted and insomnia chest pain or heart palpitations panic attacks headaches gastrointestinal discomforts such as cramps stomach aches indigestion constipation and diarrhea i sound like a pepto-bismol commercial right now being too busy will break you not bless you being too busy will break you not bless you corey ten boom once said that if the devil can't make you bad he'll make you busy so true see the devil wants to keep you busy because he wants to break you god wants to bless you but the devil wants to break you and i want to give you four quick indicators to help you recognize that the devil has you too busy the the first one is stress too busy creates stress i just read you several statistics about stress and you have to be honest with yourself are you stressed out do you have some of the signs of being stressed out too busy leads to stress and health issues number two too busy cancels joy and peace when you're too busy joy and peace will be sucked right out of your life some of you you don't have joy and peace and you can't figure out why you're like i go to church i pray you read your bible and yet you don't have joy and peace perhaps your pace is robbing your peace perhaps juggling all the balls of life are robbing you of the joy of life too busy cancels joy and peace number three too busy crushes productivity have you ever talked to someone who always talks about being busy but they aren't productive you know what i'm talking about whoo i'm busy what'd you get done oh no i'm just so busy just busy busy where'd you get the work project done no i'm but i'm busy did you get your homework done no but i'm busy being too busy it crushes productivity and then number four too busy corrodes connection one of the key signs that you're too busy is your connections are corroding your relationship with your spouse is eroding you're drifting away from your spouse because you're too busy to connect your relationship with your kids is lacking you don't have time to spend with them to attend their activities to help them when they're struggling you're impatient with them because you're busy your relationship with friends are missing your your your your connections are corroding you don't have time for friendships you're too busy to be in a small group you hear about small group launch today and you're like i'm just too busy for that i'm i'm not stopping by those groups i'm just you just think you're too busy for christian friendships and you're right and here's the deal that's what the devil wants he wants you to be too busy he wants you to isolate from other christians because he wants to pick you off busy is it's breaking relationships you're so busy you don't have time to spend with god you're too busy to pray you're too busy to come to church it's the four week challenge and for some of you it feels like the 20 week challenge like oh geez four weeks in a row hour and 10 minutes i'm busy i don't know and i'm concerned that our busy lives are causing so many people to to miss out on what matters most it's causing our kids and teenagers to miss out on what matters most getting the right priorities in our life of god and and family and our relationship with god and his plan and and so the question is what causes us to get too busy for what really matters in life what causes us to get so busy that we create stress we cancel joy and peace we we we crush our productivity we corrode our connections and so i want to answer that question by looking at a story in the bible and learn some of the root causes of why we get too busy luke chapter 10 verse 38-42 it says as jesus and his disciples were on the way he came to a village where a woman named martha opened her home to him she had a sister called mary who sat at the lord's feet listening to what he had asked but martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made she came to him and asked lord don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself tell her to help me martha martha the lord answered you are worried and upset about many things but few things are needed or indeed only one mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her i want to give you three reasons we get too busy for what really matters the first reason is this we believe busy is better we believe busy is better if you ask someone how they are doing everybody says i'm busy i'm busy i got a lot going on i'm busier than a mosquito on the beach at spring break oh i'm busier than the weatherman in a tornado i'm busier than a walmart on black friday i'm so busy my head is spinning i don't even know what day of the week it is and it's like it's like busy has become a badge of honor we brag about being busy matter of fact we one up each other man i'm busy oh you think you're busy hey let me hey i'll show you busy let me tell you about let me tell you how busy i was this it's become this badge of honor and martha martha was busy in verse 40 martha told jesus to tell mary to help her tell her to stop sitting at your feet tell her to get tell her to get busy helping me see martha believed that being busy was better than sitting at the feet of jesus see our belief about busy will dictate our behavior about busy what is it in your belief system that's driving you to live busy see your enemy the devil he traffics in deception and he gets you to believe something that isn't true that will lead to behavior that isn't healthy let me give you an example the devil told eve in the book of genesis that if she ate from fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden that she would get to be just like god but that was a lie eve was already created in the image of god she didn't need to eat that that fruit to be like god she was created in his image but she believed the lie and it led to behavior that wasn't healthy for her life and that's exactly how the devil operates he gets you to believe a lie that leads you to a behavior that isn't healthy let me give you three lies the devil wants you to believe about busy the first lie is the people lie like martha telling mary that busy and better is better our culture tells us that busy is better being busy is what our culture values our culture can make you feel like you're a human doing instead of a human being do do do work work work scroll scroll scroll go go go run run run busy busy busy it's the people lie number two is the performance lie people believe they have to perform to be valuable i wonder if martha was struggling with feeling like she needed to perform for jesus i wonder if she felt jesus will think i'm special if he sees how busy i am he'll notice me see some of you are busy because you believe you're more valuable when you're performing people will notice me validate me pat me on my back and you're getting your value from your performance you believe you have to perform to be valuable it's it's a lie and and the third lie is the production lie i wonder if martha thought i'm more valuable when i'm producing than when i'm sitting with jesus i have to produce to be valuable see some of you are busy because you're getting your value for your production i have to work 68 hours a week my kids are in five activities and three sports teams apiece i have to work every night of the week if i produce i'm valuable check out some of the most popular hashtags on social media in 2022. on my grind can't stop won't stop grinding daily grind rise and grind working late work hard work is life no days off the devil will have you believing a lie that leads you to behavior that's breaking your life not blessing your life let me give you the second reason that we get too busy for what matters in life number two is we compare ourselves to others martha was so busy because she was comparing herself to mary her attention was on mary more than it was on jesus and some of you you're busy because your attention is more on people than it is on jesus you're busy with things that aren't your business you're so busy because you're always in someone else's business look what first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 11 says it says make it your goal to live a quiet life minding your own business listen to break out of busyness you have to mind your own business you have to get out of other people's business i don't have time to be worried about your marriage i'm working on mine i don't have time to worry about how your kids are doing i'm busy raising mine i don't have time to worry about your money your car your home your vacation your job because i'm too busy taking care of my business see the fastest way to kill what god is doing in your life is to compare your life to someone else's life comparison is an act of violence against yourself it's an act of violence against yourself because you're always comparing your beginning with someone else's middle and then you're comparing your middle with someone else's end you have to stop comparing yourself to others it's like when you're driving down the road it's a two lane and you're driving and you're minding your own business but all of a sudden you see this car just kind of speeding up and all of a sudden you start speeding up you know just you gotta be a little ahead of them get your front end a little uh in front of theirs and all of a sudden they start speeding up and you see what they try oh they're trying to beat me to the light i don't think and this is what we're doing in life we're always comparing world was looking we always got to one up we always got to be a little bit faster we got to beat him to that stoplight and that's what's happening in life listen galatians chapter six verse four and five it says it says pay careful attention to your own work for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else for we are each responsible for our own conduct stop comparing yourself to others i need to work three thousand hours a week because they are i need to have my kids in three different sports and activities at one time because they do i need to go on that vacation because they did i need that car because they have one i need a bigger house because they have one i can skip my kids games and dance recitals because they do i can live busy busy busy because they do comparison it's an act of violence against yourself number three let me give you the third reason here is we are easily distracted from what really matters we're easily distracted from what really matters luke 10 verse 41 to 42 martha martha the lord answered you are worried and upset about many things but few things are needed or indeed only one mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her so many of us we are just like martha we are worried and upset about many things but only a few things are really needed listen it's easy to get focused on things that don't really matter jesus said mary has chosen what is better let me ask you are you choosing what's better or has the devil distracted you from better by getting you worried and upset about many things you think you're busy striving after success but after you've but you've actually lost sight of what really matters and you're sabotaging your success when you lose sight of what matters you sabotage your success i want to give you five stages as i close five stages to sabotaging your success the first is hubris this is a this is having a foolish amount of pride or confidence where we tell ourselves and others that we know best i'm busy because it's best i have to do it if i don't do it nobody else is gonna i'm the only one that can do it this is on me it's all happening because of me and listen you need to hear me pride is the source of so much of our busyness i'm gonna do one whole message about in this series about how pride is the source of so much busyness do not miss one week of this series here's the the first stage is hubris it's pride here's the second stage it's a life mismanagement and bad habits proverbs 17 24 an intelligent person aims at wise action but a fool starts off in many directions and this is where we find martha and this is where so many of you are you are running in so many different directions that you are on the verge of sabotaging your success because of life mismanagement your schedule and your life they are spinning out of control the third stage is indulgence and compromise when your life is spinning out of control you start believing you deserve the indulgence or the compromise i'm so busy i'm working so hard i deserve the pornography the flirting with someone who's not my spouse i deserve the affair i deserve the pills i deserve the excess drinking hear me you're about to sabotage your success luke 21 34 it says watch out don't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness and by the worries of this life don't let that day catch you unaware the fourth stage then is isolation and secrecy what happens next is you pull away from relationships you stop serving on the dream team you stop going to your small group you stop hanging out with other christians you start to isolate and your secrets begin to grow and grow and grow and grow psalm 32 3 it says when i refused to confess my sin my body wasted away and i groaned all day long and then the fifth stage is self-deceived people who sabotage their own success are self-disease self-deceived they believe i can keep running at this unhealthy pace because everybody needs me my life mismanagement my bad habits aren't as bad as other people my indulgence are areas of compromise they aren't that bad come on i i deserve it it's not going to hurt anyone it's my little secret no no no you're self-deceived your life is out of control proverbs 27 12 it says the prudent see danger and take refuge but the simple keep going and pay the penalty today some of you don't see the danger but god sent me to tell you you're in danger you don't see that you're redlining you're pushing too hard your schedule and your life is out of control listen please don't miss a week of this series this series is going to change your life your marriage your family your relationships it's going to change your your work situation i'm telling you don't miss one week some of you you're seeing the danger and the question is will you take refuge will you change or will you be simple and keep going will you keep going with your busyness keep going with your busy schedule busy with kids activities keep going with your busy work schedule keep going with your bad habits keep going with your stress keep going when you're worn out if you just keep going you will break your life and not bless your life god wants to bless your life the enemy wants to break it and he will use and he is using busyness to break us to break homes to break relationships to break our faith and so listen we got the prudent they see danger and they take refuge would you take refuge don't miss one week of this service don't be like the simple and keep going because if you keep going you'll break your life not bless your life
Ul-16Hkjm-Y,well today we are kicking off this brand new series called good God that even in the midst of trouble when times are hard God is still and always will be good and it can be tough to see

getting into that time of the year where major holidays are right around the corner and there are a lot of good things to eat come on Thanksgiving we're just four weeks away I love Thanksgiving and I

had to ham like marinating in it and she is winning me I'm still team turkey but she is working hard with that ham to win me over okay here's another one is it dressing or first of all people I guess these are different dressing or stuffing and some people don't call it the right thing and so some people are like no they they're correcting you that's not dressing that stuffing or no that's not stuffing that's dressing okay so if you're like me I don't even know to do I don't like either one of them so praise the Lord so I'm not raising my hand but where are my dressing Folks at where my

all right where I am no eggnog where my eggnog Folks at where my eggnog okay okay where am I no eggnog people yeah yeah I'm like it's just so thick so thick hey but y'all hey you go ahead you like it get past the eggnog milkshake and egg you eggnog it up and as you can tell I'm excited y'all Jamie is going to be making a spread for Thanksgiving and there will be so much good food on the table and if I don't taste and enjoy that food it's my fault because the table will be full of food and God has a table full of goodness for your life and if you don't taste his goodness it's not God's fault it's your fault God has set the table full but you have to taste and see what keeps people from tasting the goodness of God first is this we doubt the goodness of God we doubt the goodness of God James chapter 1 verse 16 and 17 it says don't be deceived my dear brothers and sisters every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of the Heavenly lights who does not change like shifting Shadows James tell us tells us not to be deceived because it's easy to be deceived and to begin doubting the goodness of God James explains how we become deceived if you read James 1 if you read verses 2 through 12 he says we must have the right perspective when we Face trials and trouble and Trauma he says that when we Face trials to consider them pure joy because God uses our trials to work something good in our life and when you have the right perspective on your trials troubles and Trauma you will have the right perspective of God then in verses 13 and 15 James says the wrong person it says the wrong perspective on Temptation will deceive you into believing that God isn't good he says God never tempts you to sin it's your own desires that tempt you and drag you into sin and if you have the wrong perspective on Temptation it will lead you to believe that God isn't good see the right perspective is to understand that we experience trials trouble trauma and Temptation because we live in a fallen world because Adam and Eve sinned In The Garden of even all Humanity now struggles with sin we're all tempted by evil desires and there's a real devil that tempts us and the devil is behind all of the evil and the chaos that we see in this world but in the midst of our trials trouble trauma and temptations we can start thinking if God was good then I wouldn't be seeing all these problems in my life and in the world look at the mess in this world the war the genocide child sex trafficking murder hate division starvation earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes tsunamis why do I have cancer why did my spouse leave me why did my child die why did my parent abuse me why is there so much evil how could God be good with all this craziness in our world and you have to understand that the Devil is bad and God is good hear me Church the Devil is bad and God is good and James says don't be deceived by the trials the trouble the trauma and temptations every good and perfect gift is from above it comes from God Point number two to taste and see the goodness of God you must believe God is good see God depends on nothing or no one for his goodness he is good all by himself mankind has no goodness outside of God and God has no goodness outside of himself the Bible defines God's goodness in two ways Psalm 119 verse 68 it says you are good and do only good you are good and do only good the the first focuses on his character God is good that's just who he is but the second it focuses on his action God does good so God is good and God does good first let's look at God is good God's nature is goodness God is the original definition of good there's no evil in God there's no bad in God he is good in and of himself for us humans goodness is an added quality but it comes naturally for God because God's nature is goodness that's exactly what Jesus was describing in The Book of Mark look at Mark chapter 10 verse 17 and 18 it says as Jesus started on his way A man run up ran up to him and fell on his knees before him good teacher he asked what must I do to inherit eternal life why do you call me good Jesus answered no one is good except God Alone God Alone is good because that's his nature if I had a lemon up here and I cut the lemon open and I squeezed the lemon what would come out of it lemon juice because that's its nature if you were to squeeze God goodness would come out because goodness is his nature that's who he is the Bible tells us this over and over again look at at first chronicles 16 34 it says give thanks to the Lord for he is good second chronicles 5 13 it says the trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the Lord accompanied by trumpet symbols and other instruments the singers raised their voices in praise to the Lord and saying he is good II Chronicles 7 3 and they worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord saying he is good Ezra 3 4 with praise and thanksgiving they sang to the Lord he is good Psalm 105 for the Lord is good Psalm 106 1 praise the Lord give thanks to the Lord for he is good Psalm 107 1 give thanks to the Lord for he is good Psalm 118 1 give thanks to the Lord for he is good Psalm 135 3 praise the Lord for the Lord is good Psalm 136 1 give thanks to the Lord for he is good God's very nature is goodness and the way you see the true character of a person is by their actions and so the second way the Bible defines God's goodness is by focusing on what God does Psalm 119 68 it says God you are good and you do good you are good and you do good you are good and you do good God's actions are good James says every good and perfect gift comes from the father of heavenly lights Heavenly lights helps us understand that God only has light in him there's no darkness in God God is good so he only does good God gives us so many good gifts he's better to us than we deserve he's constantly showering down his kindness his Mercy his grace his love his generosity upon us that the Bible says it like this in Psalm 13 6 I will sing the Lord's praise for he has been good to me God does Goods psalm 16 2 I said to the Lord you are my master every good thing I have comes from you Psalm 86 5 oh Lord you are so good so ready to forgive so full of unfailing love for all who ask for your help God pours out forgiveness and love because he does good Psalm 116 7 it says return to your rest my soul for the Lord has been good to you God does good Psalm 145 verse 7 it says everyone will share the story of your wonderful goodness I I have so many stories I could share with you about God's goodness in my life Psalm 145 9 it says the Lord is good to all he has compassion on all he has made Isaiah 63 verse 7 that says I will tell of the kindness of the Lord the Deeds for which he is to be praised according to all the Lord has done for us yes the many good things he has done for Israel come on who can testify that God hasn't just done many good things for Israel but he's done many good things for you you got a testimony in this place that God's been good to you come on he woke you up this morning you got food in your fridge and you got clothes on your back you got a roof over your head come on he set you free he's healed you he's protected you he's delivered you does anybody have a testimony that God's been good he's been good he's been good and not only is God good but you have to believe that God is good all the time God is good all the time James said God does not change like shifting Shadows this is hard for us to wrap our mind around because everything is constantly shifting and changing around us the temperature is always changing technology is constantly changing your kids and spouse have changed your job has changed your boss has changed your homes have changed culture is changing this is in the 1970s or the 1990s you are changing you are aging but God hasn't changed he has not and he will not change let me break this down for you how God is unchanging first God's existence is unchanging Psalm 102 27 it says but you are the same and your years have no end God's character is unchanging Psalm 136 verse 1 it says give thanks to the Lord for he is good for his steadfast love endures forever God's character is unchanging his love his grace his Mercy his kindness his goodness is unchanging God's truth is unchanging Isaiah 40 verse 8 the grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of our God endures forever people's views change their beliefs change their truth is constantly changing but God's word never changes God's truth never changes it endures forever God's plans and purposes are unchanging Psalm 33 11 it says but the plans of the Lord stand firm forever the purposes of his heart through all generations the purposes and the plans of God will stand forever God does not change God's son is unchanging Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the songwriter said it this way great is thy faithfulness oh God my father there is no shadow of turning with thee thou changes not thy compassions they fail not as thou Hast been thou forever will be what I want you to understand is God doesn't change so God is good all the time and all the time God is good God is good all the time and all the time God is good and so how should we respond to a good God I want to give you three ways to respond to the goodness of God First Peter chapter 2 verse one through three it says therefore rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit hypocrisy envy and slander of every kind like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow up everybody say grow up you may grow up in your salvation now that you have tasted that the Lord is good when you taste and see that the Lord is good your response should be to grow up in your salvation God you are so good I want to grow I want to be more like you I want to change because you're so good to me you're so good to me I want to grow let me give you three quick areas to grow in number one is grow in Purity grow in Purity Peter said get rid of malice and deceit hypocrisy envy and slandered people who taste and see that the Lord is good are people of repentance they're constantly getting rid of sin and bad habits they crave spiritual milk they want to live for God they want to honor God they want to live pure they want to live holy they want to live for God not have to live for God God you've been so good to me I want to live for you I want to repent I want to serve you I want to love you with all my heart I want to love people I mean God sometimes I want to cuss him out and tell them that they're a dirty dog but God I'll win your goodness I want to love people I I want to get rid of malice envy and slander and love people I want to grow in Purity come on look at your neighbor and say God is so good so grow up come on just tell them right now God is so good so grow up all right he's so good so grow uh wants us to grow in Purity number two is to grow In Worship when you taste and see the goodness of God it makes you grow in your Worship You Want To Worship a good God it's not I have to worship but I want to worship because God is so good Psalm 13 6 it says I will sing the Lord's praise for he has been good to me Psalm 106 1 it says praise the Lord give thanks to the Lord for he is good listen I lift my voice and I raise my hands and I worship with my whole heart because God is so good the worship Pastor doesn't have to tell me to worship they don't have to increase they don't have to tell me to lift my I want to worship and lift my hands and sing and praise God because he is so good I want to not just in church but in my car and in my home I want to worship him he has been so good he is worthy of all my praise I want to worship him I listen I Will Bless The Lord at all times and his praise will continually be in my mouth he's a good God so I'm growing in worship it's not have to I want to like I want to I can't wait to worship I want to worship so we grow and worship how do we respond to the goodness of God and then number three is grow in generosity grow in generosity a huge reason we give to God and his kingdom is because God has been good to us one of the reasons Christians don't grow in generosity is because they don't realize how good God has been to them David talked about this he gave and the people of Israel gave to build the temple of God because God had been good to them look at First Chronicles chapter 29 verse 12-14 it says wealth and honor come from you you are the ruler of all things in your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all now our God we give you thanks and praise your glorious name but who am I and who are my people that we should be able to give as generously as this everything comes from you and we have given you only what comes from your hand David realized something that's so easy for us to forget wealth and honor come from God everything we have comes from God and David realized what James also realized and that's every good and perfect gift comes from God above we give to God and his kingdom because God first gave to us we grow in generosity to God because he has given so much to us we want to give to God's Kingdom not we have to give because God's been so good to us how could I be stingy and greedy to a god who's been so good to me how could I be stingy and greedy with a god who's been so so good to me I want to grow in my generosity because God is so good second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 7 it says but since you excel in everything in faith in speech in knowledge in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you see that you also excel in this grace of giving church I want us to excel in our giving I want us to grow in generosity if you're not tithing start giving 10 percent of your income to God through the local church because he's been so good to you grow in generosity excel in the grace of giving if you're a tither start giving above your tithe to Dream Builders and help us meet needs locally nationally and globally because God has been so good to you grow and Excel in the grace of giving I want all of us to begin to pray and plan for the miracle offering on December 4th if you're new with us our Miracle offering goes to accelerate the vision of people's Church to accelerate the missions that we give locally nationally and globally it's going we are looking for a new building we are knocking on doors and and so it goes to help us buy that new building when God opens up that door and so would you begin to just pray and ask God what he would have you give over and above your tithe on December 4th in the the miracle offering listen because God has been so good to us we want to give not have to give I want to give I want to grow in Purity I want to grow in worship I want to grow in generosity because God is so so good he's been so so good to me and you and so let's grow in Purity let's grow and worship and let's grow in generosity

bad days everybody doesn't know doesn't matter who you are we all have bad days and if you respond the right way to a bad day you can bounce back but if you respond the wrong way to a bad day a bad day can turn into a bad week a bad month a bad year or even a bad decade or a bad life and so we've been learning from the last seven sayings that jesus said on his worst day when he was hung and died on the cross and it's taught us how to bounce back and if you want to watch any of those messages you can go on our youtube page people's church indianapolis and you can go watch those but today we're wrapping up with the final thing jesus said and the title of my message is this is raised to life raised to life and i want to look at the final words that jesus said before he died on the cross and those words are found in john and luke let's look at john first john 19 30 it says when he had received the drink jesus said it is finished with that he bowed his head and gave up his spirit and then luke gives us the count of the very last words jesus said on the cross luke 23 46 it says jesus called out with a loud voice father into your hands i commit my spirit and when he had said this he breathed his last jesus committed his spirit to his heavenly father and then he died on the cross he said it is finished i wonder if you've ever had an it is finished moment you ever had a moment in your life where you thought your life was about to end ever had a moment where you thought it was over ever had a moment where you thought you were getting ready to breathe your last breath i know i had it it is finished moment it came in 2011 2011 at that time we were living in oklahoma city on staff at people's church and in november we were home uh visiting our family on vacation and towards the end of our trip i started to get a really bad uh stomach pain and and i'll be honest with you that night we had gone out to eat at the golden corral and i'm like oh lord never again golden corral i'm like man what did i eat but i wasn't throwing up i didn't have diarrhea but i just had like this this pain and man i just remember it was just keeping me up all night i'm like man is this gas no joke y'all 3 a.m my behind was at walmart getting some gas x i'm like i need some relief what is going on with my stomach that didn't help and so i just had this stomach pain but again i wasn't puking or anything like that and so i set up an appointment i don't like being sick so i set up an appointment with my doctor i had a little bit of fever too and so when i came in actually when i went to the doctor i was starting to start to feel a little bit better and he did all the you know pushing on my stomach and did all the tests and he's like i'm not sure you know what it is he's like you know let's let's have you run some labs and you know just make sure nothing nothing's crazy going on and i'm like okay and so he's like i'll get back to you in a day and so they ran the labs and he was going to get back this is a day we're supposed to be leaving and at this point i'm actually feeling pretty good i really don't have any more uh abdominal pain and so we're we're packing up to drive back to oklahoma city so we got our bags all packed and then i see my phone ringing and it's just a doctor and so i answer it and he's like hey chris um i just want you to know that we got your labs back and on your labs some things were elevated you could have an appendicitis it may be nothing but it could be and so it's it's up to you if you want to come in and we'll do a scan or if not i know you were feeling better now y'all may not know this about me uh but i am a hypochondriac and so i was like oh yeah i'll be coming in right yeah go ahead yeah give me give me that appointment like i need to know i need to know and matter of fact jb was like really babe i'm like i'll just get a test real quick and they're like yeah we can do a scan and we can have the results in an hour hey let's rather be safe than sorry so i go in i get the scan an hour later the doctor calls me back he said hey chris i got your results you are having an appendicitis i need you to go to the surgery center right now don't go to the emergency room it's going to take too long go to the surgery center i have a surgeon waiting there for you and i'm like oh lord oh i remember i'm like i'm also getting my stuff i'm calling jbj i'm gonna die i gotta you like it but at this point i'm like i got a ticking time bomb in my stomach because you know if you're if your appendix ruptures that can be fatal you know what i mean so i am freaking out and so i get to the i'm like where's the where's the surgery room take me in the room they're like no you have to wait i mean wait wait wait this thing could burst at any moment listen we're gonna get you in there and so i'm waiting in there i'm i'm all i'm all anxiety panic attacks i'm like jesus and my son jace he was four at that time he came with jamie he was actually so sweet he's like dad it's gonna be okay let me pray for you and so my four-year-old i'm like okay if he can be strong i can be strong and so finally the doctor comes in they're like great we're ready for you we're going to take you back and and and so when they do the surgery they basically make three incisions and in these incisions they stick in like this this skinny tube that has a camera on it so we can see what they're doing and then these little robotic arms that the doctors like controlling and seeing the camera to to go and take out the appendix and matter of fact the doctor told me that when he got in there my appendix was so close to rupturing that he actually like put a bag over it before they cut it out because they were afraid it was getting ready to to to rupture and listen i don't understand all the science but come on how many all thank god for some technology that saves lives you know what i mean if it weren't for those little robotic arms and those little cameras i might have died i'm thankful that there are there is medicine and there are machines that will that will bring people back to life and easter is all about jesus coming back to life and the incredible thing about the resurrection of jesus christ is no medicine no machine brought jesus back to life it was the power of god that raised him back to life listen and how many all know even if a machine or medicine does bring you back to life you're still going to die someday i mean it's just it's just gonna happen they may bring you back to life multiple times but at some point we all are gonna die but when jesus rose again oh he rose again for good he is alive and well he defeated death hell and the grave he is seated at the right hand of the father and because jesus bounced back to life you can have life god the father ray jesus back to life so you and i could have life look at ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 through 5. it says but god is so rich in mercy and he loved us so much that even though we were dead the bible was talking about being spiritually dead we were spiritually dead because of our sins it says he gave us life when he raised christ from the dead come on jesus was raised back to life so that you can have life everybody shout life oh i think we can do a little better than that everybody shout life god oh that was good god wants to give you life jesus died and rose again to give you life here's the first thing i want you to see today jesus bounced back to life so you can have life jesus bounce back to life so you can have life now not just breathing i'm just talking about breathing and existing but real life see real life comes only through christ look at john chapter 14 verse 6. jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me real life is only experienced through christ you can't experience real life through buddha muhammad or allah or ouija boards or new age you can't experience real life just by going to church or attending mass you can't experience real life just by talking to a preacher or a priest you can't experience new life just by being a good person or doing good deeds real life is found in christ in christ alone it's only found by surrendering your life to jesus john 11 25 it says jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life the one who believes in me will live the one who believes in me will live will have real life even though they die in jesus is real life not just breathing and existing but real life first john 5 12. it says whoever has the son has life real life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life does not have real life see without jesus we don't have real life living life outside of christ it actually brings the opposite of life which is death life without christ brings death life our way brings death trusting in good deeds or in a another person or trusting in religion brings death living a life of sin brings death romans 6 23 it says for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life through christ jesus our lord for the wages of sin always brings death life apart from jesus always brings death the bible says without christ people they are spiritually dead they are spiritually blind and when people are spiritually blind they cannot see with spiritual eyes they can't see the joy that they're missing out on they can't see the love and forgiveness that they're missing out on they can't see the freedom and the peace that they're missing out on they can't see the hope that they're missing out on and today jesus wants to give you real life not only does real life come from christ but secondly new life comes only through christ acts chapter 5 verse 20. it says go stand in the temple courts he said and tell the people about this new life on this easter weekend i want to tell you all about the new life you can have and find in christ because jesus bounced back to life you can live a new life new life is available to you today and you access this new life by giving your life to christ and then you follow christ so first you give your life to christ but then you follow christ see you can't live this new life god has for you if you keep living your old life following jesus means you stop following your old ways you stop following the world's ways you stop following your family and your friends ways and you follow jesus way you follow god's word you follow god you follow his ways and the first thing god tells every christ follower to do after they give their life to christ is to be water baptized people who follow jesus and live a new life in christ get water baptized colossians chapter 2 verse 12 it says for you were buried with christ when you were baptized see water baptism it is a picture of being buried with christ when you go under the water it's showing the whole world that your old life was buried with christ and then when we lift you up out of the water it's showing the whole world you've been raised to new life in christ he says for you were buried with christ when you were baptized it's a powerful moment and it says and with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of god who raised christ from the dead see water baptism doesn't save you but there's something very spiritual that takes place when you're water baptized and people who want to follow jesus and live a new life they get water baptized and so next sunday in all of our services we're doing water baptisms and if you want to follow christ and you want to live a new life of christ be sure at the the end of service to shine up for baptisms next sunday it's a huge moment because baptism is connected to your new life in christ new life comes from christ the bible says in christ we're raised to new life everybody say raised come on jesus is the one he raises us up he lifts us up our lives are raised with jesus with jesus he takes us to higher heights see on my own i can only jump this high y'all think i got hops i see a lot of no's there you're like pastor you know the name of the movie and so but that's all my own that's about as high as i can jump right and like if i get a little running start like that's about as high as i can go right so on my own that's as high as i can jump but somebody made this awesome thing called a trampoline and with a trampoline i can get higher with the trampoline i can jump higher than i can on my own i can reach new heights and when you give your life to christ he'll take you to heights that you can't get on your own he'll take your marriage to new heights you're parenting to new heights you're dating to new heights your career to new heights your faith to new heights oh when you give your life to jesus he'll take you to new heights that you can't get on your own he says he raises you to new life makes you a new person be a new spouse a new leader a new student he makes you new a new employee a new boss a new parent new life comes only through christ secondly jesus bounced back to life so you can have life in the spirit see we have new life because the very moment that we surrender our life to christ god the holy spirit comes and lives inside of us the holy spirit gives us life look at romans chapter 8 verse 11. it says the spirit of god who raised jesus from the dead lives in you and just as god raised christ jesus from the dead he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same spirit living within you look at second corinthians chapter three verse six it says he has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant this is a covenant not of written laws but of the spirit the old written covenant ends in death but under the new covenant the spirit gives life the holy spirit gives us life and you will never experience new life without the holy spirit something will always be missing romans 8 verse 1 and 2 it says so now there is no condemnation for those who belong in christ jesus and because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death the holy spirit gives you new life because now you no longer live with condemnation over your sins that in christ your sins have been forgiven and we have life because the power of the holy spirit because of christ we get pardoned from sin and power over sin pardon from sin and power over sin see the only sin you can truly defeat is forgiving sin and listen i understand that some of us have willpower and i know there's a natural ways to overcome bad habits that aren't based on christ but when changes occur without the forgiveness of christ see the result is your own willpower the bible calls that self-righteousness and the bible says in isaiah 64 6 it says our self-righteousness is like filthy rags we can never depend on our flesh on ourselves to live the new and real life that christ wants us to live john 6 63 it says the spirit gives life the flesh counts for nothing the spirit gives life the flesh counts for nothing the words i have spoken to you they are full of spirit and life our flesh counts for nothing living a life led by the flesh will never produce a real and new life it's in christ alone in the power of the holy spirit that we have a pardon from sin and power over sin you can overcome everybody say overcome you can overcome sin by the power of the holy spirit living inside of you it's his power see a life without christ a life without the holy spirit is like this basketball it's flat something's missing this ball wasn't created to be flat it was created to be full and so this ball just like our life without christ a life without his spirit it's flat there's something missing but here's what happens when you give your life to jesus and you ask jesus to be lord and savior of your life when you give your heart and life to him all of a sudden now you get full of the holy spirit god the holy spirit fills what was lacking fills what was empty your life is no longer going to be flat but it's going to be full of jesus and full of his spirit that when you give your life to christ you now have the holy spirit living inside of you and it starts to fill you with love fill you with peace fill you with patience gentleness faithfulness the holy spirit will help you start to have some self-control you become full of his spirit when you give your life to christ and the holy spirit is now leading and guiding you it's telling you where not to go and where you should go you now have the power of the holy spirit in your life to overcome any temptation any sin when we give our life to jesus he fills us up and makes us full of his spirit and being full of his spirit i'm telling you it's going to bless your life your future your family everything because here's what happens when you become full of the spirit of god listen you you are no longer flat but you're full you start living out the life that god created you to live and it was not to be dominated by sin but god created you a life to help you bounce over sin to help you overcome all sin he he wants you full of his spirit to help you overcome all challenges he wants you full of the holy spirit to help you overcome all of your struggles don't make me get steph curry up in here come on he fills you up so you can dribble around all the people in your life trying to mess with you and lead you the wrong way come on he's he's feeling you so you can make it through the narrow road and follow him and serve him and live the life you were created to live a full life of his spirit living inside of you jesus died he bounced back to life so that we could be full of life in the spirit real life new life life in the spirit and the number three jesus bounced back to life so you can have eternal life first john chapter 5 verse 11 and 12 it says and this is the testimony god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son whoever has the son has life whoever does not have the son of god does not have life through jesus christ we have new life real life life in the spirit and eternal life listen every single human being is going to live for eternity every one of us and those who make jesus lord of their life will have eternal life in heaven but those who refuse the love of christ they choose to have eternal death and god's heart is for everyone to have eternal life that's what easter is all about jesus died on the cross and he rose three days later he's alive again so you can be alive again jesus did everything he possibly could he gave his life so all your sins could be forgiven he gave his life so you could he could be a bridge to god he gave his all his holy spirit is chasing you and pursuing you his love and his presence and his mercy is saying come to me come to me give your heart give your life will you trust me he's doing all he can to save us all so that we can have eternal life with christ in heaven for all eternity and so today don't resist and refuse god's love john 5 40 it says yet you refuse to come to me to have life oh today don't refuse to come to jesus jesus bounce back to life so you can have eternal life life in the spirit real life and new life a brand new life come on that today you can be born again that today you can be made alive again check out these stories growing up i always felt the need to hide whatever i was struggling with trauma from past abuse left me searching for something to numb the pain in 2015 i was introduced to drugs i quickly sprouted into addiction every night i would smoke and drink until i blacked out i got to the point where just living was exhausting on the day before my 26th birthday i decided i didn't want to live another year i gathered narcotics and an entire bottle of vodka hoping to never wake up again instead i woke up to find the bottle unopened on my nightstand i could feel the holy spirit telling me your life is valuable to me i decided to come back to people's church i expected shame but instead i was welcomed with open arms i began to see myself as god sees me he changed my life completely and now i lead people in worshiping him every week i was hopeless now i'm alive again [Music] love the way you embrace broken people like [Music] love the way you won't forsake broken people like me when covet hit we decided to leave the church and everything kind of started to go downhill from there though i was sober for some time before the pandemic i did relapse from the medication i was taking the substances and the lying and the deceit i just turned my back on god and i was already depressed and then after our second born child things only got progressively worse and i remember like it was new year's eve and i cried out to god and i was like god i can't do this anymore once we started the church my healing was shortly thereafter first we got connected in growth track and i joined the first impressions team and then i started serving on the worship team and now we're living in more freedom than we ever thought was possible we were depressed and addicted now we're alive again i love the way you embrace broken people like me [Music] broken people like me [Music] i've always battled negative thoughts but going through a divorce made those voices louder than ever thoughts like you're not a good father you were never a good spouse you're a failure constantly ran through my head on january 13th 2021 i got in my car with my handgun and tried to take my own life but god had other plans and my son found me unconscious next to the shattered window i put what i've been going through on the people's church prayer app and i was blown away by the hundreds of people praying for me i got connected to the brotherhood men's group and sharing my story with other men made me realize i wasn't alone i'm now in school for ministry and pursuing the calling he placed on my life god took my shattered pieces and made something beautiful i was broken but now i'm alive again [Music] broken people like me [Music] broken people like me [Music] people like me [Music] my [Music] you found me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i don't [Music] my [Applause] [Music] was [Music] for me [Applause] [Music] [Music] of jesus [Music] it was nothing nothing but love [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] at 18 years old i was lost and i was looking for love in all the wrong places looking to alcohol looking to girls started looking to drugs and all those things all they did was they left me more and more empty and more and more hurting in summer of 1999 i sat in a church service just like this and i finally opened up i said god if you're real i want to know you and for the first time in my life i opened up my heart and i'll never forget just feeling the love and the presence and the mercy and the grace of god and it changed my life i gave my life to jesus that summer and he made me alive again he made me whole forgiven i found joy peace fulfillment i found the meaning of life and easter is all about how jesus he died but he rose he bounced back to life so that you and i can have life
anMguu0b6XE,well today we are continuing our series called bounce back and the title of my message is i'm tired of being fake i'm tired of being fake we've learned in this series we all have bad days it doesn't matter how much you love god pray read your bible you're gonna have a bad day we all have bad days because we live in a fallen world maybe this last week you had a bad day because maybe somebody cut you off maybe you hit a pothole and took you out maybe your bracket march madness bracket got busted and it turned into a bad day we all have bad days and when we respond the right way to a bad day we can bounce back but when we respond the wrong way to a bad day a bad day can turn into a bad week a bad month a bad year a bad decade or even a bad life and we've been learning some good advice from what jesus said on his worst day ever in a 12-hour period jesus experienced uh he had a really bad bad day he was beaten he was whipped he was betrayed he was humiliated he was rejected he was spat on he had to wear a crown of thorns and then he was nailed to the cross and on his worst day ever we see how jesus responded with seven powerful statements and from these statements we've already learned that on our worst day we need to forgive we need to remember our witness we need to love anyways and last week we learned that we need to trust god even when we feel abandoned and so today we're looking at statement number five read it with me in john chapter 19 verse 28 it said later knowing that everything had now been finished and so that scripture would be fulfilled jesus said i am thirsty when jesus said i am thirsty he was showing his humanity see jesus was a hundred percent man and 100 god not 50 50 he was 100 100. and because jesus was human when he was on that cross he was suffering he got thirsty he said i am thirsty it caused him to be vulnerable and transparent and ask for help even jesus admitted that he was thirsty so we realize that no one is so spiritual so self-sufficient so strong that they can make it through any bad day without any help but here's the truth it's not easy to be vulnerable and transparent and ask for help it goes against our flesh oftentimes we don't even want anybody to know we're having a bad day we don't want to ask for help a lot of times we'll hide the pain the struggle the bad day and this has been an issue from the very beginning all the way back with adam and eve adam and eve made a big mistake they sinned against god and their response to that very bad day gives us insight a picture as to why it's difficult for us today to be vulnerable let's read it together in genesis chapter 3 verse 7 through 10. it said then the eyes of both of them were open and they realized they were naked so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves then the man and his wife heard the sound of the lord god as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and they hid from the lord god among the trees of the garden but the lord god called to the man where are you he answered i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i had hid adam said i was afraid so i hid i was afraid so i didn't want to be exposed i had fear so i didn't want to be vulnerable and transparent i had fear so i didn't want to ask for help and when we have bad days our tendency is allow fear to control us and then we start hiding we hide from god because of shame we think there's no way god could love us we feel unworthy unloved we feel that god is mad at us and because of fear we end up hiding from the very people who could help us bounce back from a bad day proverbs 29 25 it says fearing people is a dangerous trap see on bad days so many people get caught in the dangerous trap of fearing people and they start hiding they're not transparent they don't open up they don't share what they're really going through men nobody can know that i'm hurting that i'm frustrated that i'm lonely that i'm tired that i'm confused nobody can know that i'm angry that i'm bitter and disappointed i have to hide and pretend that everything is okay and one of the reasons many people don't don't bounce back from bad days is because they pretend like they aren't having any see when we hide our bad days they turn into worst days when we hide our bad days they turn into worst days and one of the keys to bouncing back from bad days is learning to be vulnerable and transparent one of the best decisions you can make is do what jesus did ask for help jesus said i'm thirsty he was asking for help he's saying i need your help i want to give you three fears that keep us from asking for help three fears that keep us from being vulnerable and transparent the first is the fear of being hurt the fear of being hurt on bad days people fall into the dangerous trap of the fear of being hurt every one of us has been hurt in the past the reality is is you if you have ever loved someone if you have ever been in a relationship if you are married if you have children if you work a job or go to school if you're a boss or an employee you've been hurt we've all been hurt and you start thinking i don't want to get close to people because they might hurt me my pastor i think some people they go on the growth track and they think their spiritual gift is hurting people come on you know anybody like that like man would you think you would just put on this earth to hurt me and hurt people you got anybody you think they think like that's their purpose is just to hurt you and then you start feeling like everyone will hurt you so you start to feel man i can't be opened up i can't be real i might get hurt and you might be right there today but listen you can't stay there hiding never helps your life hiding will never lead to healing look at psalm chapter 32 verse 3-5 the psalmist said when i kept it all inside my bones turned to powder my words became day-long groans the pressure never let up all the juices of my life dried up then i let it all out i said i'll make a clean breast of my failures to god suddenly the pressure was gone see the enemy of your soul wants you to believe that everyone will hurt you so don't you dare open up don't you ask anyone for help you gotta keep it all to yourself and what happens when you do that is you start dying on the inside you hurt yourself when you hide your hurts and your hang-ups you hurt yourself when you deny your depression and despair you hurt yourself when you bury your bitterness and bad days it does way more damage to cover up your bad days than it does to open up and ask for help the psalmist said when i let it all out the pressure was gone when i let it all out something on the inside changed when i let it all out something shifted for their good i know for some of you opening up isn't easy because people have let you down leaders have let you down friends have let you down family has let you down a church lets you down but hear me your bad days turn into worse days if you hide hiding will not help you hiding will only hurt you covering up will only hurt you look what the bible says in james chapter 5 verse 16 it says therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of the righteous person is powerful and effective it can be incredibly hard to open up but your healing is in your revealing your healing is in your revealing if you keep hiding you're going to keep hurting but when you reveal that's where the healing comes i i remember when i was 18 years old and i was hiding from my parents and family i was drinking and started doing drugs and i was hiding it from everybody and all it did was lead to more pain and more hurt but i will never forget that church service where i decided to stop hiding and i started to start revealing i remember i pulled down that pastor he had no clue what in the world was happening he was lost but hey i just i confessed it all every last bit of it and as i revealed it healing began healing began i remember where a family member had offended me they didn't even realize that they had offended me but they did and i was angry and bitter and but i wanted to hide it and so i hid it and you know what all it did was it turned into more bitterness a bigger grudge i didn't want to be a matter of fact when i was around them i'd smile but i really wasn't happy with them you know what i mean i was putting on a show but i was really hiding and i had a lot of pain and i had a lot of anger and i had a lot of frustration and i had bitterness and i had grudges i didn't want to see them anymore i didn't want to be around them anymore and as long as i kept those feelings hidden you know what they did all they did was get worse and worse and worse and worse it wasn't until i called them up to lunch and sat down and decided to stop hiding see healing comes in revealing and i just shared with them my feelings and apologized and said i'm sorry and ask for their forgiveness and let me tell you when when when i revealed it listen the healing comes from the revealing proverbs 28 13 it says people who conceal their sins will not prosper but if they confess and turn from them they will receive mercy it can be hard to be vulnerable but your blessing is in your confessing let me give you the second fear that hinders people from being vulnerable transparent and asking for help it's the fear of rejection on bad days we can fall into the dangerous trap of the fear of rejection people don't open up because they don't want to be rejected rejection can come in many shapes and sizes there are different types of rejection that cause us to hide there's family rejection come on anybody been rejected by their family i know i have there's relationship rejection anybody ever been rejected by a spouse a boyfriend or a girlfriend i know i have there's social rejection anybody ever been rejected by a friend a co-worker a student at school or have a coach or teacher reject you i know i have i'll i'll never forget my senior year at bible college i went to a bible college and my senior year i became the senior class vice president and at my school they had chapel five days a week and on tuesday every tuesday it was senior chapel this is where seniors got an opportunity to preach to the entire school and the way that a senior got to preach for the entire school as they were selected by like a preaching committee and all my years the the the the three previous years i'd been at that bible college and all the years previous to my time being at that bible college the first three seniors to preach were always the sga president then the senior class president and then third was always the senior class vice president and so when the when the preaching committee came together and they revealed the first two weeks it was like it's always been sga president preached first senior class president preached second so they were coming out with who the next two names would be i'm just expecting that my name's gonna be up there i got a sermon it's in my heart i'm already writing it i'm ready to preach and the class president comes and say hey chris i'm man i'm sorry but um you didn't get picked and i'm like they they have the the treasurer and another person they're the next two up but i'm like okay i'm no big deal i don't need to be third you know what i mean it's cool yeah whenever they want to pick me and month after month went by this committee came together my name didn't come up i remember it was the last month and i remember the senior class president coming to me like chris i just met i don't know what's going on i put your name in there i just want you to know i'm pushing really hard this last one i don't understand it i don't know why they haven't had you preach yet but i'm i'm putting your name in there really hard last month and she came up the committee came out with the names and she said chris i'm so sorry you weren't picked y'all i believe i am the first and only senior class vice president to not preach at senior class chapel and that hurt man that rejection it stung it hurt it starts playing with your mind your emotions it'd be like am i not worthy like like what in the like why did i not get selected in rejection it hurts it hurts it it chips away at our ability to trust people again and so when we get rejected what do we do man we get like adam and eve well we start hiding because we don't want to feel that rejection again the bible says in genesis 3 7 it says then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realized they were naked so they sowed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves adam and eve before sin entered they were naked and they were unafraid there was no shame but as soon as sin entered the world oh they're covering up adam's like oh hey he was he didn't want to be rejected by eve he was like hey hey hey batman back up adam and they didn't want to be rejected and so they started hiding and they started covering up because you may not like me you might reject me and so they start hiding and hear me you'll never be healed when you're hiding healing comes from revealing let me give you the third fear and that is the fear of our image on bad days people fall into the dangerous trap of the fear of image the the image trap keeps so many people in hiding people aren't vulnerable because they fear others will look at them differently or look down on them or think less of them see being vulnerable and asking for help could cause me to lose my status even jesus status was mocked on the cross if you're the son of god come down off the cross if you're all powerful come off the cross if you're the son of god you shouldn't be thirsty have you ever heard these kind of statements real men don't cry big girls don't cry real men or women don't share their feelings a strong man or woman isn't vulnerable with people our family doesn't tell anyone our problems if you're a strong man or woman you can't show weakness you need to be tough don't let them see you sweat and the reality is we all have fig leave parts of our lives that we don't want people to see that we don't want anybody to know about that we wonder man if they knew what would they think if they really knew what was going on in my life what would they think and then you know what the enemy does when you're hiding he starts whispering in your ear oh yeah they'll leave you if they knew they won't respect you if you open up you better cover up or your reputation is going to be ruined if you share your problems because the enemy wants to keep you in hiding he wants to keep you in darkness that's his playground where he can continue to hurt you and hurt you over and over again because he knows healing comes from revealing but he wants to do all he can see fig leaves cover up our issues but they don't heal them they cover up our issues but they don't heal them people are working harder and harder at pretending instead of working harder and harder at getting better and the enemy he wants you to stay in hiding so that you'll never bounce back from your bad days and so how do we bounce back how do we come out of hiding to bounce back you got to do what jesus did you have to be vulnerable transparent and ask for help let me give you three ways to be vulnerable and transparent number one is this be vulnerable and transparent with god be vulnerable and transparent with god genesis chapter 3 verse 9 through 12. it says then the lord god called to the man where are you he replied i heard you walking in the garden so i hid i was afraid because i was naked god said who told you that you were naked who told you to hide who told you to cover up who told you to stop being vulnerable the lord god asked have you eaten from the tree whose fruit i commanded you not to eat the man replied it was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit and i ate it i want to point out a couple things here god says where are you listen when god asks you a question it's not for his sake it's for your sake it's for your sake and god's asking some of you this same question today where are you do you know where you are will you be real vulnerable and transparent adam was adam says i'm hiding i'm afraid i'm naked i was vulnerable today you need to be honest with god god i'm hiding i'm covering up i don't want anyone to know just be honest be vulnerable adam went on to say it's the woman you gave me oh snap and there we have the first marital conflict in the history of man can you imagine the look that eve gave him boy i bet her next snap so quick oh no you didn't she didn't have to say anything you know how woman can just give a look you're like she gave a look you know lost your mind but but adam was being real i'm not saying he was right he was being real with about his feelings man some of you just need to be real with god it's okay god i'm hiding because it's the man you gave me it's the woman you gave me god i'm hiding it's because those children you gave me it's the family you gave me the parents you gave me god i'm hiding because these friends it's those people at jobs school the the basketball team the ball team god i'm hiding it's these problems this depression listen be transparent with god your healing starts with revealing when you begin to reveal that's where the healing starts number two be vulnerable and transparent with some friends james 5 16 it says therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective there's two things i want you to see from this verse first is we all need some each others we all need some of each others nobody can heal all by themselves nobody can bounce back from bad days all by themselves and so scripture says you got to confess to each other so that you can heal your healing it happens from revealing there is blessing from confessing this the second thing is are each others need to be spiritual you want to confess to people that are spiritually mature that'll give you biblical counsel that'll take you to the word of god to help you you need some spiritual friends that will pray for you some of you aren't healing because you are confessing to the wrong people and the wrong people bring more hurt instead of healing so come on you got to find some godly some spiritually mature family friends that you can confess to my battle with anxiety i kept it hidden for many many years there were many nights in the middle of the night where i would wake up and i'd keep it hidden from jaime and i'd go into the living room and i would be having panic attacks for an hour or two hours or more and so finally i confessed finally i shared with jamie the the panic attacks i was having and i thank god for a wife that i could wake up at 1 am or 2 a.m and 3 a.m that would pray for me that would that would hold my hand i think hey she even spoke the truth in love sometimes chris you are not dying let's go back to sleep but i thank god she did it anyway right i thank god he won the wife he just turned on over and was like i'm just snoring away no no you got to have some godly family you got to have some some some small group friends man if you're not in a small group i would encourage you my small group uh this this last semester i remember one of the topics that we were just talking about being transparent and we were talking about being vulnerable and about insecurities about getting stuck in the comparison trap and it was a it was a liberating small group to be able to talk with other men about how we can get caught up comparing ourselves to others and feeling like we're not good enough or me and the gentleman i was talking to we were both talking about how we're both introverts and at times how the way our mind works and how we can feel like man just because we're not an extrovert that we're less than and all that stuff and i thank god for a small group where i could share and be open and and we can pray together and i could pray for them and i could pray for me so you got to get some small group friends and then get you some church friends man join the dream team the best way to make friends at church is through our dream team get alongside some other people that you can serve with you or give with your friend that you sit by at church listen here at people's church it's okay not to be okay all right we all have issues let me help liberate some of you okay the church is not a museum it is a hospital all right come on hey look at the person next to you look at the person at your right look at the person at your left they're looking good today aren't they oh they are look y'all are look at them right they are looking good today but guess what they got issues they are not perfect they got problems just like you do come on they they do not have it all together they need help just like you need help listen needing help isn't a sign of weakness it's a sign that you're human needing help isn't a sign of weakness it's a sign that you're human but the enemy he wants you to believe you're the only one so that you will stay hidden and hiding so that you can keep hurting so that bad days turn into worse days instead of you revealing so that you can find healing look what second corinthians chapter four verse two says it says we refuse to wear masks and play games rather we keep everything we do and say out in the open the whole truth on display so that those who want to can see listen today would you refuse to keep wearing the mask would you refuse to keep hiding behind fig leaves come on get you some friends and some godly friends and family getting a small group where you can be vulnerable and transparent your healing comes from revealing and then number three be vulnerable and transparent with some mentors some of the each others we need to confess to needs to be mentors you need friends but you also need some mentors to be transparent with mentors are people who are further along than you people who are wiser than you people who are more successful than you people who have a proven track record one of the best ways to bounce back and to grow in life is to get around people who are where you want to be listen if your marriage is struggling stop hiding enemy's just going to want to make you struggle more if your marriage is struggling go find some mentors go find some people whose marriages are thriving that you can learn from and you can grow from if you're dating life is a mess listen stop hiding most people can see you anyway come on would you stop hiding i won't you meet get come on get with somebody that their dating life is thriving get with some married folks that can help you get out of the dating mess that you were in listen if your children are out of control come on don't hide it call someone who is successful in their parenting if you're struggling financially come on don't hide it hang out with some people who have their finances in order and they can help you get your as long as you keep hiding it's gonna get worse but if you'll put it out there you can get some help if you're hurting because a loved one died or someone betrayed you come on stop hiding but get around someone that has successfully navigated death and betrayal if you're struggling in school your career and your business emotionally physically come on do not hide find a mentor that will help you bounce back i thank god for the mentors i had in my life listen financially jamie we used to hide like we had it all together but we were in a whole debt of mess and so i thank god that we finally said we're done hiding we're going to reveal it so we can be healed from it and we got with mentors like josh brown and my mom who are amazing with money and we're able to talk with them and they were able to help us get on the right track with our finances i thank god for pastor herbert i don't have to hide with him i can be real about my marriage and about my kids and about leading and being a pastor with my struggles and and my fears and i thank god he's where i want to be i can learn and i can grow from that relationship listen we all need mentors in our life because they can help us bounce back from bad days the enemy he wants to keep you hiding don't you let anybody know [Music] you better keep hiding he wants the fear of hurt rejection and your image to keep you in hiding so you'll never be healed and jesus showed us himself on the cross he said i am thirsty jesus showed us nothing wrong with pulling away the leaves and saying i need help that a matter of fact your healing will come from revealing your healing will come from asking for help

uh week three this week with us last week my family we did ours together and uh it it Sparks some really uh great conversations and you know one of the things that excites me about this spiritual journey is how you're going to learn so many spiritual lessons that you're going to be able to pass on to your children your grandchildren your Co co-workers your employees at your business to the students at your school and to your friends and family members and and today I'm going to teach you one of the key components to a spiritual journey that you have to possess so that you can step into the more that God has for your life and that's how to hear the voice of God let me show you how to hear the voice of God you need these ears if you don't have any of these sorry for you I'm just playing but how do you hear the voice of God some of youall have a hard time focusing with me wearing these but I'm going to wear them just for a little bit one of the biggest keys to winning in life and learning is learning how to communicate and communication has changed so much in our generation come on back in the day there wasn't near as much communication as there is today we didn't have cell phones we had corded telephones yeah come on how remember that cord how many of you had the extra extra long cord you you were wrapping that thing all the way around the kitchen the living room and the whole house and then all of a sudden we got cordless phones Oho shuy duy quack quack I got a cord I can walk around the whole house with my cordless phone today pretty much everybody has their own personal cell phone you can get emails on your cell phone I have like 53,000 emails in my inbox pray for me you get text messages we have emojis you have to learn how to interpret some of these emojis you know what I mean you're like what a what is that what is that mean a and it's really I'm going to take them off now this this a little too much there but hopefully you got a good picture it's really awkward when you get a text from somebody that you don't know especially if they act like they know you hey I was just just checking in how are you doing how is everything and you're trying to figure out who is this what do I say do I know you and a lot of times people's communication with God is very similar God is sending text messages from Heaven he's speaking to people and they're like who is this do I know you God is that you talking to me is that you speaking to me about the business deal is that you telling me to sell the house or by the house is that you telling me to get my kids to go to another school is that you telling me to date that person or to marry that person is that you telling me to take that job hello God is that is that you how do you know when it's God speaking to you and so today I'm going to share with you six lessons on hearing the voice of God number one is this realize God wants to speak to you John 10: 27 it says my sheep listen to my voice I know them and they follow me my sheep listen to my voice means that God speaks to his people God is a speaking God he's always speaking to his people throughout the scripture because he's a speaking God in Genesis 3 God spoke to Adam and Eve in Genesis 6:13 God spoke to Noah in Genesis 121 God spoke to Abraham in Genesis 262 God spoke to Isaac in Genesis 351 God spoke to Jacob in Isaiah 68 God spoke to Isaiah in the New Testament acts 10:13 God spoke to Peter acts 13:2 God spoke to the disciples acts 2311 God spoke to Paul we see a pattern in Scripture that God speaks to his people and God's people were able to hear his voice listen every follower of Jesus can hear God's voice see a lot of people think that God only speaks to really spiritual people or to pastors but God speaks to every Christ follower Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice not my pastors know my voice and that culture there were a lot of Shepherds and the Sheep would follow their Shepherd's voice and Jesus was saying the same way sheep recognized the shepherd's voice is how God wants us as his sheep to recognize his voice and I believe many of you want to follow the voice of God but you're not hearing his voice because you never obey what he says why would God keep keep speaking to you if you w ever do what he tells you if you're not hearing the voice of God go back to the last thing God told you to do and do it let me give you a tip on hearing the voice of God predetermine that when God speaks to you you're going to do whatever he tells you you to do this will help you stay connected to God's voice and then there are some of you you would say Pastor I don't really know how to discern God's voice there are so many voices coming at me I'm not sure which one is God I don't know if it's the devil's voice is it my flesh is it culture if if it's people or if it's God speaking to me how do I know number two eliminate the wrong voices we have so many decisions to make on a day to-day basis so we have to learn to eliminate all the wrong voices one thing I'm constantly doing is I'm eliminating all the voices I know that are not God because I've walked with God for a little while I know his character so I can quickly eliminate a lot of voices when you spend time with someone you get to know their nature their character and you start to recognize their voice after being married to Jamie Lee Smith for 20 years I know her we've had thousands of conversations lots of dates trips good days and bad days I've spent so much time with her I I know when she's happy sad angry or frustrated I know her character her wisdom and I know the decision she would make in a lot of situations because I've spent so much time with her what I'm saying is if you want to know the voice of God you have to spend time with God John 10:14 he says I am the Good Shepherd I know my sheep and my sheep know me when you spend time with God you get to know his character his ways his nature and it helps you eliminate a lot of the wrong voices because you know those voices don't align with who God is and so throughout this series I want your relationship with God to grow to know him and his voice better and so that's why I'm asking you to keep this guide with you and and read these daily devotionals I I want you to know God better so that you can hear his voice a big part of spending time with God and knowing his voice is also found in point three and that is God speaks through scripture one of the primary ways to get to know God his ways and his character is by reading the Bible and you have to read the Bible for yourself because it's a direct line to God the entire Bible is God breathed it's God in inspired 2 Timothy 3: 16 And1 17 it says all scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work see some of you are not being thoroughly equipped and you're struggling to hear the voice of God because you don't care consistently read the Bible and you won't be able to clearly discern the voice of God if you don't spend time in the word of God a a major key to Discerning God's voice is to read the Bible and do what it says and that's how you get to know the character of God the waves and the voice of God number four God speaks through trusted voices who know the Bible in scripture you see God using people to speak to his people there's also a spiritual gift called prophecy where God will use one of his people to speak a word from God to you now now the big thing I want you to understand is that God uses his people to speak to us and whenever a Christian gives us a word from God it will always be in alignment with the word of God the Bible and it will confirm what God is speaking to your heart if someone tells me God told me you're supposed to be single I'm like that's not God no that goes against God's word and the Covenant commitment of marriage if someone says me God told me you and Jamie supposed to have another baby the Devil is a Lie we took care of that y'all yeah I got a vect to me that we took care of that if someone tells me God you're or someone tells me God told me you're supposed to move to Asia that's not God God isn't speaking to me about moving to Asia but I've learned that one of the best things we can do for our spiritual development is to get some trusted voices in our life people who have a history of following God and obeying God people who know the Bible and live the Bible Proverbs 13:20 walk with the wise and become wise listen that's why being in a small group is so important want to encourage you Wednesday night come to Brotherhood Sisterhood family night we got dinner for you we got food we got youth for the kids the kid your children you can bring them put them back in the kids ministry listen you will never be able to discern the voice of God as clearly as you should all by yourself you need some trusted voices who know the Bible in your life number five God speaks through peace one of the ways that I discern the voice of God God is understanding that God leads through peace Colossians 3:15 it says Let the Peace of Christ rule in your hearts since as members of one body you were called to peace and be thankful whenever I'm trying to make a decision about my life my children my marriage the church I'm always listening for the Peace of God I know God is going to lead my heart with his peace you may ask well why here's why God speaks by Leading us not driving us he speaks by Leading us not driving us Romans 8:14 for those who are led by the spirit of God are the children of God God is a good shepherd and he doesn't drive us he leads us so I'm always listening for the holy spirit's voice to lead me with his peace when you read the Bible and you follow God for a little while you'll realize that God leading you through peace doesn't mean it won't require Faith following God's voice always requires Faith a great picture of this is told in in in in to Peter when Jesus told Peter to come and walk on water it was the voice of Jesus but it was still scary it was still dark outside Peter had never walked on water before it didn't make any sense at all but it was the voice of Jesus Peter he had to get out of the boat afraid following God's voice always requires Faith the Bible says in Hebrews 11:6 without faith it's imp possible to please God Romans 1:7 the just will live by faith following the peace of God and the voice of God always requires faith and following the voice of Jesus often times mean you will follow Jesus afraid the peace and leading of God doesn't mean you won't have to do it afraid Jamie and I have followed the voice of God afraid we followed the voice of God afraid when he asked us to leave Ohio and go be youth pastors at People's Church in Oklahoma City with our 5-month-old son to a place where we did not know anybody never been before and did not have any friends or family we followed the voice of God afraid about starting the first outof state People's Church campus we had never planted a church before it was scary obeying God it was scary when God spoke to us to empty our savings to give to another church plant before we planted our own church it was scary when God spoke to us to give on top of our tithe to give another 10% to the dreambuilder commitment to help provide the the the the AVL equipment for this room in this building when we first moved in over four years ago we did it all of this afraid and every every time God showed up and God showed out every time God showed up and he showed out and we're doing it again we're g to we're going to make the largest financial commitment we've ever made to the more spiritual journey campaign we're going to give the largest Miracle offering that we've ever given before in our life and as you're praying about your three-year commitment and your miracle offering that goes towards your three-year commitment you may have to follow Jesus afraid and all I want is I want you to hear the voice of God and do what God tells you to do you call People's Church your home just asking you to hear the voice of God and do what God ask you to do if you are a guest with us today we are not asking anything from you we are just so glad you're here and hope you see the man we are a church that is committed to seeing more changed lives over the years Jamie and I we've learned that there are three levels of giving as we listen for the voice of God the first is this what can I afford this level is what can I give without giving anything up there's very little faith at this level of giving and I believe God wants all of us to move beyond the what can I afford to give the second level is what can I sacrifice this level is what can I give only if I give something up it's logical giving I'm going to give up buying coffee or going out to eat or taking a smaller vacation or holding off on buying the new car or home or not retiring right now so that I can give to the Lord It's a logical sacrifice and then the third level is what can I trust God to do through me this level is what can I give if I give something up and then I trust God to be my source this is the faith level it's stepping out of the boat and trusting God to help you walk on water it's where you see the supernatural power of God show up in your life and God does more through you than you ever thought possible it's leaving room for God to show up Church let's all leave room for God to show up amen and then number six set aside set time aside to hear the voice of God John 10:27 says my sheep listen to my voice I know them and they follow me my sheep listen to my voice and they follow me it's important to take time to listen for the voice of God Jesus modeled this for us before Jesus selected the 12 disciples in Luke 6: 12 and 13 the Bible says he pulled away and he spent all night praying to God if Jesus needed to pull away from everyone to spend time with his father before making an important decision I think it's critical for us as well listen it will change your life if you will make it a practice to get alone with God and pray and listen for his voice before you make big decisions in life at this point in the spiritual journey here's what I'm asking you to do over the next two weeks before commitment Sunday on October 6th would you set aside some specific time to pray and to hear the voice of God would you get alone with God and ask him to speak to you so many people don't hear the voice of God because they don't make room in their schedule to hear his voice some of you you need to take off an afternoon from work and pray some of you you need to spend an entire Saturday with the television off and listen for the voice of God some of you you need to spend three or four evenings reading your Bible and praying for three to four hours if you're married spend time alone praying and then come together and share what God is speaking to you you'll probably have different numbers so go pray alone again and then come together and talk a second or third time it may take you a few hours over a few days to hear the voice of God and you may be thinking Pastor that's sounds crazy I can't give up that much time well the real question is how much do you really want to hear the voice of God I want to help you hear the voice of God I want you to be able to pass this on to your kids your grandkids your friends and your co-workers we are in everyone church and we want everyone praying and everyone hearing the voice of God we're asking everyone to be committed to four things number one everyone committed to attending three Sundays in a row September 29th through October 13th number two everyone committed to attending a small group September 22nd through October 31st number three everyone committed to making a three-year commitment on October 6th everyone tithing and then everyone making a three-year Financial commitment over and above your tithe to renovate our first permanent home number four everyone committed to giving to the miracle offering October 13th through December 31st everyone giving your best offering that goes towards your three-year commitment your best offering may be 10 20 30 40 50% of your three-year commitment and again if you're a guest please feel no obligation to make a commitment or to give but our church is doing this because we want to see more changed lives Jesus is changing lives at People's Church check out this video I would just find myself always in that space of am I good enough and you know that can lead get you to some dark dark places my lowest point I had just been dumped from a 4-year relationship I had a lot of debt I'm holding a 40 caliber pistol in my hands thinking that I'm ready to check out right before turning my phone off but my phone started to ring sure enough it was one of my teammates he's crying he don't know how much longer he could do it and I started to talk about God the little that I knew it felt like everything I was saying it's like God was sitting on the hood of my car you're here and you have purpose and you need to be here my friend Kayla and I began to date I felt a shift from sending me scriptures first thing in the morning and from there that turned into you know I'm moving to Oklahoma City okay well I want to see you she's told me I want my husband to be the the spiritual leader of our household so it's like hey what church are we visiting we visited People's Church Midwest City Mr Thomas greeted me as as soon as we came in and from introducing us to people in the church and making sure we had coffee like I get emotional now but I felt like I belong somewhere and I was welcome to be somewhere this is different this is different Pastor comes on the screen the first thing he's talking about is shame everything he hit on was everything I was feeling I got tired of holding on to all of that worry you know you're so much more than your worst day you're so much more than your worst second you're so much more than your worst thought I raised my hand for that alter call at the end with pastor and I just remember telling my wife like I think we found our church home I think this is this is where we want to go for sure and that turned into going every Sunday I was serving on the production team there were times I'd be on camera like holding the camera with tears running down my face I know he's wanting more and I need this public declaration so going in into the baptism and I went out into the lobby the signup sheet was there and I remember writing my name in getting into the water putting my feet in and and it was as though like weight was just falling off of me and I closed my eyes as tight as I could I just remember saying thank you [Music] God and coming out of the water and I felt like God has washed away my [Music] is and has given me an opportunity to be the man that he needs me to be in the man that I'm destined to become amen that's what it's all about it's always been and it always will be about more change lives that's why we're asking everyone to be committed to this journey because everyone matters to God there are andr in your life at work maybe in your home family neighbors they matter God loves them and God wants to reach them and so we want everyone committed everyone to hear the voice of God so that everyone can know God find Healing find Hope and find a home"

me up and I got 10 locks that I have to unlock in like 2 20 you know 20 minutes and and I don't can you even hold your breath 20 minutes is that even possible you know what I mean but you see them starting to get chained up and you you know you ever been there where you're watching it they're chained up they get put underneath the water how many of you hold your breath like I do is anybody like that I'm like holding my breath the whole time I'm like you know and you see him and so they get they get chained up here you're getting me chained up all right you got me chained up thank you would y'all please give it up for my wonderful assistant and so they get chained up they get put in the water and you see them wrestling and at first I think they're like doing it for show you know they're like but then the clock is ticking you know what I mean they're like and so no joke there was it was a Spain's Got Talent and I mean it started hitting two minutes three minutes and you couldn't tell like is he is he convolves it like what is happening and next thing he just started floating so they had to run and take him out he's like you're like brother you gonna regret that matter of fact he said I will never ever do this trick again he almost died like is this in a career class like is this what's happening in the high school and colleges now career class who wants to lock themselves up with the chain and get put underwater and potentially drown like is that listed on the careers like that should probably be like you are probably gonna have some regrets who in the world why in the world would you want to chain yourself up lock yourself up and almost die and yet one of the ways many people chained themselves up and throw away the key is through unforgiveness I've titled my message today I wish I would have forgiven sooner I wish I would have forgiven sooner I came across across this quote it says unforgiveness is choosing to stay trapped in a jail cell of bitterness or locked up chained up in bitterness and serving time for someone else's crime see unforgiveness will always be a pathway for regrets unforgiveness will always chain you up it will always weigh you down and when we have unforgiveness in our hearts we are chained up until we forgive and I know this from firsthand experience I'm going to confess to you today it is pretty easy for me to hold a grudge I can hold a grudge like Tom Brady he will never be the goat the dude deflated balls like no Pastor Chris you need to forgive me no no Bill Belichick he will never be the greatest coach he cheated he's a cheater and so I'm kind of joking but on a more serious note I remember in middle school I had a girlfriend you don't need girlfriends in Middle School just FYI I regret it but she broke up with me cheated on me I hated her I hated her the rest of Middle School I hated her all don't you look at me what you looking at I mean I had hate for this young lady for years because of what happened in Middle School I have two Pastor friends these are pastors supposed to be men of God character integrity they're supposed to be holy my friends and they betrayed me in the worst of ways and I don't want to forgive them I'm like you're Pat you're supposed to know better you're supposed to do better you were supposed to be my friend like I could and and then don't you dare do something to my family oh you want to get written off hurt my family I got a little Black List come on y'all like me oh I'll write you off with the quickness your name will be on that list and you will never be forgiven no I don't don't even talk anyone look at you I don't want to talk to you I'll be thinking all kinds of evil things about you and it's just really easy for me to hold a grudge to not want to forgive and I I found with people it's easy to justify unforgiveness let me give you some reasons why it's easy to justify unforgiveness first off there's some people they don't even want forgiveness they hurt you and you don't even care I ain't forgiven you are you kidding me no I will hate you the rest of my life sometimes it's easy to justify forgiveness because of the pain and I'm sure you're like me there are things done to me where I initially felt they don't deserve forgiveness the crime the pain they caused it was malicious it was unthinkable you were taking advantage of abused manipulated what they did was Pure Evil and if we're honest we want them to go to hell we may even have had the thought they deserve to go to hell they need to be punished some of us we justify unforgiveness because we just like to be angry I mean you ever met one of those people he's like they just want to be major about everything oh you're going to take the last cup of coffee like that yeah I see how yeah don't ever talk to me don't ever ask me for some money or a ride some of you right now you're like oh my goodness they sat in my seat at church I'm talking about having a people moment and you giving a glare to somebody let me find out your name do you know where you are I'm just playing we don't do that at People's Church we love everybody every seat is for everybody but I've been I've been to some places y'all excuse me here in my seat oh I didn't realize your name was on it my bad but we got some folks and it's easy to justify you're like hold up has done the Bible say ah for an eye you got to keep on reading you got to keep on reading and so there's a story in the Bible where the disciples had a question about forgiveness you gotta you got to put yourself in disciples shoes here are these men some of them were fishing they were doing other jobs one of them was a tax collector and Jesus like just come follow me and so they start following Jesus and they start hearing all kinds of crazy things and seeing all kinds of crazies I mean they're sitting there with them when he's saying love your enemies they're like what did he say he said he say love Aunt Gene no I mean he said enemies oh and then they see Jesus do it they see Jesus love the worst of the worst and just loving everybody and and he and they're like oh man but then they also see them rebuke some people the Pharisees yeah Jesus get them and so they're just watching they're seeing all this stuff I mean they're around when John the Baptist was beheaded like man do we forgive them have you headed our friend and so they're watching they're seeing all this I'm sure at times they that this question was just rising up they're like okay I got to get some clarity from Jesus and it came right after a moment where Jesus just said Hey listen if you ever see your brother or sister in sin man point out their fault and so Peter finally was like okay I gotta ask the question and it doesn't surprise me that it was Peter that asked it you know Peter was like okay I got to ask you Jesus so if somebody sins against me how many times do I forgive them like you know you he had to get some because if you know anything about Peter Peter I guarantee you Peter could hold a grudge you know what I mean Peter's the one that tried to chop a dude's head off when he tried to arrest Jesus thank God his aim was bad and all Jesus had to do was heal an ear you know what I mean but that's who Peter was and so Peter's like man listen look I got the fellas were wondering geez I just gotta ask Matthew 18 verse 21-22 which says then Peter came to Jesus and asked Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me up to seven times and Jesus answered I tell you not seven times but seventy seven times now here's what's interesting about this story Jews like Peter were taught that a man was to forgive another three times but not the fourth they kind of live by the three strikes you're out rule and so Peter was probably feeling pretty good he doubled it so Jesus I was taught three times and you're out but hey what about seven times I doubled it and I added one so he might have been feeling pretty that might have been what Peter was thinking he might have been feeling pretty good about saying hey suggesting seven times I bet it's pretty impressive to Jesus another thought that Peter could have had is that seven in the Bible it's it's a number of completion and so maybe Peter knew this and Peter was asking okay so they get seven because that's the number of completion and that means you don't get forgiven anymore sorry you don't ran out you used up your seven times it's the number of completion either way Jesus knew exactly what Peter was asking he knew exactly what Peter was thinking what is the limit how many times can somebody hurt me before I finally can say you're done I can finally write them off and Jesus said not seven times but 77 times and and basically what Jesus was telling them is that there is no limit see the use of the symbolic number seven that indicated completeness was obviously designed to lead the mind of the questioner altogether away from any specific numerical standard as such there is no such limit to the Forgiveness of God so there should be none to that of man and so matter of fact to drive his point home when he said 77 he was saying to them no you're not supposed to be counting out the times we keep on forgiving and the drive the point homie she shared a parable about how there was a a servant that owed his master this massive debt and and then and the master was getting ready to judge him for all that he owed but he begged and he pleaded and the master said okay I'll forgive all of your debts well that same servant had somebody that owed him and he grabbed that person and threw him up against the wall he's like man you owe me you better pay me and when the master found out about that he's like how in the world are you gonna go to that man talking about what he owes you when I just forgave you all your debts and what he was saying to his disciples listen when I die on that cross is to forgive everyone of all their debts and how in the world are you going to withhold something that's been given to you so freely he was letting them know listen that we forgive everything we forgive all debt and when you look throughout the Bible God's word is abundantly clear we need to be people of forgiveness not people who withhold forgiveness and I wish I would have known this sooner I wish I would have forgiven sooner I wish I would have known this sooner let me give you three reasons why I wish I would have forgiven sooner number one is this forgiveness set you free forgiveness sets you through free the the to withhold forgiveness keeps alive emotions of hurt and anger and blame which discolor your perception of life and it will leave you with so many regrets look what Ephesians chapter 4 verse 31 and 32 says it says get rid of all everybody say all it says get rid of all bitterness rage anger harsh words and slander as well as all types of evil Behavior instead be kind to each other tenderhearted and here it is forgiving one another just as God through Christ has forgiven you one of the number one ways that we hold on to bitterness one of the number one ways that we stay chained up by bitterness rage and anger and hate and harsh words and slander as well as all types of evil behavior is unforgiveness and God tells us we got to get rid of it all see forgiveness will break the chains of bitterness forgiveness will break the chains of rage and anger forgiveness breaks the chains of hate forgiveness sets us free from ruminating on negative feelings matter of fact forgiveness it sets your relationships free some of you in here today you have somebody maybe a loved one maybe family maybe a friend they wronged you but they've apologized they said I'm sorry but you won't forgive them and as long as you won't forgive them you think you're you got them in Chains the reality is is you have yourself in Chains you have that relationship in Chains and if you'll humble yourself if you'll forgive as Christ forgave you that that's the missing link that's the component that you need for that relationship to heal and be restored and again not I'll talk about this later not all relationships need to be healed and restored but there needs to be forgiveness and yet you have some if you would simply forgive the chains would fall off and there would be freedom and Reconciliation and it would help save that relationship see God gives us the key to Freedom is forgiveness forgiveness is the key he's given it to you you don't have to walk around in Chains of bitterness and anger and resentment you don't have to walk around and change of unforgiveness forgiveness leads to Freedom forgiveness is the key God gives us the key that we can be set free from unforgiveness number two is this so forgiveness gives you set you free in the number two forgiveness gives you peace see one thing when we don't forgive we won't have peace with God look at Matthew chapter 6 verse 14 and 15. it says for if you forgive other people when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive others their sins your father will not forgive your sins when it says your father will not forgive your sins if you don't forgive others it it isn't referring to your salvation okay because we're saved by grace not works there's nothing you can do to earn being saved we're Saved By Faith but what Jesus is saying is unforgiveness is a sin and that sin will hinder you and it will hold you back unforgiveness is a sin just like lying or murder or any other sin it's a sin that we need to repent of unforgiveness is not a sin that he will Overlook it's a sin that we need to ask for his forgiveness and then we need to change well repent means not that we just say I'm sorry but repent means that we change and we start forgiving others and so it's just like any other sin that we need to repent of and turn from because the sin of unforgiveness just like any other sin it's a sin that can draw us away from God it's a sin that can make our hearts hard and cause us to turn from God it's a sin that's hindering our relationship with God it's a sin that's blocking your blessing it's a sin that's blocking your freedom it's a sin that will block your breakthrough and it's a sin that is blocking your peace and God wants us to have peace but when we choose the sin of unforgiveness it's blocking us and it's hindering us from the peace that God wants us to have it's keeping us locked up and chained up and God didn't create you to be chained by anything and I think one reason people don't think forgiveness will give them peace is because they have the wrong perception of forgiveness and so I want to help you understand a few things that forgiveness is not number one forgiveness is not saying my hurts don't matter forgiving my offender doesn't minimize the seriousness of the offense against me number two forgiveness is not letting the offender get away with it if someone wrongs me he or she is answerable to God and he will deal with that person in the right way thirdly forgiveness is not forgetting only God has the capacity to forgive and forget we read about that in Jeremiah 31 34. however number four forgiveness is not a weapon forgiving someone doesn't give me the right to manipulate them at a later date by dredging up reminders of their forgiven offense so it's hard to forget but we don't need to keep a record of wrongs there's a difference between remembering so that you can protect yourself and a difference between keeping a record or wrong so you can keep hanging it over somebody's head and beating them over the head with their offense over and over again as long as you keep a record of wrongs you will not have peace as long as you keep a record of wrongs you will be chained up forgiveness is not a weapon number five forgiveness is not reconciliation I can forgive but I might never be brought into a right relationship with the person who has wronged me because he or she might not be willing to cooperate and so I've forgiven some people and we have a great relationship there are others that have done damage and hurt to me or my they would be a threat to me or my family and so I have forgiven them but I will not be friends with them I won't be inviting them over to the house I'm not getting coffee with them I'm not getting close to them I've forgiven them and I've prayed for them but that relationship will never be reconciled and that's okay forgiveness is not reconciliation and then number six forgiveness is not easy I'm not here to tell you it's easy it's heavy these chains are heavy I've carried these chains I felt the heaviness I've experienced the lack of peace I've been in bondage to unforgiveness and I'll be honest with you listen I can't do it on my own and I haven't done it on my own we need God's spirit to see me through Matthew 5 38-39 Jesus said you have heard that it is said I for I and tooth for tooth and some of you are like preach it and then Jesus says in verse 39 but I tell you do not resist an evil person if anyone slaps you on the right cheek turn to them the other cheek also notice it into say slap them back it's a turn the cheek walk away that's not easy it's not easy but I promise you that when you forgive you'll experience peace and here's the thing you won't experience it until you do it I know right now you're feeling the hurt the pain the wounds I know even as I preach for some of you the memory it is real the wounds are deep and you're thinking how in the world can I have peace after what so and so did to me and all I can tell you is you won't experience it until you do it you won't experience it until you forgive but I can relate to that pain but I can also tell you the moment I got with Jesus and I had to wrestle it down and it was a wrestle it was not easy I had to talk it out I had to pray it out I had to process it out I had to tell God some things I wanted to do to that person because I couldn't tell that to nobody else and I needed God to calm me down and talk me down and reason with me and I had to wrestle with it some more but I can tell you when you do it peace will come and guess what when you do it peace will come but it can come back those chains can try to come back some of you are like but I did forgive but then I done a week later I started feeling the same anger and bitterness and I felt the chains coming back on me it's not working no it is it's a process you got to forgive again that's why Jesus said seven you keep forgiving until the forgiveness is complete you keep forgiving until the forgiveness is plead he has given us the key but it is a process it is a journey you may have to forgive over and over again you may have to forgive for weeks maybe months it may go away and then 10 years it may come back and you know what you do you forgive again you forgive again because forgiveness is the key to peace keep on forgiving forgiveness it sets us free it gives us peace and then number three forgiveness makes me more like Christ Colossians 3 13. it says bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone forgive as the Lord forgave you I believe forgiveness is one of the most christ-like things we can do and Jesus didn't just talk about it he did it Luke 23 34. nailed to a cross suffocating grasping for breath bleeding crown of thorns on his head he found enough strength to muster these words father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they divided up his clothes by casting lots see Jesus didn't just teach forgive 77 times he lived it and he lived it in front of everyone and he forgave the very people that wronged him that spit on him that slapped him that ripped out his beard that whipped him that put a crown of thorns on his head that nailed him to the cross and crucified him he forgave the very people that were mocking and laughing at him gambling for his clothes on the ground right before him while he is suffering to catch his breath he forgave Jesus is our standard not the world it's Jesus he's our example he didn't just teach us to keep on forgiving he showed it was what to forgive and who to forgive and how we should forgive and listen I'm telling you I've been there I've felt the pain I've literally had to have moments where I felt like I was sitting next to Jesus and I'm complaining and I'm but Jesus they did this this and that you know what Jesus did he just listened you just listen but God and I'm telling him and I'm angry and I'm mad and I'm hurt and then when I'm all done I said what do you want me to do Jesus [Music] Chris you know what I want you to do I want you to forgive oh but I can't I can't he listens and he loves he says you can I'll help you you know what you need to do you can search my word high and low and you're not going to find another answer you're not going to find another solution you're not gonna find anything else to set you free from these chains but to forgive [Music] and it wasn't easy it still isn't easy but I have peace I'm better I'm stronger with Christ's help I've been able to forgive people I thought I could never forgive I've been able to pray for people I thought I could never prayed for and I'm telling you he gives us the key it's right there you don't have to walk around carrying the weight and the chain no matter what's been done to you listen God can set you free Jesus said I forgave you now listen how can I withhold from someone else what God wouldn't would hold for me forgive as Christ forgave you how can I withhold forgiveness when every day he forgives me every day I fall short every day I mess up I've made so many mistakes and he's forgiven me every time how can I withhold that from anybody else [Music] so today if you're chained up with unforgiveness you have the key Jesus and he's here and he said listen I made a way you don't have to carry those chains this forgiveness is more about you [Music] is about them I've given you the key [Music] forgive [Music] today we can unlock the chains today you can be free if you'll forgive you don't have to leave this place chained up anymore you can leave here free
U2GRC_P4siM,and today we are continuing our series called I wish I would have this series is all about having less regrets fewer regrets in 2023 and the title of my message today is I wish I would have prayed more and worried less I wish I would have prayed more and worried Less in 2011 I started having some pain in my side my abdominal area and I wasn't sure what it was I was taking Tylenol started taking some peptos started taking some gas eggs I mean I was just taking it all like what in the world is going on and the pain wasn't going away and so I finally uh went to my family physician and don't you love how the doctors push on the areas where the pain is like I don't need you to push for me to let you know that's where it hurts it hurts right there but he's pushing on things and I'm like yeah right there it hurts and so he's pushing he's feeling around he's not quite sure he's like you know let's take some blood work and you know we'll we'll see if we can find something and so I think it was a a day or two later I get a phone call from him and he's like you know what I would like you to come in and uh let's let's do a CAT scan and so um I you know they give you the juice you gotta drink the juice and you got to wait about two hours and then they go and scan you and so they scan me and I get done with the scan and um I'm getting ready to leave the doctor's office in my phone is ringing and it's my doctor and I'm like hello he's like yeah hey we we just got the results and uh you you have an appendicitis and uh it's close to bursting so I already uh have a you scheduled to go over to the surgery center just drive across the street to the surgery center we have a room waiting for you just tell them uh your Christmas and they will get you over there and we'll get you into surgery as soon as possible you know what I mean so everybody's talking on the phone I'm trying to play cool okay yeah so yeah so we're gonna go over to the surgery center and okay cool but as soon as I hung up I'm like ah David I'm gonna die who's going up I'm calling her I'm like David and I gotta appendicitis in my birth right now she's like what do you want me I'm like you need to come to the hospital I might die I might never see you again like you need to come and so y'all I am freaking out if you don't know much about me I can be a little bit of a hypochondriac I'm like is this thing gonna explode right now it's a little head gonna you know just pop out of there so I'm like oh my goodness so I get over to the surgery center as quickly as I possibly can I'm like I'm Chris Smith they said they got a room for me okay hold on a second let me check let you check this thing is about to burst they said y'all was waiting on me it'll be okay just hold on I'm like and so my anxiety is is just going off the charts uh matter of fact when they finally get me to the room when when Jamie gets there she can just see it all over me I'm white as a ghost and she can tell I'm just freaking out she's like Chris let's go die I love you let me hug you let me hug Jason and so the doctor came in and uh he could tell as well like my wife was like yes he has he's having pretty bad anxiety right now and and I can't even remember how we gonna become to find out that uh my surgeon he was a Christian and he said Chris it's going to be okay I believe God has put you in my hands and we'll take care of it can I pray for you yes please so the surgeon prayed for me and then when he got done when Jamie came she brought our son Jace he was four at this time and after surgeon left Jace came up to me he said Dad it's going to be okay let me pray for you so you know you gotta you gotta man up a little bit when your four-year-old is like coming to pray for you you know what I mean but so again my my son prayed for me the doctor prayed for me and you know here I am I'm in trouble I'm my appendix is about to uh burst matter of fact when the doctor he told me later after the surgery said it was so close to rupturing that he went ahead and put a little bag over it before he removed it just in case uh it it did rupture but I was in trouble y'all I was in trouble I was in trouble in my physical body and I was definitely in trouble mentally and emotionally as I'm worrying and having a panic attack and I'm freaking out and yet God gave me a Christian surgeon to pray for me he gave my four-year-old to pray for me and my wife to pray with me with this physical problem and emotional problem I was in a bad spot but because of who I knew I had an unfair Advantage so they say it is in what you know it is who you know and might I suggest to you today that who you know is bigger than any problem you may face because you because who you know is the god of the universe he is large and in charge he is bigger than your struggle he is bigger than your obstacle he is bigger than your delays and setbacks and he is bigger than your failures and mistakes and he is available to you in prayer you have an unfair advantage today and prayer unlocks that unfair Advantage When you pray God makes a way and prayer at its simplest is honest communication with God and I understand prayer can be confusing even the disciples had some confusion about Prayer in Luke 5 the disciples said Lord teach us how to pray and so there's no shame in being confused about prayer and Jesus said so he taught them he says when you pray say it like this Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 and 10 Our Father in heaven Hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven this prayer is known as The Lord's Prayer but it really should be called the disciples prayer because it was meant for you and me and it's a prayer that you might have heard and even recited yourself and the prayer begins with the words our father this would have shocked anyone listening to this in Jesus day because up till now when you approached God it was all about his Holiness his holy otherness so imagine the surprise when Jesus says this is how you pray and he kicks It Off With Our Father which in Aramaic would have been the word Abba think back to the first word your child spoke by All rights it should be Mama right and all the moms said amen but how many of you moms were like Jamie no matter how hard you try you spent hours [Music] and that baby just looked at you and said dada no mama mama that baby look back to you dada I'm sorry moms actually I'm not sorry I kind of feel kind of good that my kids first words word dad dab but listen it has nothing to do with one parent being more special or anything like that not at all Linguistics linguists will tell you it's easier for babies to say Dada than Mama it's easier for them to say dada and it was the author and theologian Brendan Manning who pointed out that in Jesus's culture a baby's first word was Abba it's the most simple and familiar word they have for father Jesus was the first religious leader who ever addressed God in this way and he taught us to do the same so when you come to God In Prayer the first thing you need to know is you cannot do it wrong you cannot offend him you cannot be too personal you don't have to have it all together you will never be a bother because he is your Abba your dad your father and you are his child his pride and joy and he literally gave his life to give you access he went to the Cross so that you could come to him prayer unlocks your unfair advantage and my hope is that in 2023 you will make a commitment to pray more and worry less pray more and worry less and so how does prayer unlock your unfair Advantage number one is this prayer positions you for provision prayer positions you for provision my son Jace is now 15 years old and last summer he got a job and I remember when he got his first paycheck I said Jace come here let's let's sound let's sit down I need to talk to you about a few things he said yeah Dad I said now that you have a job and you're getting a paycheck I need you to pay rent I need you to pitch in for the groceries here is your phone bill I need you to pitch in on the internet the cable the water the heat the gas all the elected utilities and you need to go ahead and buy your own clothes so glad you have a job I'm just playing I didn't I didn't say that to my son but we did talk about some things that he'll need to be responsible for and the truth is I love providing for my kids it's my joy to be in a season or even Jace when he has a job I can say you know what you don't have to worry about bills you will someday hopefully you'll have your own money your own space and all I ask is you have a nice big basement so me and your mother can come live in it since we spend all our money to provide for you and your siblings you know sometimes I wonder if God feels the same way about us he wants to provide he wants to help he wants to be our source and he loves to be asked look at what Jesus says Matthew 6 11 he teaches us to pray give us this day our daily bread bread is a picture of all the things you need daily to make it God knows you need to eat he knows you need a home he knows you need Transportation he knows you need human interaction he knows that you need meaningful work he knows that you need Freedom he knows that you need to grow he knows that you need strength and he knows that you need love and I believe he Delights in providing all the things you need to become all that he desires you to be but part of that process is asking for his help and it helps you realize you are not alone and you don't have to carry it all on your shoulders see prayer is how you partner with God to provide and as a pastor I've encountered several myths when it comes to prayer and so I want to go over these with you the first myth is this and that myth is prayer is for professionals it never fails I can be in a room full of Christians I can be in a room with people that have been saved longer than I've been alive but when it's time to pray they all look to me like pastors the only one that can pray you can pray you go ahead you can pray too but it's a myth that prayer is for personals or some people with words that you need to use or patterns you need to follow listen those things can be helpful but at the end of the day prayer is just having a conversation with god it's open to anyone anytime anywhere and like every new thing you try you know when you first do it it may feel a little weird it may feel a little uncomfortable but it will feel more natural the more that you practice it and in fact Jesus denounces big showy prayers that are just done to impress others he stresses honesty intimacy vulnerability transparency like a person hiding themselves in a closet no one else can see or hear it's a it's a no judgment Zone let me give you the second myth the second myth is that prayer needs to be significant people think you can't just pray for anything it needs to reach a certain level before you bring it to the god of the universe and when you do do it needs to be long and difficult and repetitive and I just I love the story in second Kings chapter six the prophet Elisha was with some men and he represents God and God's voice to the people and the men were going off to chop some wood they needed to chop down some trees and asked Elijah to go with them and he went and as they're chopping down the trees one of the men's the ax head on his ax it flew off and it went into the river and it sunk and the man said Elijah my ax had and I'm sure there were some other men like man don't be bothering Elijah wouldn't brother just go to the Home Depot back in Jerusalem man like it's just a it's just an ax head like I mean come on man you asked a profit for something let's let's ask him to chop down the trees so we don't gotta keep chopping and and and so his ax head went in he said pray he called out to the Prophet Elijah and he said where'd it go where did it fall he said over there he said okay take a stick throw it there and he threw it and the stick hit the water where it went and then the ax had floated to the top of the river and the man was able to grab it what an incredible display of how nothing is insignificant to God that God cares about every aspect of your life even in ax head that might have gotten that might have fallen off into the river it seems so in a such an insignificant thing to expend Divine energy on but that's the point God is so big that no request is too small matter of fact the meaning of Elisha's name is God is our Salvation God is in the saving business if it's big enough to worry about it's big enough to pray about and when you think your prayer is ridiculous hey you just remember that ax head listen I pray big bold prayers I'm asking God for miracles and breakthroughs but you better believe I've also asked God to help me find my keys hell I've asked God to help me find a remote I've asked God Lord can you make all those lights green so I don't miss this meeting you hey I once saw Jamie call down fire from heaven she she got battery acid on her favorite pair of jeans oh she pleaded blood the blood of Jesus over those genes that they would not be ruined they were her favorite pair and you know what God answered her prayer so listen nothing nothing is insignificant all right the truth is Jesus would rather you pray often he wants to hear about everything talk to him about everything nothing is in significant in the moment you think your prayer is ridiculous remember the ax said let me give you the third myth and that's prayer doesn't produce some people have prayed hard for something but it didn't go down like they wanted I know I've been there but the Bible never tells us prayers are like the Oprah show you know I mean you get a car and you get a car and you get your answer prayer everybody's prayer is just getting answered you no no no no no God is still God his ways are higher than our ways matter of fact the night before Jesus was crucified he prayed he asked God to shut it down he asked God to make this cut pass but then he added but not my will but yours be done see prayer is not just about asking it's about trusting let me say that again prayer is not just about asking it's about trusting one way or the other God will give you what you need he may give you an answer or he may just give you peace he might remove a problem or he might just remove your fear open doors or as much an answer to prayer as doors that remain shut and the promise is not to give you what you want but to always give you himself and so the answer to this myth is pray humbly trust God no matter what prayer is as much trusting as it is asking and that no matter if the doors are closed you trust him and you keep following him you thank him for the closed door as much as you thank him for the open door because he sees what's on the other side and he knows and he's protecting you you trust his timing you trust his heart when you cannot Trace his hand prayer it positions you for provision and then number two prayer positions you for power I was listening to a devotion this week and it reminded me of God's saving power it said he didn't wait for your best to love you or to give his life for you he loved you and died for you at your worst when I was lost broken looking for love in all the wrong places looking for Acceptance in all the wrong places looking for joy and purpose in all the wrong places when I was lying to everyone including myself God rescued me he helped me he saved me I was I was started attending a local church and he used people in that church to help disciple me and and and restore me come on think back of all God has done in your life how he saw you through difficult days and worked in your life when you saw no way how he was faithful to you when it seemed like everything was falling apart he's still available he's still faithful he's powerful to save anyone and do anything and so Jesus continues to lay out a model for prayer he goes on to say we should not only ask for provision but we should also ask for power Matthew 6 13. it says and do not lead us into temptation but Deliver Us from the evil one did you know that the Bible says that Jesus was tempted in every way that we are but never sin that means he can relate he knows what you are going through and he knows how to get you through what you are going through and the Bible says that God is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but he will provide a way out so you can endure often we hear people extrapolate from this verse and say God will never give you more than you can handle that's not exactly what it says he will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear I think we all deal with more than we can handle all the time sin is more than we can handle pain can be more than we can handle the hurt can be more than we can handle his calling is more than we can handle God does the work we can't and sends us the strength we need but the Bible does say that God won't allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear but will provide a way out God is your deliverer not just once and done God can deliver you from whatever is trying to destroy you he can give you a way out Psalm 50 15 God says call upon me in the day of trouble and I will deliver you and you will honor me that's why I'm a big believer in SOS prayers you know what I mean when you're seeing that hot now button flashing at Krispy Kreme or you're close to a Long's bakery God help me when a god Cuts you off on the freeway and you want to wave at him without all your fingers God help me you look at home prices rental prices and you just want to give up and lose hope God help me come on you spend all kinds of time and money preparing a meal for your kids and they say I'm not hungry and then an hour later they're asking for a snack God help me or your spouse shares a problem she's dealing with and even though she just wants you to listen everything in you wants to solve the problem but you know that will create a new problem God help me over time listen these SOS prayers they're going to lead to helping you getting stronger and help you avoid these situations you're going to build up new habits and patterns that keep you from those traps so prayer positions you for power and then number three prayer positions you for freedom prayer positions you from Freedom how many know that God's his grace his forgiveness his hope we didn't deserve it you know what I mean you're been given something you didn't deserve maybe some praise that you did not deserve I know my my greatest athletic achievement in high school was one that I did not deserve and it wasn't it was in a basketball game it wasn't for my school team I was not good enough to make the school team but me and my friends we started talking about where who's better which neighborhood has better basketball players and I I lived off of 46 in post and we were like oh yeah 46 in post we have the best basketball players well I have some friends from Castleton that were like no no no no Castleton has the best basketball players no they don't and so oh we were talking some heavy trash at lunch that day about who has the best basketball players they said we got to settle this and so we set up a game five on five and so after school that day we left Lawrence North High School and we went down the street to Castle View Baptist Church they had a nice basketball court and we did a five on five game and I was on the team from 46 and post and it was it was uh uh first to ten win by two playing ones and twos and it was a close tight game it was eight to eight and my team had the ball and I found myself in the corner behind the three-point line and for whatever reason I can't even remember why my guy left me and I was wide open and one of my teammates saw me wide open and he he passed me the ball and I caught it and I shot it and Bam swish went in we won the game the team ran over and we all jumped we were like yeah 46 in post what now what now some of the other teams like man you don't leave the white dude open for the three what were you thinking and we had bragging rights listen y'all I was the least athletic person on that court I was definitely the slowest on that court I never played for any of my school teams because I was not good enough I wasn't even the first I wish I could tell you I had the ball I crossed somebody over and dotted their eye you know what I mean the fade away I wish I could tell you I was bad you know just writing somebody's face like Kobe no no no they just left me wide open I just happened to be open I didn't deserve to be open I made the shot it's the only shot I made and everybody celebrated like I was just this great I was not anything special I did not deserve it and in our lives through faith in Jesus we learned that we receive forgiveness Grace and hope and we didn't deserve it we didn't deserve it and it is out of his great forgiveness and Grace that we are empowered to forgive others and Jesus places forgiveness in his prayer saying it's a daily thing we need to address look at Matthew chapter 6 verse 12 and verses 14 and 15. it says and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors for if you forgive men they're trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses a couple weeks ago February 19th I preached the whole message on forgiveness and if you missed it I would encourage you to go watch it it's called I wish I would have forgiven sooner so I'm not going to spend a lot of time here but it's so important to realize that forgiveness is about your own freedom it doesn't mean the hurt didn't happen or did it matter it doesn't mean that you need to let the person back in your life it doesn't mean you need to instantly feel better or that it's once it's a Once and done thing listen no one ever found real healing themselves by hurting others and Jesus is serious about forgiveness because he is serious about your freedom and so in our prayer he teaches us when we pray we need to forgive others and we may feel like they don't deserve it and neither did we and God still forgave us you know need to forgive as he forgave us and then Jesus ends his model prayer with a powerful statement about God he says in Matthew 6 13 for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen that's a statement about the authority the authority of the one you have access to so I thought it might be powerful to end today reminding us all of the one we know and who knows us the one Jesus told us to call Abba when you read through the Bible you see descriptions and teachings like this of who God is that God is the one who laid the foundations of the earth and brought order out of the chaos while the Angels shouted for Joy he told the Raging Waters to be still and the oceans this far and no further will you come he commanded the morning to appear enrobing the world in light and color he maintains the storehouses of snow and makes the rain to fall and directs the movement of the Stars he is the source of wisdom the Wellspring of goodness the Arbiter of justice and the author of life he is all-knowing all present all-powerful and all-loving nothing stops him nothing confounds him nothing scares him and nothing is beyond his reach his protection is permanent his faithfulness is unfathomable his patience is impenetrable and his compassion is incomparable his Mercy never runs dry his favor never fails he owns the cattle on a thousand hills and the Earth shakes at the sound of his voice enemies fall faint at his sight his strong right hand his name is Holy his will is history his plans are your future his presence is our joy for he is the one who is worthy he is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever this is who God is this is who you have access to this is the one that you can pray to and call out to he is the one that gives us the unfair advantage and so my hope after you hear this message is that in 2023 you make a commitment to pray more worry less pray more worry less invite him to act intervene guide and to rescue because prayer positions us for his provision his power and his freedom pray more worry less
Oo77PFOdWTE,well today we are continuing our series called winning everybody say winning the title of my message today is think like a winner think like a winner our theme verse is first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24. the bible says don't you realize that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize so run to win god created you to run to win but so many people are running to lose so many people are running just to get by so many people are running just to make it no no god created you to run to win and so in this series i want to teach you how to run and win in your life you can win and last week we looked at the life of gideon and if you remember that if you remember the story of gideon gideon felt like he was losing he was hiding from the eminianites matter of fact when when when the angel came on the scene it was like you're a mighty warrior he was like who no man i'm a nobody i'm the least of my tribe i am the weakest and the angel said no no no no you are a mighty warrior see to be a winner in life you have to believe what god says about you you have to believe what god says about you and in order to do that winning it starts in our mind it doesn't start in your relationships winning doesn't start with your bank account it doesn't start with your degree it doesn't start with your connections connections winning starts in the mind the bible says in proverbs 23 verse 7 for as he thinks in his heart so is he what you think is who you are if you think you're a loser you're gonna live like a loser if you think you're a failure you're gonna live like a failure if you think you're defeated you're going to live defeated if you think you'll always be addicted you're going to live addicted if you if you think that things will never turn around in your life or situation it won't turn around if you think you can't win you won't win you are what you think you are where you are today because of what you thought yesterday and you will be where you are tomorrow because of what you think today winning starts in the mind your thoughts determine the direction of your life your thoughts determine the quality of your life your thoughts determine the success of your life you are what you think and the problem is most people think that what they think doesn't matter that what they most people don't think what they think really matters hosea chapter four verse six the bible says my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge because you have rejected knowledge i also reject you as my priests because you have ignored the law of your god i also will ignore your children people are destroyed because of their lack of knowledge and not only do people lack knowledge they reject knowledge they think how they think is okay oh my thinking is great if somebody disagrees with my thinking they're wrong i'm right they're wrong i mean i mean if someone sees something different than me they're wrong i'm not changing my thinking because my thinking is fine matter of fact how i think isn't that big of a deal anyways i mean who cares what i'm thinking about it's not a big deal and people don't think what they think really matters they do not think it's a big deal and many have become very careless with their thought life and reminds me of this boxing match i saw check out this video where the sam maxwell was really going to be a champion in the making sadiri has perhaps shown that there is still a long way to go and he almost went there he almost went with that left hand [Applause] [Music] really joking wrong we should be jumping all over it i don't know why he's uh well one punch there and he'd have been down surely he thinks he's so far ahead i think that's what it is and he might be but sadiri certainly believes he's won the fights he's winning this wrong that's for sure and maxwell looking a little bit groggy and a face switch tells a good story left hand right hand from maxwell well where did that come from i can hardly believe what i've seen an astonishing turnaround he gets to his feet and he stopped it he stopped it sam maxwell turns that fight around and where oh where did that come from oh that brother thought he was good you know i got this i ain't got nothing to worry about i got you beat oh what  knocked slick out he got careless and he got reckless and he lost and many people are treating their thought life like this brother was treating that fight they're getting careless with their thought life reckless with their thoughts and people are getting beat up in their life because they're getting beat up in their thoughts their career is getting beat up mental health is getting beat up finances are getting beat up relationships are getting beat up faith is getting beat up folks are getting knocked out because they don't think their thought life is really a big deal it's not that important it doesn't matter what i think listen what you think matters and i want to teach you how to think like a winner i want to give you four strategies to thinking like a winner four strategies to thinking like a winner number one is this you must identify the first strategies you must identify unhealthy thought patterns see people are destroyed because of their lack of knowledge they're getting beat up by their unhealthy thoughts and they don't even recognize it they're like this boxer they're shadow boxing they think they're good and they don't even realize their unhealthy thinking is putting them in a position to get punched over and over again that it's putting them in a position to get knocked out that's what happens with unhealthy thinking and people don't even realize their thinking's unhealthy and they're taking punch after punch and they don't even see them coming and so i want to help you identify some unhealthy thought patterns that are beating up your life i want to help you identify some unhealthy thought patterns that can knock you out the first is this is doubting thoughts look at james chapter 1 verse 6 through 8 look what the bible says about doubt it says but when you ask you must believe and not doubt because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind that person should not expect to receive anything from the lord a doubting person such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do let me talk to you about a doubting mind see a doubting mind is constantly doubting the promises of god it does not trust god or his promises it knows god's promises but it does not trust god's promises it knows what god says but it doesn't trust what god says it's always doubting the bible and god's promises a doubting mind it's unstable and confused confused in their thoughts confused about life confused in their convictions confused about god's word one day they believe god's word but the next day they read an article on the internet or they come across something on social media and they no longer believe god's word they're unstable always being tossed here and there by their life because of doubting thoughts a doubting mind is always living in a state of compromise this person has divided loyalties half of them lives for god while half of them lives for sin they're always torn in two directions they have a relationship with christ and a relationship with some sinful obsession a relationship with god and a relationship with the world they're they're double minded see a doubting person is always diluting their faith in christ christ is not enough for them they want jesus and astrology jesus and new age beliefs jesus and good works jesus and you you fill out the break a person that that is dominated by a doubting mind jesus is never enough and so you have to identify doubting thoughts or they will keep beating up your life and your faith number two is anxious and worried thoughts anxious and worried thoughts anxious and worried thoughts they will hit you over and over and over and over again until they knock you out and you have to identify anxious and worried thoughts so that they don't knock you out philippians 4 6 it says don't be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your request to god don't be anxious about anything because anxious thoughts will beat you up and i know this because i have been beat down by anxious thoughts in my life i have had anxious thoughts punch me in the face over and over and over again i've had times where i can't sleep i'm losing sleep i'm edgy i have tightness in my chest having panic attacks because of these anxious thoughts that are attacking me i've had multiple times where i've had to go to the hospital because i thought i was having a heart attack but i wasn't the problem was is i had these anxious thoughts these unhealthy thoughts that were beating me down anxious thoughts they will beat up your life and so we gotta we have to identify them now number three the third uh unhealthy thought we have to identify is critical thoughts see critical thoughts can be so hard to identify because we live in a critical society i mean everybody is critical of one another people hop on social media with the quickness and they will criticize everything and every body and our culture it celebrates this it it celebrates having a critical spirits but listen critical thoughts they will beat up your life the pharisees struggled with critical thoughts in matthew nine verse three through four it's a story where jesus forgives this man of his sins and look what happens it says at this some of the teachers of the law said to themselves this fellow is blaspheming knowing their thoughts jesus said why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts i just forgave that there should be a celebration there should be a party and there you are over there criticizing me for forgiving a man see these teachers had a critical spirit there's a significant difference between helping someone improve and having a critical spirit a critical spirit is always disappointed always finds the bad wherever they look always finds the negative you know you you just cannot please a critic i mean it's too hot it's too cold traffic is always bad their job is you don't even want to ask them how work was do you know what i mean like you can be like man i heard you just got a raw but let me just not a good enough raise i mean my goodness if they really paid me what i was worth and what i've been doing and you're like oh jesus they don't like any of their friends they don't like the winter spring fall or summer i mean i just come on how do you know somebody with a critical spirit come on in how many of you sit next to somebody but oh don't raise your hand don't raise your hand don't don't they're gonna be criticizing you i can't believe you raised your hand and you embedded me church a critical spirit will always beat up your life nobody wants to be around somebody with a critical spirit because they're negative bitter angry nitpicky always in someone else's business joyce meyer says a negative mind cannot lead to a positive life and so you got to identify critical thoughts let me give you the fourth unhealthy thought and that's sinful thoughts sinful thoughts roman 8 6 it says so letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death a sinful mind will beat up your life it says by letting the spirit control your mind leads to life and peace a sinful mind is dominated with thinking about sin addictions lust the affair getting drunk partying stealing from someone getting even hurting someone so we got to identify sinful thoughts or they will beat you up and then the fifth unhealthy thought is selfish thoughts look what the bible says about selfishness in james 3 16. it says for wherever it says for where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice let me ask you are your thoughts always consumed with yourself are consumed with what you want what makes you happy it's about me me me i i and here's the struggle most selfish people can't identify their selfish thinking they can't see that selfishness it is beating up their life their relationship their career and their future and so we have to ask god we have to ask the holy spirit we cannot ignore we got to identify unhealthy thought patterns that's the first strategy and then secondly what we have to do is we have to capture unhealthy thoughts capture unhealthy thoughts look at second corinthians chapter 10 verse 5. the bible says we demolish arguments in every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god and we take captive every thought and make it obedient to christ once you identify the unhealthy thoughts that are beating up your life you have to take those thoughts captive when a a criminal tries to rob a store and he's running the the police say they go to catch him they got to take him captive to take him captive means you stop him you stop him from running you stop him from doing crime to take our thoughts captive we got to stop our thoughts we got to grab them and stop them from running around in our mind 24 hours a day we got to say no i'm not going gonna keep doubting the promises of god i will not have a doubting mind i'm gonna take those doubting thoughts captive in jesus name i'm not letting doubt run through my mind when you start feeling anxious and worried you got to take those thoughts captive you can't let anxious thoughts and worrisome thoughts run through your mind don't let your mind keep going to the worst case scenario don't just sit there the next hour and worry in the hour after that and the hour after that don't just lay in the bed at night and just keeping anxious thoughts you got to take those thoughts captive when you have critical thoughts about people when you want to say something mean and hurtful to someone stop stop the thought take it captive when you want to go off on somebody on social media give them a piece of your mind no no no you got to take that thought captive you got to stop that thought when you're having negative thoughts about your day your life people or your future you got to take those thoughts captive don't meditate on those critical thoughts when you have sinful and tempting thoughts you got to take them captive listen no matter how much we pray how close we get to god we all have sinful and tempting thoughts the key is to take those thoughts captive don't let your mind run wild with sinful thoughts you've got to take them captive you have to take selfish thoughts captive when you find yourself only thinking about yourself take it captain when you're caught up in your feelings and thinking you always got to have it your way it's all about me myself and i you got to take those thoughts captive if we're going to have a winning thought life you have to take unhealthy thoughts captive you cannot allow them to keep running wild in your mind the third strategy is this you gotta so we gotta identify have to take unhealthy thoughts captive and then number three we have to renew unhealthy thoughts renew unhealthy thoughts look at romans chapter 12 verse 2. the bible says do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what god's will is his good pleasing and perfect will this is huge church your life is transformed by the renewing of your mind if you don't change your thinking you won't change your life if you don't have a renewed mind you won't have a renewed life you have to decide that you are not going to continue to conform to the patterns of this world the unhealthy thoughts of this world you're not going to live like everybody else lives you're going to be different you're going to be a person that lives by the bible and you have to let god's word renew your mind see god's word will wash your mind just like water and soap washes your body and so you got to let god's word wash your mind by reading it so some of you you need to shower your mind with god's word most people take a shower once a day some twice a day for 10 to 15 minutes and to have a renewed mind you have to shower your mind in god's word daily come on every day take that shower shower your mind with god's word for 10 to 15 minutes some of you you need to soak your mind in god's word your mind is so unhealthy a shower will not get it done you you gotta soak it my daughter callie she loves to take baths if we are not careful she will be in that bath for over an hour we'll be like where is cali at y'all she is still in the bath water cold and everything i mean we we gotta she loves to soak in the bath and some of you you need to soak your mind in god's word once or twice a day for 10 to 15 minutes isn't enough you need to spend 30 minutes an hour of your day in god's word soak your mind in god's word so you can so god can renew your mind and then some of you you need to power wash your mind in god's word i thought about bringing a power washer up here but it might get a it might get a little wet in here but your mind is so unhealthy you need to power wash it one of our pastors his name is pastor rob he shared his testimony of just how his mind got in such a bad place his thinking was so unhealthy he was so low he was so depressed that he just started listening to god's word all day matter of fact he had a job where people could listen to music or whatever while they're working he just had the word of god playing in his ears all day long when he drove he was listening to god's word he was just he was power washing his mind with god's word to help him have victory and freedom over the challenges that he was facing listen some of you you need to be in god's word constantly so that you can get your mind renewed that's why you don't miss sunday you need to hear the teaching of god's word start off your week every sunday hear the teaching of god's word every sunday in god's house that's why you need to get in a small group where you can study god's word and talk about god's word we're going to be launching those in in less than a month matter of fact we need some of you to lead small groups around god's word and bible study so that people can get their mind washed with the word of god you got to read the bible all the time get the bible app get the the you can listen get bible on audio you can get get a book get if you if you're like no i don't like audio and technology i mean just go buy you a book but get get get the bible get a hardback paperback listen give the word of god so that you can have it listen to it in your car listen to it in the morning just get god's word in your mind power wash your mind with god's word that's how we renew unhealthy thoughts and then number four the fourth strategy is you have to set your thinking on healthy thoughts set your thinking on healthy thoughts roman 85 says this it says those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires to change your unhealthy thinking you have to set your mind on godly things second corinthians 10 5 it talks about how you got to take every thought captive and it goes on to say make it obedient to christ that means we have to set our mind on christ we have to set our mind on the word of god you have to set it come on everybody say said it colossians 3 2 it says set your minds on the things above not on earthly things you have to set your mind on godly things listen our brain is a muscle matter of fact our brain i would say is the most powerful muscle in our body and you can train your brain you trained your brain in elementary school in middle school and high school and for some college you trained your brain how to use a computer you trained your brain how to play different sports or play an instrument or sing a tune you trained your brain to work on a computer you train come on some of you remember today when you were just like this but now you're like i know some of you are still like this but that's okay you trained your brain to lose voice to text you're like i'm just going to talk it all on there but now the way you you trained your brain you trained your brain to use a smartphone my three-year-old knows how to i mean it just blows my but he he's trey knows how to use it we we can train our brain to do all sorts of things and listen you can train your brain to be set on godly things and not earthly things and so we got to set our mind winning starts with setting your mind it can be trained on godly instead of earthly but you have to set it after i got saved i was 18 years old after i got saved god was just working on my heart and i felt like i needed to just stop listening to secular music and so i got rid of all my secular music i i stopped watching r-rated movies because i wanted to set my mind on him those things were not having a good impact on my mind and i wanted to set my mind on godly things not on earthly things last year i had all the news apps i was getting breaking news here there all these notifications it just wasn't good for my thought life and so i erased those apps i want to keep my mind set on godly and or godly things i don't need to know everything i i can know some things but i don't need to know everything there are times in life even recently right to stop watching certain shows because they were affecting my thought life in a negative way during 21 days of prayer and fasting i'm fasting social media i'm getting my mind set on christ focused on christ i need the mind of christ i need his word on my mind to renew my thoughts and get set on him and his ways winning starts with setting your mind so let me ask you this question what do you need to do to set your mind so you can win in life philippians 4 8 says finally brothers and sisters whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things listen don't set your mind on earthly and worldly things set your mind on godly things you may be thinking why pastor what's the big deal because what you think is who you are what you think today determines your tomorrow and if you think worldly you live worldly if you think you're going to lose you're going to live like you're losing what you think today will determine your tomorrow you start thinking godly things you're gonna start living a godly life you start thinking with faith you're gonna start living with faith you start thinking of what is pure you're gonna be able to live what is pure you start thinking about forgiveness you're gonna be able to live out forgiveness what you think today determines your tomorrow and god wants to renew our mind so we're not following the patterns of this world but so that we are setting our mind on the things of heaven and godly things but you think today determines your tomorrow
GsB3i4d0jaQ,well today we're continuing our series I wish I would have and this series is all about less regrets in 2023 and 2023 we want to have fewer and less regrets and so we're diving into man I wish I would have it's going to give us a foundation for this year to live our life according to God's word and his will so that we're thriving and flourishing and having more freedom and fewer regrets and the title of my message today is this I wish I would have put God first I wish I would have put God first there was a Super Bowl game where a die-hard fan came to his seat and was surprised to see that there was an empty seat in the stadium the man on the other side of that seat said oh it was my wife's but she died he said oh I am so sorry to hear that yet I'm really surprised that another relative or friend didn't jump at the chance to to take the seat reserved for her the man said beats me they all insisted on going to her funeral that ain't right right there it is I think that that brother's priorities might be a uh he's like she ain't coming back now I'm going to the Super Bowl a week listen in our world we can become so focused on ourselves and being me first that we lose sight of what's most important in life we love to put ourselves first we want to be first string on the team we want to be first chair in the band first place in the race first place in the the board game or the the card game come on how many I'll just get vicious and nasty with board games like you are you are going to be first people will get up early on Black Friday in the cold and put out a tent to be the first in the store my kids race to be first in the car dropping elbows on each other we race people in our cars to be first to the light and come on you ever see that person maybe it's you at the grocery store and you trying to get first to that line you know what I mean like like you can't run but you got to do that fast walk you know but we know what you're doing trying to be first we love to put ourselves in first place and we think our lives will be better if we are first but Jesus steps on the scene two thousand years ago and says if you really want to be first place in life if you really want to win in life if you really want a blessed life it doesn't happen by putting you first it happens only by putting God first Matthew 6 33 Jesus said seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you the greatest regrets of your life of my life have happened because we sought after the wrong things what we sought after didn't deliver the results we thought it would and instead it delivered pain heartache broken relationships and regret after regret see what you seek will determine what you get and the outcome is predictable all of us are seeking after something and our seeking is leading us in a direction and the outcome is predictable some of you are seeking for love in all the wrong places and the outcome is predictable pain heartache broken relationships regret after regret some of you your whole life is seeking after more and more money more and more possessions and the outcome is predictable pain heartache broken relationships regret after regret some of you your goal in life is to seek as much pleasure as you can find and doing whatever makes you happy and the outcome is predictable pain heartache broken relationships regret after regret and Jesus said hey hey Christ followers I don't want you to live a life of regret so don't live like those who don't know God don't put you first look at Matthew 6 32 Jesus said for the Gentiles the the pagans they seek after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them all see those who don't know God seek after the money the car the thrill the pleasure the power the popularity first and it ends with pain heartache broken relationships regret after regret Jesus said I know you need the money I know you need the clothes and the possessions I know you need the relationships but I also know you don't want to live a life full of regrets so seek my kingdom and my righteousness first and then everything else will be given to you all those other desires you will have will be given to you but you must put God first not you first so I want to share with you today three truths I wish I would have known about putting God first I wish I would have known these when I became a Christ follower I wish years and years ago these three truths I would have known about putting God first number one is this I wish I would have known that everything is more spiritual than you realize everything is more spiritual than you realize before Jesus said seek first God's kingdom and his righteousness he was talking to people who were worrying about everything in life they were seeking the wrong things in life and Jesus was teaching them how the spiritual and the natural are connected most people don't understand this they ignore this verse because it doesn't make sense to them if I need a car or a home a relationship a business deal I'm gonna do whatever I need to do to get it but what does Jesus mean seek God first I got to make this happen and so people try to make dating happen on their own they try to make marriage work on their own they're trying to make parenting money and career happen on their own they're trying to make important life decisions on their own and they don't realize that the natural and spiritual are connected everything is more spiritual than you realize seek the kingdom of God first and God will provide everything else because the natural and the spiritual are connected everything is more spiritual than you realize everything Ephesians 6 12 it says for our struggle you name the struggle it is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the Heavenly Realms our struggle is not against people we're not wrestling and fighting against people it's more spiritual than you realize your marriage struggle is more spiritual than you realize your struggle with your child is more spiritual than you realize the financial struggle is more spiritual than you realize the struggle at work at school in your dating in your health in your friendship is more spiritual than you realize you are in a spiritual battle the Bible says in First Peter 5 8 be alert and of sober mind we got to be aware we got to be sensitive your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour you're in a spiritual battle there is a real devil and if I was the devil I wouldn't want you to know that I was involved in a lot of things that you're blaming on people I would want you to keep thinking it's your boss it's just your spouse it's just your parents or child it's just a money or health problem no no no no no no everything is more spiritual than you realize and so what do we do what do we do second Corinthians chapter 10 verse three through four it says for though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does we live in the world but if we're going to win the battles of life if you're going to live a life with fewer Regrets We can't do things like the world does them we can't fight the way the world fights verse 4 it says the weapons we fight with are not weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds Paul says don't view your life and your problems the way the world does it's more spiritual than you realize don't fight like the world does you got to use spiritual weapons seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness see God first through prayer and fasting and worship see God first through gen generosity in Bible reading and righteous living and loving people and making God honoring decisions and then God will add all those other things to your life I wish I would have known everything is more spiritual than I realize number two I wish I would have known that it would be my best year ever if it was my best year spiritually Jesus said seek me first and all these other things will be added to you in 2023 but here's what people think it will be my best year ever if I can get the home the car the dream job the relationship friendship my marriage fixed and so people spend all their time seeking after those things instead of doing what Jesus said and that seeking God's kingdom if you put his kingdom first everything else will fall into place but you have to seek his kingdom over your kingdom you have to seek his way over your way you have to seek his will over your will you have to seek to follow what he wants over what you want in high school I I played a little football I was I was not very good I got a late start I was on uh I think JV as a junior and but anyway I was playing football and I remember getting to practice and they put me on the offensive line and they put me in at guard and they put me in a a run play where I had to pull okay to to block if you're not familiar what what a pull is is let's say this is the center and on the guard when they say hike I come around behind the center and I'm coming up through a hole to block a Defender so that the the running back our running back he's like 250 pounds Steve Taylor he was a monster would just come barreling through and and run for a touchdown so that was the play and that's why I remember being excited like oh man I get to pull you know because normally you're just blocking to the right or left or in front of you but I'm like okay I'm about to take somebody out here oh yeah I'm about to pull and so I remember I was getting down I was excited and they said Hut then I turned to pull and boom got knocked flat on my back by the running back I did not pull fast enough I was pulling way too slow there Smith get out of there they never let me back in and do he knocked me clean out see when you don't run the right play oh you will get knocked out by a 250 running back that's trying to get to the end zone like get out of my way what are you doing but in college I played a little bit of football it wasn't a lot but a little bit it was one game a year it was against the Rival Bible College in town okay so I'm not even not even that special but nonetheless let me have my moment so in college uh they had me as a tight end and and primarily a blocking tight end and uh the the the game was coming up and we had another uh stud running back don't worry they didn't have me pull once praise the Lord but we had another stud running back we pretty much we had like hardly any pass plays it was just because and and the other team we just knew they weren't going to really be able to stop our run and so uh so we were practicing all of our plays learning the plays they had one play just in case just in case if they were just you know focusing on the run too much it was a play action where me as the tight end I I would go and run just like a quick out like two yards uh to to catch the ball and so they had that one pass play so we get to the game probably aren't even going to run it but we're running the whole game I mean I don't think we passed one time first quarter second quarter third running and we're scoring and we're running uh and and when we're dominating um but fourth quarter comes and they they call the play action uh play the play action passed to me I'm like oh snap I might get to catch the ball whole game we've been running and it's the same run but instead of you know a play action is instead of them handing it off to the running back the quarterback fakes it keeps it and then makes a pass and so I'm I'm there as the tight end and so they say hi so I sell it I start I start blocking but then I release and I and I go for to to do this little uh to get open and the quarterback does the fake handoff and he comes back around and y'all I'm just like wide open like I didn't do like a cool catch catching it running y'all was like a mama it was like come here and they throw it to me and I just catch it right I catch it and they were so faked out there was nobody near me oh oh snap I start running y'all I'm running I get to the sideline order chase me they're a little fast little dude coming after me bam stiff arm I ran it was a two-yard reception but a 27-yard touchdown score listen All Because listen when you run the right play You're Gonna score touchdowns when you run the ride play you might be like oh my goodness I am wide open and I caught this past and there is nobody around me run foreign I want you to run God's spiritual play and watch God work powerfully in your life and so I'm gonna give you a spiritual play today I want you to run this play for one year and I'm telling you God is going to move in your life in a mighty way and it will be your best year ever if you will run the play run the spiritual Play here's the first part of the play Faithfully pray and read God's word Faithfully pray and read God's word give God the first 15 minutes of your day pray worship Bible five minutes of prayer five minutes of worship five minutes of Bible listen the more you read the Bible the more you'll love the author and you don't read the Bible to know the Bible you read the Bible to know God and a Dusty Bible always leads to a messy life so every day pray worship Bible pray worship Bible attend 21 days of prayer right now it's not too late this last week jump in come to the six to seven a.m prayer service Saturday 9 to 10 a.m fast and pray in August we do 21 days of prayer be a part of that listen Dirty Knees will keep you from a dirty life we got to pray pray and listen I'm telling you even right now in these last seven days join us God is listen God is doing Miracles at People's Church we actually got a video of a testimony of a miracle God did during 21 days of prayer check this out during prayer and fasting while I was at church on Friday the 13th I went into prayer for others and healing for their body and I said oh yeah let me also pray for my shoulder touch my shoulder Holy Spirit said touch your shoulder touch my shoulder didn't heal I kept walking kept I said but I am healed kept walking kept praying then during corporate prayer he started praying and I lifted my arm wait a minute lifted my arm wait a minute could you not could you not lift it before I could not lift it without pain before wait a minute I can lift my arm let me see if I can rope I can rotate my arm with no pain no pain at all wow how long has your shoulder have pain so long I don't even remember wow come on y'all listen God is a god of Miracle signs and wonders I'm telling you when you press fast and pray God moves in a mighty mighty way would you jump in this week and join us let's pray let's fast god is moving in a mighty mighty way so the first part of that prayer of the of that play is Faithfully pray and read God's word number two is this Worship in God's house Faithfully worshiping God's house Faithfully Psalm 84 10 it says better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God in the Church of my God then dwell in the tents of the wicked better is one day in God's house than a thousand elsewhere I'd rather be in God's courts more than any basketball court I'd rather be in God's Court more than any other great food court nothing can compare to being in God's house with God's people I love God's house I love Sundays I love our morning prayer time I love his presence I love being with y'all and worshiping and getting closer to God and hearing from God better is one day in his courts than a thousand elsewhere and if you don't have a passion to be in God's house ask God to put a passion in you for his house and his presence David said in Psalm 69 9 passion for your house has consumed me pray God give me a passion for your house God give me a passion for your presence God give me a passion to worship with your people God give me a passion to be in your house and hear the preaching of your word better is one day in his courts in his house than a thousand elsewhere listen set a goal come on set a goal of how many Sundays you're going to be there's 52 Sundays be in God's house 48 or 45 of those Sundays set a goal for how many Wednesdays your students are going to be at Epic student Ministries and and we got the four-week challenge that's coming up sign up take that four-week challenge let that catapult you to have a passion and be in God's house every single week number three number three third part of the play is give your life away Way by serving others Faithfully give your life away by serving others Faithfully listen complete growth track if you have not been through growth track growth track is designed to help you discover your purpose and to discover your spiritual gifts you take a spiritual gifts assessment and you can see what gifts God has given you and the gifts that God wants to use growth track is the number one way to serve on the Dream Team come on in 2023 if you are not on the Dream Team join the Dream Team some of you you were serving before the pandemic and you're no longer on the Dream Team everything is more spiritual than you realize you may think oh well listen man I'm telling you right now if the enemy can stop you from serving and using your gifts for the Lord in the local church he will do it you want to you know what God's Secret Sauce is is you you know how we reach more people it's you you know how we see more changed lives more people come to Christ you're his secret sauce he wants to use you to impact his world and so some of you you've been distracted even you didn't even realize it but it's more spiritual than you realize listen would you get back on the Dream Team today some of you have gone through growth track but for whatever reason haven't got listen get on the Dream Team today you all know where to find me I'm in the hallway find one of our staff say Pastor I need to get back on today I need to run the play in 2023 and for those of you like me I don't even know how to get on a Dream Team I've never served before that's why we have growth track go through growth track and we'll help you get on the Dream Team I believe every person in this room here has a gift that God wants to use at People's Church to see many many more people save there's still a million people in our city that don't go to church that need Jesus how are we going to reach more of them you it's you you don't believe me look at First Peter 4 10 it says each of you should choose to use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms you are his secret sauce he wants to use you to smile to wave to love on a child to Mentor Youth to be behind the scenes whatever it is he wants to use you and then number four fourth part of the play is grow closer to God and others by attending a small group Faithfully spiritual growth happens best in circles not in rows spiritual growth happens best in community not in isolation you will never reach your god-given potential on your own and so either lead a small group or would you join a small group in 2023 would you run the spiritual play we're going to put it on the screen I want you to take a picture of it I want you to make a commitment I'm telling you right now this the one year for one year run the spiritual play play Faithfully pray and read God's word Worship in God's Health Faithfully give your life away by serving others Faithfully grow closer to God and others by attending a small group Faithfully if you will run the play I'm telling you you will have your best year ever because it will be your best year spiritually and then number three number three I wish I would have went all in with Jesus sooner going all in is how we seek first the kingdom of God wants to be first he wants you all in not half in not three-fourths sin anybody remember the Hokey Pokey I remember the Hokey Pokey you know what I mean you put your foot in you put your foot out you put your foot in and you shake it all about you do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around that's what it's all about oh yeah y'all remember it yeah yeah some of you have Hokey Pokey face like I put my kids in oh but I'm putting my marriage out I'm putting my Sunday morning in oh but I'm putting my Friday night out well I'm gonna put my attitude in imma put my money out I'm gonna put my friendship in I'm putting my anger out I put my car in but I'm putting my job out I put my friendship in but I put that and that's what it's all about Hokey Pokey face we'll leave you with so many regrets it will have you wishing you would have went all in with God sooner see some of you have not gone all in with God because you deceived yourself with Hokey Pokey faith God's not first in your life and you think it's okay because God's apart of your life I believe in God I believe the Bible I come to church sometimes I pray sometimes I'm not all in but but God has some of my life but listen God doesn't want you half in and half out he doesn't want to be a part of your life he wants to be first in your life God won't settle for a second place in your life look at Luke 9 chapter chapter 9 verse 61 and 62. it said another said yes Lord I will follow you but first let me say goodbye to my family Hokey Pokey Faith always says but yeah God I'll follow you but first what's your butt first instead of God first what's your butt first instead of God first what's your excuse what's that area of your life that you've refused to put God first in it says but Jesus told them Anyone who puts a hand to the plow and then looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God I love how the message says it in verse 62 Jesus said no procrastination no backward looks you can't put God's Kingdom off till tomorrow Seize the Day come on in 2023 let's stop doing the Hokey Pokey no more Hokey Pokey faith I'm gonna put this in and keep that out in 2023 let's go all in for Jesus I'm telling you right now you will have your best year ever if you have your best year spiritually if you will run the spiritual play every week every every day I'm telling you you're going to be scoring touchdowns for Jesus you're not going to be getting knocked over but let's run the play Let's be all in with Jesus
kLmNpb6bFvA,"I want to share some exciting news with you today I know you've been waiting for it some of you remember in November at our annual Vision night we call it one night I preached a message called Don't box God in Pastor Herbert and I we really felt like the Lord imp pressed this on our hearts for 2024 don't box God in and I want to give you a little history on our People's Church Indie campus we started our church in 2015 we were leasing out Fall Creek Valley Middle School we met there for about 4 years we were portable church at the middle school and then four and a half years ago we moved into this building that you're sitting in right now and we are currently leasing 30,000 square fet of this building the entire building is 58,000 square ft and over the last two or three years we have been looking for a building to purchase and the door has closed on every building we've pursued we've been looking at church buildings Standalone stores strip malls y Jericho marched some buildings I laid hands on buildings the Bible said knock and the door will be open people looking at me weird I'm knocking on buildings like we have just we've been looking and yet each time the door has been closed even this year we thought we had an incredible opportunity to buy a building and the door closed again 13 weeks ago the owner of this building that we're leasing contacted us and said he wanted to sell us the entire 58,000 sqt building him and one of his relatives they own the building together his relative had a business in the part of the building that we're not Leasing and the relative passed away and the the owner doesn't want to own the building by himself and so when the owner first contacted us about selling the building we weren't interested because we were pursuing another building because we have a great relationship with the owner shortly after the deal fell through on the the building we were pursuing the owner let us know that he had a contract in hand and he just wanted to double check to ensure that we weren't interested and we remembered what God spoke to us in November don't box God in Pastor Herbert would you please come and share the rest of the story come on would y'all give it up for our pastor as he comes to the stage I get to share the rest of the story how you doing Indianapolis everybody doing good so good to see you and I do want to share uh the rest of the story so we began conver ation with the owner and as we just continued to talk uh myself Pastor Chris Pastor Josh our board of directors we just knew God was up to something and the owner told us that he would sell us the 58,000 foot building the 5.19 acres for 3.2 million and if you are like me when it comes to math I got to get a calculator to figure all this stuff out but that is $55 a square foot we did a comp study of the area because we always do due diligence so we did a comp study of the area and buildings are selling for 75 to $80 a square foot and we thought don't box God in and and then we started talking to our lending institution and they told us that if we bought the building our building payment would be right around the same payment as we're currently currently paying to lease the building and we thought well don't box God in and then we also found out that 7200 square feet of the building is leased out for nine years to a company and the contract is written in a favorable way for the new owner so the company is actually leasing out 7200 square fet for $6,600 a month and at the end of the 9-year contract they'll be paying $8,100 a month so we would generate monthly revenue from this company which would lower our building payment don't box God in as we were doing our due diligence we also discovered that the city is putting in a nice walking trail right next to the property where the train track is located how many of you ever heard about nickelplate Trail that's going to come in that's going to increase the property value and the trail will be completed in 2025 and we thought don't box God in and so we can buy the building for under market value have a cheaper payment then we're paying the leas the building and here's the great news for our Indianapolis campus is that we can expand the auditorium now and add a lot more seats and expand the kids area expand the lobby so that we can reach more people for Jesus come on can we thank the Lord for that so our our Indianapolis campus has close to a thousand people attending on Sundays in our three services and purchasing this 58,000 foot building will now allow us to expand the auditorium kids space Lobby where we can now double and possibly more than double our attendance and our impact so we thought don't box God in so we presented this to our board of directors and they said God is up to some something with this and the board of directors approved for us to purchase the building and the 5.19 Acres so here's what I've come from Oklahoma to announce to you today we and the owner just signed a contract on this building for us to purchase the building and we close on the building on June 17th don't box God in and I got on the airplane cuz I had to be here to tell you this news Look What the Lord Has Done and I want to report to our Indianapolis campus that over the last couple of years and I really commend you for this you've been given by faith and it can be hard to give by faith you're just like I mean y'all keep talking about this building y'all keep saying Giving To Dream Builders and nothing's happening but you've been given by faith and you have now given 420 four $428,000 toward the purchase of a building so as of today as of today our debt and loan to own this building would be 2,772 th000 when you minus the 428,000 off the 3.2 million so so here's what we're asking you to do between now and the closing date on June 17th would you pray would you ask your heavenly father what you can give over and above your tithe the tithe is what we use to operate the church but over and above your tithe what you can give to dreambuilders so that we can purchase this building with as least amount of debt as possible here Pastor Chris and I we would love to have that debt load to be $2 million or less so that we can move as quickly as possible to expand the building and we're both people of Faith me and Pastor Chris we talked about it again this morning we're be we're people of Faith we're actually praying for God to do a miracle and how many of you believe that God is able that we could we could be able to purchase this building anybody believe we could do it debt-free I mean anybody have that kind of Faith with me I I really believe and asking God God would you allow us to purchase this building debt free and I believe this as we all pray as we all give sacrificially between now and June 17th over and above our tithe to dreambuilders I believe we're going to see God do a miracle but can we take just 10 seconds and give God praise for what he's done I mean it's pretty amazing how this all came together God we give you praise we thank you Lord so grateful we didn't box God in and get ahead of God and I know Pastor Chris was Jericho marching and moon walking and break dancing and all that he was doing around those buildings but God had a plan and we're thankful for his plan for our People's Church Indianapolis campus amen why you ready to hear the preaching of God's word today I thought I'd preach y a little bit today while I was here I got a word from the Lord that I really

it's the same way in God's kingdom your problems are test and God test you to prepare you for what he has next for your life if you pass the test God knows you're prepared for your purpose you're prepared and he can promote you test produce something inside of you to get you ready for your next season of Life here's what James says let's look at it again James 1:3 because you know that the testing of your Faith produces perseverance let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything when you pass the test they always produce something good in your life the the testing of your faith understand It prepares you for your purpose People's Church there's purpose in your pain your problem is not just a problem it's a test to prepare you for what God has for your life James goes on to say in chapter 1 he says this in verse number 12 blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because having stood the to the test that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promise to those who love him and and James says having stood the test having passed the test you will receive the Crown of Life and James is giving us a principle that we see actually all throughout the Bible if you pass the test you will be rewarded because understand tests prepare you for your purpose but you have to pass the test you have to realize that your trial that you're facing is a test the pain that is breaking your heart is a test problems are the vehicle God uses to prepare you for your purpose and when you understand that every problem every pain every difficulty every challenge is preparing you for your purpose you begin to look at your problems differently you begin to realize no problem it's just a problem it's preparation for my purpose but you have to pass the test in America before a product goes to Market it's first tested I'm so glad they test product before we use them come on how many of you are glad that they test airplanes before you fly they test cars before you drive it they test chairs before you sit in them they test microwaves before you aren't you glad manufacturers will actually test a product from 3 months all the way to 24 months to ensure the product is ready for public use it has to pass the test and if it doesn't pass the test the product stays in testing mode because the manufacturer it has to ensure that the product is safe that it meets quality and regulation standards the the the the manufacturer wants to reduce the the risk of product failure so it will stay in testing mode until it knows it's ready for for public use and some of you are stuck in testing mode because you're not passing the test you're viewing that person who keeps giv getting on your last nerve causing you all those issues you keep viewing them just as a problem but it's actually a test you're viewing your pain is just a big old problem but it's a test you're you're viewing your setback you're viewing your failure is just a problem but it's a test you're viewing that adversity that you're facing at work you're facing some adversity with your family you're facing some adversity at school and you're viewing it just as a problem but it's a test and because you're viewing it just as a problem some of you just keep complaining and complaining about all of your problems cuz you think your problems are keeping you from your purpose but your problems are actually a test God wants to use all of your problems that you're facing get them in your mind problem after problem after problem he wants to use them to prepare you for your purpose God will test you to prepare you for your purpose God tested Abraham Genesis chapter 2122 and verse number one sometime later God God tested Abraham God used test to prepare Abraham for purpose God tested Joseph Psalm chap 105 verse 19 until the time came to fulfill his dreams the Lord tested Joseph's character Joseph I know your brothers wanted to kill you then they sold you into slavery I know you were falsely accused of rape and thrown into the prison I know they forgot about you in the prison but Joseph those problems were not just problems they were a test God tested Moses and the Israelites Exodus 16:4 then the Lord said to Moses I will rain down bread from heaven for you the people are to go out each day and gather enough food for for enough for that day in this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions God used test to prepare the people of Israel for their purpose God tested Joseph job when he allowed the Satan to attack job and job said this in job 23:10 but he knows the way that I take when he test me when he tested me I will come forth as gold and job went through problem after problem but they were test to prepare him for what God had next and God tested David this was the prayer of David in Psalm chap 139:23 search me God God and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if there is any offensive way in me and Lead Me in the way of everlasting and no doubt God tested David in this series that we've titled stay in your lane we've been studying the life of David and we've been learning that David had to get prepared for what God had prepared for him and David encountered test after test and David passed the test and he got promoted to be the next king of Israel and today what I want to do is I want us to look at some of the adversity test that David had to pass and I want you to ask yourself this question as I teach God's word am I passing the test come on would you help the preacher Preach Today just look at your neighbor look at him right in your eyes and just look at him and say are you passing the test go ahead and ask him come on are you pass yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah are you passing the test are you passing the test come on all my note takers write this down write this down write this down let me give you five test you need to pass Five test you need to pass test number one the Forgotten test forgotten test 1st Samuel chap 7 :1 15 but David went back went back went back and forth from Saul to to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem we we've highlighted this several times throughout this series because it's so important to the story of David after David was anointed to be king around 15 years went by before he actually became the king he was chosen he was anointed yet he went right back to taking care of his father's sheep he went to the Palace but he went there to serve King Saul and when you're waiting on God to fulfill his promise in your life it's a testing season and waiting Seasons often times feel like God has forgotten you but waiting seasons are testing Seasons Abraham and Sarah waited 25 years on the promise of God Joseph waited 13 years before his dream began to come to pass Moses waited 40 years before he stepped into his purpose Jesus waited 30 years before he began his public Ministry your waiting season is not a problem it's a test and the only thing worse than waiting on God is wishing that you would have it's a test just because God has spoken something to your heart just because God has called you he's chosen you he's anointed you just because God has given you a dream does it mean you should rush to make it happen well pastor Pastor you know maybe somebody's here going Pastor you know God has spoken to me about being in full-time Ministry and my next step is quitting my job hold up hold up the old saying says some were called some were sent some just went Hold Up Wait on the Lord maybe you feel like God spoke to you and told you that you're supposed to marry that person go that that person is going to be my husband that's going to be my wife and you like my next step is I'm going to go let them know you my you going to be my boo you you going to be my you going to be my wife you going to be my you going to be my husband hold up you might need to go out on the date first come on somebody hey hey hey Ju Just because you have a word from God and you're anointed does it mean you're ready to be appointed The Waiting season is a test if you pass the test God will prepare you for your purpose number two is this you got to pass the test number two the failure test failure test the the the Bible doesn't highlight all of David's failures that have happened just you know all throughout his life and most of us know about the the big failure the Bible highlights when he became king he committed adultery he had the woman's husband murdered but you have to understand that wasn't David's only failure in life he was a flawed human being just like we all are and there's no doubt he faced failure many times throughout his life he faced failure taking care of his father's sheep he faced failure learning how to play the harp no doubt he had family failures interacting with his his siblings and his parents and failure as he was learning how to use the slingshot and we know this about David that he responded to failure in a Godly way because God calls David a man after my own heart he was a man of repentance he was a man who prayed through failure who worshiped through failure who learned from failure who got better from failure and my question today is how do you respond to your failure failure is not the opposite of success it's part of success how are you responding Henry Ford said failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently Albert Einstein said failure is success in progress It's not failure it's unfinished success Bill Gates said it's fine to celebrate success but it's more important to heed the lessons of failure someone once said never let success go to your head and never let failure go to your heart I know you may have failed the class I know that you had to close the business that you started your first marriage ended you got let go from the job you had def file bankruptcy the car got repossessed the house got foreclosed on you didn't get the job you didn't get the promotion but don't let failure get to your heart don't let it stop you from moving forward it's just a test it's there to prepare you for your purpose number three is this number three the family and friends test family and friends test David's life was riddled with relationship challenges he didn't his own dad didn't invite him inside the house when the prophet came to select the next king his oldest brother belittled him and told David that he had a wicked heart King Saul was jealous of David and tried to kill him on numerous occasions he wife his own wife made fun of David praising God his own son tried to steal the Kingdom from him David had to pass the family and friends test and Pastor Chris next week is going to talk more about about this about how we deal with hurt and pain and wounds and life but I want you to know that we all face the family and friends test and we all all have to learn how to respond correctly when people hurt us we got to learn to pass the test all of us get offended by the things people do and the things people say to us getting offended is a part of life living offended is a choice will you pass the test by guarding your heart from a fence or will you fail the test by allowing a fence to grow in your heart you have to pass the family and friends test number four is this the finance test the finance test from from a young boy David encountered the financial test he was entrusted with the responsibility of taking care of his father's sheep which were the which was the primary income for the entire family and David was a wise Steward of all the resources that God entrusted to him and one day David's dead told he told him hey David I want you to take this bread this grain this cheese down to your brothers they're in the valley of elaw fighting against the Philistines and I want you to take that take this down to them and I want you to see what scripture says about David in 1st Samuel 1 ver chapter 17:20 it says early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a Shepherd I love this that David made sure sure that the Sheep were taken care of while he was gone he was responsible with the resources that were entrusted to his care it goes on to say he loaded up and set out as Jesse had directed he reached the camp as the Army was going out to its battle position shouting the war cry Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other now catch this David left his things with the keeper of supplies ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were and I just love the Bible I love how the Bible points out these little details and it shows us how David was responsible with the resources entrusted to his care he he had the bread he had the grain he had the cheeses and he said before I run down to the battle lines I'm going to give them to The Keeper of the supplies to make sure that they were taken care of he was passing the finance test and I love what the Bible says here in 1st Samuel 7 17:15 it says but David went back and forth forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem David was going back and forth back and forth from the king's Palace back to take care of the sheep from the king's Palace back to take care of the sheep he was serving the king but he also wanted to ensure that his daddy's sheep were being taken care of David was responsible with the resources entrusted to his care question are you responsible with the resources that God has entrusted to your care preparing for God's purpose will require you to pass the financial test you have to manage well what God has entrusted to your care that means spending less than you make every month you're paying your bills on time you're saving money for a rainy day you're investing for the future you're tithing and giving to God did you realize that tithing is a test Malachi 3 and: 10 says bring the whole tithe that's 10% of our income into the storehouse the local church where you worship now catch this that there may be food in my house test me in this says the Lord Almighty and see if I will not throw open the flood gates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it and everybody wants God to bless their life and to bless their finances to bless their future everybody wants God to promote them everybody wants to step into their god-given purpose but the question is this how are you managing the resources that God has already entrusted to your care are you passing the test look at your neighbor and just say those first four I know weren't for you but this last one is go ahead and tell them yeah yeah yeah this this last one I know it's for you I know I know it's for you here it goes Point number five point number five point number five the fight test you got to pass the fight test David Fought The Lion and the bear David fought the Goliath this giant named Goliath David passed the fight test and it prepared him for his purpose Church the Giants that you're facing in your life are a test you have to fight the Giants you're facing with spiritual weapons you've got to fight with prayer you got to fight with worship you got to fight with the word of God you got to fight with church you got to fight seeking the face of God you got to fight with faith you have to fight the Giants to get promoted some people think well if God just wants me to have it it'll just be easy if God just wants to do it it'll be easy no it's a fight to fulfill the call that's on your life your purpose is on the other side of the giant I like what the Apostle Paul says in 2 Timothy CH 4 and: 7 he says I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith you have to fight the good fight of Faith hey People's Church living out God's purpose for your life is a faith fight you've got to learn to fight a spiritual fight fight you got to put up your spiritual dukes and say oh no devil you're not going to stop me from doing what God's called me to do I'm putting on the full armor of God and I'm fighting the good fight of Faith the Giants you're facing right now are a test every problem in life is not just a problem it's a test pass the test and you'll step to your purpose I'll go back to this scripture and I close with it I want to minister to you to your heart would you open your heart up to the Holy Spirit to let him speak to you right now as I just Minister this verse James 1 vers2 consider it pure joy my brothers and sisters whenever you face Trials of many kinds James says choose the right perspective when You Face trials it's a test choose Joy don't just whine don't just complain choose Joy because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance realize your problem it's not just a problem it's a test if you will pass the test it's going to produce something good in your life to prepare you for your next season let perseverance finish its work don't quit during the testing season don't stop don't give up Let it finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything pass the test and you will be promoted"
gDq6OfJCeWo,today we are continuing our series called dysfunctional why relationships are not working and today the title of my message is this why my interactions with difficult people are not working you know we began this series the Sunday after Easter and we talked about why relationships are so challenging week one we talked about human relationships are so challenging because of side effects we covered seven side effects and I want to revisit those seven side effects that make relationships so challenged number one is we blame each other number two is we deal with out of control anger third we deceive and lie to one another the fourth side effect is we hold people's past against them the fifth is we are jealous of one another the sixth as we betray and hate one another and the seventh is we're not faithful to one another with human beings we can encounter these side effects we encounter difficult people truth be told difficult people are everywhere can I get it amen come on difficult people are everywhere author Max Lucado he said some people have been called to be missionaries of misery sent into our world to wreak havoc come on wave at your pastor if you've had some missionaries of misery in your life come on Wave just you've had some missionaries of misery in your life and if you didn't wave at me you want to know why you might be that missionary you might be that uh um joking Maybe today I want to teach you how to get better at dealing with difficult people look at the Bible look what the Bible says in second Timothy chapter 2 verse 23-26 . it says again I say don't get involved in foolish ignorant arguments that only start fights a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone be able to teach and be patient with difficult people gently instruct those who oppose the truth perhaps God will change those people's hearts and they will learn the truth then they will come to their senses and escape the devil's trap for they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants these verses are very insightful on how to get better at dealing with difficult people and difficult conversations this is going to be our main text for the day and and the first thing I want you to see is this the first step is you need to determine you need to determine if you should Engage The difficult person second Timothy 2 23 it says again I say don't get involved in foolish ignorant arguments that only start fights there are times that you should not engage a difficult person the the Greek word for foolish is morose that's where we get the word and Paul is saying don't get involved in ignorant unlearned and foolish arguments some of you you're having such a struggle with difficult people because you're engaging in arguments that you should be avoiding see we live in a culture that loves to argue in person and on social media people will argue over everything people will argue over food who got the best fries it's rallies stop it okay we don't even need to talk about it but but you know a people of star I'm ready to fight over some fry argue over music and books and sports and politics and should you travel when you should travel how to travel argue about vaccines and social Gatherings and masks in church and school and kids we love to argue and when people argue everything is a 10. it's like a 10 they get so people they argue it with passion and Paul is letting us know that not everything is level 10. not everything is worth your energy and you see this time and time again in scripture look at First Timothy chapter 1 verse 4 it says don't let them waste their time and endless discussion of myths and spiritual pedigrees these things only lead to meaningless speculations which don't help people live a life of faith in God first Timothy 4 7 it says do not waste time arguing over Godless ideas and old wives tales instead train yourself to be Godly there are some things not worth your time don't get sucked into every argument First Timothy chapter 6 verse 20 and 21. it says Timothy guard what God has entrusted you avoid Godless foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge some people have wandered from the Faith by following such foolishness you need to avoid some discussion second Timothy 2 14 remind everyone that these things and command them in God's presence to stop fighting over words such arguments are useless and they can ruin those who hear them second Timothy chapter 2 verse 16-18 avoid worthless foolish talk that only leads to more Godless Behavior this kind of talk spreads like cancer as in the case of hymenius and philitus they have left the path of Truth claiming that the resurrection of the dead has already occurred in this way they have turned some people away from the faith listen stop engaging in worthless foolish talk you should be avoiding now listen there are times you should so there's times we should not engage but there are times you should engage a difficult person see Paul is not saying never engage difficult people if you do it in the right way and at the right time it can be a good thing to reason with to plead with to present your case to defend truth with a difficult person there are definitely times we should engage difficult people Paul who told Timothy not to get involved in foolish arguments engaged in difficult conversations acts 18 4 it says every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue trying to persuade Jews and Greeks Acts 19 verse 8-9 it says Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God but some of them became obstinate they refused to believe and publicly maligned the way so Paul left them I want you to notice this Paul set a boundary he established a boundary he took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus there were times Paul engaged in arguing and reasoning the truth with people but Paul knew something that some people don't understand there's a time to walk away from the argument there are times you need to put a boundary in place with certain people some of you are struggling with difficult people because you're allowing them to cause pain to cause drama and Chaos in your life there are times when you need to establish boundaries after engaging a difficult person see sometimes a boundary is best for you and for them so many Christ followers don't realize that boundaries are biblical listen you are not required to set yourself on fire just to keep someone else warm oh yeah tweet that tweet it tick tock it and stick whatever you want to do with it but you are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm Titus Chapter 3 Verse 9 and 10 it says do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws these things are useless and a waste of time it says if people are causing divisions among you give a first and second warning after that have nothing more to do with them Titus said there are times you got to put some distance between you and the other person three strikes and boundary Romans 16 17-18 it says and now I make one more appeal my dear brothers and sisters watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's Faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught stay away from them such people are not serving Christ Our Lord they are serving their own personal interest by smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people the colonians 3 14 it says take note of those who refuse to obey what we say in this letter stay away from them listen boundaries are biblical second Timothy 3 verse four and five it says they will betray their friends be Reckless be puffed up with pride and love pleasure rather than God they will act religious but they will reject the power that could make them Godly stay away from people like that boundaries are biblical II John 10 and 11 it says if anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ don't invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work boundaries are biblical for some of you the best thing you could do is establish some boundaries with a difficult person in your life next thing I want to do is I want to give you seven principles for engaging a difficult person because there are times we should not engage but there are times we need to and when we do I want to give you seven principles for engaging a difficult person number one is this be focused on Solutions with difficult people not a fight be focused on Solutions not a fight second Timothy chapter 2 verse 24 it says a servant of the Lord must not quarrel Paul tells Timothy don't be quarrelsome difficult people love to argue they argue for arguing's sake they're disagreeable just to be disagreeable don't let a disagreeable person make you become disagreeable they're just some folks they they just want to push your buttons they just want to argue and fight and they're trying to poke and they're just doing all that they can listen they will suck you into a fight they'll get you sidetracked and you start fighting with them instead of trying to get the issue resolved Proverbs 29 11. it says fools that their anger but the wise quietly Hold It Back here's what I want you to do respond don't react respond don't react don't react and start fighting instead respond and stick to the problem at hand don't let difficult people cause you to react the way they do listen when you react they're in control of you when you respond you're in control of you when you react they're in control of you but when you respond you are in control of you you control you don't let them control you respond don't react now number two is this be kind to difficult people second Timothy 2 24 a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone I know what some of y'all thinking you serious pastor come on really everyone I got to be kind to everyone yes your Bible says Christ followers should be kind to everyone it's not easy but it's Jesus's way see people who don't know Jesus will be kind to people who agree with them look like them vote like them think like them but Christ followers we're called to be kind to everyone not just those who agree with us Ephesians chapter 4 verse 31 and 32 it says get rid of all bitterness rage anger harsh words and slander as well as all types of evil Behavior instead be kind to each other tenderhearted forgiving one another just as God through Christ has forgiven you hear me being mean bitter full of rage anger harsh words slander doesn't make you more effective when you're talking to a difficult person no it actually makes you less effective kindness will always get you further with difficult people than being unkind mean and rude so you got to be kind to difficult people number three be patient with difficult people second Timothy 2 24 it says a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone be able to teach we'll talk about biblical truth in a moment and it says and be patient with difficult people difficult people love to attack your character start name-calling they'll Clique accuse you of having wrong motives or they'll bring your past failure and flaws and try to get under your skin they don't listen to you they don't want to hear your point of view and if you get impatient with a difficult person the situation only escalates and you use the ability to effectively get the problem resolved patience is key when dealing with difficult people Proverbs 15 18. it says a hot tempered person stirs up conflict but the one who is patient calms a quarrel hot tempered impatient people only stir things up instead of calming things down a Chinese proverb says if you are patient in one moment of anger you will escape a hundred days of Sorrow Ephesians 4 2 it says always be humble and gentle be patient with each other making allowance for each other's faults because of your love be patient and stay calm and remember they have faults and so do you so let's make allowance some allowances for their faults it's also important to understand some things about difficult people I think understanding it it helps us be patient Proverbs 14 29 it says people with understanding control their anger a hot temper shows great foolishness but people with understanding control their anger listen you got to understand that a lot of people have good Hearts but bad practices you got to understand that hurt people try to hurt people wounded people try to wound people it will help you be patient with a difficult person when you understand the hurting they're wounded if they knew better they would do better they have poor habits poor life skills poor communication skills and so be patient so that you can think clearly and you can carefully respond to them it's not always easy when someone is being difficult but it's always best to be patient so you can get the problem resolved number four be gentle with difficult people second Timothy 2 25 it says gently instruct those who oppose the truth perhaps God will change those people's hearts and they will learn the truth be gentle versus being aggressive you won't win people over being aggressive it's a story of a little boy with his mom a little boy's mom told him to stop playing with the toy and sit down he didn't listen to his mom and she said aggressively you better come on you know when your parents start talking through their teeth you better put that toy down and get in that seat story says the little boy sat down he looked at his mom he said I'm sitting on the outside but I'm standing on the inside and then the mama let me show you how to sit on the inside no I'm just playing but listen you don't win people over by being aggressive Proverbs 15 1 it says a gentle answer turns away Wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger number five be biblical with difficult people be biblical with difficult people second Timothy 2 25 it says gently instruct those who oppose the truth perhaps God will change those people's hearts and they will learn the truth be biblical don't dig your heels in over something that's not even worth fighting over I see people arguing with difficult a difficult person over something that's not even worth talking about it's just their opinion and it doesn't even really matter I once was having a conversation with a difficult person that was trying to tell me Tom Brady is better than Peyton Manning the devil is a liar you better back it up let me tell you about oh I was I was ready we about to start arguing and I was like you know what it's not that big of a deal let me let me let me back away let me back away because but you know what some things aren't worth fighting over they're not and and seriously when when someone is opposing the truth of God's word be sure your argument is rooted in Scripture be biblical present truth number six be for the difficult person winning in life second Timothy chapter 2 verse 25 and 26 it says gently instruct those who oppose the truth perhaps God will change those people's hearts and they will learn the truth then they will come to their senses and escape the devil's trap for they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants some people get into a heated conversation with a difficult person and they lose sight of the real win and that's to help the difficult person win with God and win with life sometimes they need Jesus they need hope they need love and you can get so caught up in a debate and your win becomes being right your win becomes proving a point your wind becomes Defending Your Position listen you have to care more about the person than the argument you're never just responding to an argument but to a person you're not just wrestling with ideas you're speaking to a person a person who has a story a person who have feelings and never forget a person who is loved by God created by God made in the image and as a plan and purpose from God listen the goal is not to win the argument the goal is not to be right the goal is to help the person win with God and win and life be for the person winning in life and then number seven be aware the difficult person is in a spiritual battle second Timothy 2 26 then they will come to their senses and Escape From The Devil's trap for they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants listen everything is more spiritual than you realize everything is when you're in a conversation with a difficult person you got to remember everything is more spiritual than you realize sometimes they're under the devil's influence when you realize it's more spiritual then you realize you pray for them even when you don't like them even when they're on your last nerve and you're frustrated you pray for them Matthew 5 44 Jesus said but I say to you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you when it comes to dealing with difficult people remember this quote from SD Gordon it will change how you deal with difficult people he says this you can do more than pray after you have prayed but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed listen we got to pray first you're in a spiritual battle pray first pray first don't argue and debate first pray first pray first it's spiritual business you need God's help you need the help of the Holy Spirit you need the fruit of the spirit and self-control you need peace you need patience you need God's help because again the goal is to help them win with God and win in life and it's spiritual and you may be the only person in their life that's showing them Jesus with your self-control that's showing them Jesus with your kindness and your patience that's showing them Jesus listen listen listen you gotta pray pray first

Martha that one of the root causes of busyness is we're easily distracted from what really matters let's look back at that story Luke chapter 10 verse 40 and 42 the Bible says but Martha was distracted everybody say distracted by all the preparations that had to be made she came to him and asked Lord don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself tell her to help me Martha Martha the Lord answered you are worried and upset about many things distracted but few things are needed or indeed only one Mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her so many of us are distracted because we are worried about many things and only a few things are needed see if the enemy can't destroy you he'll distract you he knows that distractions will delay you that distractions will deny you that distractions will derail you distractions will defeat you that distractions will destroy you there's some folks in the Bible got distracted and it caused him I think about Eve she got distracted by the fruit she knew what God Said but the fruit looked so good and she got distracted I think about David and David went up on the roof just wanted to admire the city and heard some Splish Splash Bathsheba just taken a bath oh baby you you got what I need guard guard come here and David got distracted distracted Samson was distracted by compromise over and over and over again matter of fact he got so distracted by compromising judges 16 20. it says when Samson awoke and just thought that he was going to get up and defeat his enemy like he always did he was so distracted that he didn't even know that the Lord had left him distracted see the interesting thing about being distracted is it's hard to detect that you're distracted until you crash I didn't realize I was distracted until I literally crashed into my house Lot's wife will call her Lottie she was distracted by the past God told lot and Lottie to leave the city and don't look back but Lonnie got distracted my old friends her old home old Hobbies old way of life and she looked back Levi lesko said this he said the destruction of distraction is difficult to detect when it's happening because it doesn't involve bad things but good things that take the place of the most important things Lottie got distracted by good things and it wrecked her life her husband needed her but she got distracted her kids her family needed her but she got distracted and she missed out on What mattered most distractions are dangerous and so today we're going to talk about Weapons of Mass distraction and what because one of the reasons we're so busy is because we're so distracted and so Jesus brilliantly unpacked Weapons of Mass distractions in mark IV he talks about seed that was sown in four different places and as he describes these four different places Jesus explains the biggest Weapons of Mass distraction for all Humanity let's look at the first one we're going to call it the path heart distraction look at Mark chapter 4 verse 13 through 15. it says then Jesus said to them don't you understand this Parable how then will you understand any Parable the farmer sows the word some people are like seed along the path the path heart distraction where the word is sown and as soon as they hear it Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them see there is a real devil that wants to steal the seed of God's word in your heart he doesn't want you to know God's word he doesn't want you to believe God's word he doesn't want you to live your life by God's word he doesn't want you to understand it or apply it he wants to steal it John 10 10 it says the Devil comes to steal kill and destroy and the number one thing the devil wants to steal from you is the word of God see when somebody comes to church and gives their life to Jesus and they they leave church and the immediately the devil tries to distract them with old friends old sin and old places so that he can steal the word of God see the devil doesn't care if you come to church as long as you don't believe God's word is true and if the devil can't destroy you he'll distract you from the word of God he'll steal the word of God from Your Heart Church there's a real devil who's doing everything he can to distract you and to steal the word of God from you you're in a spiritual battle against a real spiritual enemy the the second place that the seed fell was was the rocky place this is the rocky heart distraction the rocky heart distraction Mark 4 16. it says others like seed sown on Rocky places everybody say rocky places hear the word and at once receive it with joy but since they have no root they last only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word they quickly fall away the first thing Jesus said about the rocky places is that they have no root some are distracted because they have no root one of the keys to having a strong faith is God is you got to get your roots Deep In Christ you can't be satisfied with just being a Christian you have to get your roots growing deep into Jesus so that you can overcome the weapons of mass distraction look what Ephesians 3 verse 16 and 17 says it says I pray that from his glorious unlimited resources he will Empower you with Inner Strength through his Spirit then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him and it says your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong at People's Church we want your roots to grow down deep in the Lord as your pastor it's important to me that you're not just a Christian but that your roots are growing deep into Christ Colossians 2 7 it says let your roots grow deep let your groups let your roots grow down into him and let your lives be built on him then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught and you will overflow with thankfulness when your roots grow deep and down into Christ then your life will be built on him that's why we have 21 days of prayer fasting in January that's why we have 21 days of Prayer in August that's why we encourage you to pray and read your Bible that's why we tell you to get water baptized come on today we had six people already get water baptized can we thank God come on six folks went public for Jesus lives changed took that next step of Faith that's why we have the four-week challenge we say attend church every Sunday because the Bible says when you are planted when your roots grow deep in God's house when you're planted in his house you will flourish that's why we encourage you to get into a small group to go through through growth track and get on the Dream Team every one of those steps deepens your roots in Christ we got to have our Roots deep in the Christ the second thing that verse talked about is some are distracted by trouble and persecution trouble and persecution are weapons of mass distraction some of you are distracted by the trouble in your life you thought serving God was supposed to be easy when I start serving God oh I won't have any more problems oh life is just going to be so much easier everything is going to fall into place but the opposite's been true since you start serving the lord all hell is breaking loose you would have been trouble on every side trouble at work trouble at home trouble with your money trouble with relationships trouble at church somebody at church oh they said something he did something to hurt you and you're distracted you're like what in the world is going on listen let me encourage you the reason you got trouble is because you're headed in the right direction and the enemy wants to stop you and trip you up and so I can't promise you no troubles but I can promise you the one that can help you get through every single one of those troubles but you can't get distracted folks get distracted and they get busy some of you are distracted by some form of persecution your friends and family make fun of your faith in God you feel like The Outsider the times you even feel persecuted by them you're getting beat up on social media because you believe and live the Bible listen being a follower of Jesus isn't popular in our culture if your roots don't grow down deep into Christ trouble and persecution they will be weapons of mass of distraction the third place is the the thorny heart distraction Mark 4 18. it says still others like seed sown among Thorns thereby say thorns hear the word but the worries of this life the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word making it unfruitful this scripture points out three things we get distracted by the thorny heart distraction the first is distracted by the worries of Life some of you are distracted by the worries of Life matter of fact for most of us it isn't heresy or a total disregard for God that will distract us and derail us from our best life with Jesus it's all the worries of life that distract us car repairs water heater went out kids need to see the doctor taxes need to get done you promised your mom you come over and fix her faucet wedding planning kids practices and games kids need new shoes flat tire applications to fill out bills to pay refrigerator is empty grocery shopping again refrigerator is empty grocery shopping again homework due dissertation to write lawn to mow clothes to wash and the washing machine keeps rattling some of my pastor will you stop I'm trying to focus on the word and you get me distracted bringing up these things when you get distracted by the worries of life it will choke God's word and your life will be unfruitful secondly I talked about distracted by the deceitfulness of wealth the Bible says there's nothing wrong with having money you can even have a lot of money but the Bible is very clear that money into in possessions can distract you from what really matters the most stressed out people in the Planet live in the most affluent countries are money and possessions can distract us from what really matters the the homes the cars the boats the lake house the campers the time shares Investments real estate motorcycle new computers the newest eye Stuff newest video games newest makeup seven different streaming services the latest pair of Nikes the newest downloads have to get the raise the job and the promotion and it becomes easy to become distracted did by money and possessions and not even realize it and when that happens you no longer have money and possessions money and possessions have you and it's choking God's word out of your life and now your life your relationships and your faith are unfruitful the third thing that verse mentioned is distracted by the desires for other things everybody say other things one of our greatest other things weapon of mass distraction in our generation is with us all day every day we carry it everywhere we go and it caused me to crash my car into my house come on we live in the digital age and our phone has calendars email Health info passwords credit cards banking family picks and much more research says on average Americans check their phones 344 times per day that's once every four minutes 74 percent are of Americans feel uneasy leaving their phone at home come on you know how you get when you lost your phone hey where my phone you touched my phone why'd you touch my

Arm's Reach guilty 53 percent of Americans say that they have never gone longer than 24 hours without their phone seventy percent of Americans check their phones within five minutes of receiving a notification come on you've been tempted to check your phone eight times since I started preaching this sermon resistance I had a brother last service like Pastor I promise I was taking notes on my

of y'all can't get a second date or maybe you're doing it on purpose I don't know but three in four Americans admit to using their phone while on the toilet studies show the average cell phone is 10 times dirtier than toilet seats and only one in seven Americans clean theirs oh don't you borrow somebody's phone who knows what you put on your face that is somebody praising the Lord for the speakerphone [Music] let's talk about YouTube YouTube is the world's second most visited app website users spend almost 24 hours each month on the YouTube mobile app every minute more than 500 hours of new content is uploaded onto YouTube on average a visitor spends 14 minutes and 21 seconds on YouTube every day that's almost 86.5 hours a year that's over 3.5 days of your year spent on YouTube then we got streaming 37 percent of Netflix subscribers binge watched series at work that's two to six hours of work not happening while you're paid to be working I'm just gonna leave that between you and the Lord 70 of Americans between ages 30 and 44 often binge watch TV shows or films ninety percent of Millennials and members of gen Z binge watch and 361 000 Netflix subscribers admitted to watching all nine episodes of Stranger Things 2 on the first day of its release and we haven't even talked about social media the average person spends two hours 27 minutes a day on social media and the average lifetime that is six years and eight months of their life on social media 210 million people suffer from social media addiction ten percent of teens check their phone in social media feeds throughout the night all night long every time they get a notification they grab their phone and see what it says teens that are spending at least five hours a day on their cell phone and social media are 50 percent more likely to suffer from depression multiple Studies have shown that the more addicted you are to your phone into social media the more prone you are to depression and anxiety and the less productive you are in school and in work which feeds the cycle of depression and anxiety this vicious cycle there are a lot of weapons of mass distraction that's choking God's word out of people's lives and making so many people live lives and relationships that are unfruitful there's been a couple times where Jamie and I were driving maybe we're picking up a kid or we're going on a date night and sometimes we been in a deep conversation talking about something and and I'm driving I miss my exit I just I got distracted I wasn't paying attention and every time I do that it it caused me time make me late but listen when you're distracted in life the ramifications are so much bigger in life when you're distracted you don't miss a turn you miss your kids growing up you don't miss your turn you miss meeting your spouse's greatest needs you don't miss your turn you miss loving God with all your heart you don't just miss a turn you miss the signs that your health is eroding you don't just miss your turn and wreck your car you end up breaking your life because of weapons of mass distraction so let's talk about the fourth place that's the good heart the good heart Mark 4 20 it says others like seed sown on good soil hear the word accept it and produce a crop some 30 some 60 some 100 times that was sown listen if you're going to defeat the path the Rocky and the thorny distractions you have to cultivate good soil in your heart and so I want to close this message but to help you go from being distracted to dedicated to help you going from unfruitful to fruitful

changes you need to be prepared to make changes you ever have somebody they apologize to you over and over again about the same thing you're like I don't want your apology I want you to change see

GEnzKdEIfJc,well today we're continuing our series called throwback and the title of my message today is no more excuses no more excuses you know with school just starting a few weeks ago i thought it would be fun to look up what are some of the top excuses for not turning in homework top excuses how about my dog ate it anybody anybody use that one anybody blame it on the dog i'm seeing a cup no joke in our home uh we have a dog peanut he's not two years old and in his first year he was chewing up everything all right and one day he actually got a hold of one of our kids backpacks chewed it up tore it up and actually chewed up the homework that was inside so we had to call we'd say listen this is really not an excuse the dog ate the homework how about this one it slipped out of my hands and blew away that's why i'm late i was running after it i couldn't catch it i don't know if anybody ever used that one or i thought this one was unique i left my homework in the back of a pickup truck and they went through a car wash and ruined it i just don't know what to tell you i'm so i won't put the homework in the back of the pickup again how about this one last night i thought today was saturday not friday oh i got confused on what day it is here's another one oh my dad forgot to do my homework for me i don't think that one's gonna work out for you too well or how about this one my grandma died again poor grandma who would confess did anybody has anybody my grandma oh man you're not right if you said your grandma died and she's alive um all of us can struggle with making excuses work excuses marriage excuses dating parenting excuses money excuses exercise excuses eating excuses god excuses have you ever gave god a great excuse as people in the bible did there are people in the bible they gave god some great excuses eve said that snake made me do it adam said the woman you gave me made me do it esau said i would have died if i didn't eat that stew naaman said i can't dip in this water because the rivers back home are cleaner moses said i don't speak eloquently jeremiah said i'm too young sarah said i'm too old in luke 14 20. a man said i just got married in proverbs 22 13 it says the lazy person says i can't go outside because a lion might eat me and aaron said i threw gold into the fire and just out popped a golden calf i know i've given god so many excuses of why i couldn't do [Music] what he was asking me to do i know early in my faith my excuses were that i'm a new christian i'm barely a christian i don't i don't know enough about the bible i'm i'm scared i'm nervous i don't i don't i'm afraid to speak in public excuses i've had excuses of my anxiety or i don't know the right people if i just knew the right people or i'm too introverted god i i don't have the charisma i'm not a good enough leader i'm not a good enough preacher i'm i'm not sure i have what it takes to be a lead pastor let alone plant a church what excuse are you giving god a lot of you are giving god excuses of why he can't use your life you've become a professional excuse maker you have some really good excuses i know i do but the problem with our excuses is they keep us from experiencing god's purpose and power and so i want us to look at an old testament hero that was a professional excuse maker in his name is gideon look at judges chapter six verse one it says the israelites said evil in the eyes of the lord and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the midianites if you don't know the history the israelites were the people god's chosen people in the old testament and they were held captive in slavery for over 400 years by the nation of egypt and god used moses to lead the israelites out of captivity the israelites they were now free they settled in their own land and they started to disobey god again and they ended up in slavery again to a group of people called the midianites and the midianites treated them horribly they burned up and destroyed all their crops they took all of their animals and the israelites were starving the bible says in judges 6 6 midian so impoverish the israelites that they cried out to the lord for help israel cried out to god god help us these men were starving they're damaging all of our crops they're hiding they're scared their animals all their food their livestock has been taken and they cried out to god and whenever god wants to accomplish something on earth here's the way god does it god always chooses and uses people god always chooses and uses people judges chapter 6 verse 12 it says when the angel of the lord appeared to gideon he said the lord is with you mighty warrior in verse 14 it says the lord turned to him and said go in the strength you have and save israel out of midian's hand am i not sending you when israel cried out to god for help because they were hurting and struggling god chose a person gideon to save them see god uses people to fix problems god uses people to help people god uses people to answer someone's prayer when god wants to do something in a group of people or at school or a university or in a workplace in a church in a city in a state in a nation or in our world god chooses a person whenever people need help need clothing need food or shelter need resources need to hear the gospel need salvation they need discipled they need a friend god always chooses a person and today god is choosing you he's choosing you who me yes every one of you some of you you recognize that god has chosen you to impact a group of people others of you are going to realize for the first time that god has chosen you to make a difference in a group of people's lives the god of heaven and earth has chosen you you're chosen by god look at first peter 2 9 it says but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation god's special position possession that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into wonderful life and first thessalonians chapter 1 verse 4 it says for we know brothers and sisters loved by god that he has chosen you ephesians 1 4 for he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight john 15 16 jesus said you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit fruit that will last so whatever you ask in my name the father will give you god has chosen you to bear fruit just like gideon god has a group of people he wants you to impact for his glory and so this is what i'm asking i'm asking god to stir up your heart to stir your heart and give you vision about a group of people he is calling you to impact maybe it's tutoring kids maybe it's single moms maybe it's being a male presence or role model for kids or teenagers maybe it's helping the homeless helping the addicted being a foster parent maybe it's teaching kids about jesus in one of our people's church kids classrooms maybe it's being out in the parking lot and waving at folks or being a greeter and helping us have a warm and friendly environment every sunday maybe it's helping people take one step spiritually and caring for them as a small group leader you are chosen by god there's a group of people who need to be impacted by the love of god and god has chosen you god always chooses people and so the question is what keeps us from answering god's call see god's chosen people always have to overcome their excuses god's chosen people always have to overcome their excuses what what's standing in the way of some of you being used mightily by god is your excuses and there are real tensions pressures problems issues and concerns that keep you from answering god's calling so i want to help you today i want us to look at the three top excuses excuses you have to overcome three top excuses you have to overcome and we're going to learn these from the life of gideon here's the first one the first one is the lord is not with me the lord is not with me look at judges chapter 6 verse 12 through 15. it says when the angel of the lord appeared to gideon he said the lord is with you mighty warrior verse 13. pardon me my lord gideon replied but if the lord is with us why has all this happened to us where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said did not the lord bring us up out of egypt but now the lord has abandoned us and given us to the hand of midian one of gideon's top excuses is that he feels that god isn't with him let me give you three reasons why he feels that the lord is not with him and i see many christians struggle with these same three reasons the first is this i would see more evidence if god is with me gideon said i've heard about these wonders and miracles god did for our ancestors but i haven't seen god moving like that in my life come on we've all been there if god is really with me then why doesn't he do miracles like he did for those people god is blessing them but he's not blessing me like that since i don't see god working if he wants to use me he's gonna have to prove it to me he's gonna have to make it super evident he'll have to give me an awesome dream or someone's gonna have to give me a word from god but listen you gotta know that evidence does not determine your calling like here is your evidence that god wants to use you you are still breathing that is all the evidence you need as you are breathing all right you're breathing he says the lord is with you gideon here's another one i would have a better life if god was with me gideon said why has all this happened to us if god is with us why isn't our life better than it is why has all this happened why are we in slavery why are we going hungry why am i going through this why all this pain why are things so bad if god wanted to use me to make a difference my life would be better no no no get in get in your circumstances do not determine our calling somebody needs to hear that today your circumstances don't determine your calling god does let me give you the third reason i would not have this bondage in my life if god was with me gideon said god can't be with us because we are in bondage to our enemies we got free from bondage in egypt but now we've fallen back into the bondage of the midians if god is with us we wouldn't be in bondage and some of you feel the same way god you haven't chosen me because i keep falling back into bondage you set me free and then i fall right back into the same sin same bondage same bad relationships same wrong friends same bad habits list god doesn't want to use me because my life is a mess hear me today in spite of your bondage god has chosen you you are chosen by god stop disqualifying yourself god hasn't disqualified you you're chosen instead turn from your sin and turn to god listen he has people he wants you to impact your bondage doesn't determine your calling you are chosen by god let me give you a second topic excuse we have to overcome my family is too weak my family is too weak judges 6 15 pardon me lord gideon replied but how can i save israel my clan is the weakest in manasseh gideon doesn't believe god has chosen him to impact other people's lives because his family is weak god my family doesn't have enough resources god can't use me because my clan is weak we don't have enough resources my family's poor we're struggling to make ends meet how could god use someone with my lack of resources hear me today your resources don't determine your calling your financial worth does not determine your spiritual worth you are chosen by god and that's all you need but my family's too busy with life bills getting has to be come on you trying to you god i'm trying to hide this wheat i'm trying to save my family god i don't have time to save how can i save israel when i can't even save myself i can't even save my family how am i going to take care of somebody else when i can't even take care of myself i don't have time to help the nation you got the wrong person god this is the wrong time life is way too busy and one of the biggest excuses people give god is my life is too busy god our kids are just they're too small right now or our kids are in activities oh god our kids are grown and we got grandkids work is busy life is busy come on yo that speed kills series don't you miss one week of it september 11th our world has a problem with busy busy is wrecking people's lives and you think god can't use me to help others i'm too busy listen your busyness does not determine your calling you're chosen god does but my family's not connected or recognized god you can't use us because nobody knows my weak family people don't know us we don't have name recognition if only we had some clout in our community but we aren't connected to the right people my family is weak and some of you feel like god can't use you because of your family hear me your clan doesn't determine your calling you are chosen by god and he has a group of people he wants you to help let me give you the third excuse that we have to overcome i am too weak i am too weak judges 6 15. pardon me lord gideon replied but how can i save israel my clan is the weakest in manasseh and i am the least in my family gideon feels like he is the worst candidate god i am the worst i am the last person you should choose i am the least i'm not only on the weakest clan i am the weakest of my clan i think you got a mistake i think you need to look at somebody else it is not me and some of you you feel like idiot you feel like you don't have the talent not spiritual enough i'm not a leader i do not have enough experience and so i want to give you four declarations you need to make to overcome your excuses four declarations you need to make to overcome your excuses here's the first deck your declaration my god is with me my god is with me judges 6 12 it says when the angel of the lord appeared to gideon he said the lord is with you listen if you are a christ follower the lord is with you god is with you you got to get that in your heart and in your mind the lord is with you got to stop talking and living like god isn't with you you got to stop saying god isn't with you and you got to start saying god is with me the lord is with me you can overcome your excuses and do what god called you to do because god is with you listen to what else god told gideon in verse 16 it says the lord answered i will be with you god says i'm not just with you now but i will be with you if you do what i told you to do church god says he is with you now and he'll be with you as you do what he's calling you to do and so you got to start saying god is with me now and god will be with me god is with me you got to make that declaration here's the second declaration you need to make i am mighty i am mighty judges 6 12 it says the lord is with you mighty warrior some translations say mighty hero or mighty man of valor see god didn't see gideon the way that gideon saw himself gideon saw himself as the least god saw him as mighty and the way you see yourself is not the way god sees you god sees you as a mighty warrior he sees you as a mighty man mighty woman of valor he sees you as a mighty hero god sees you as chosen for greatness he sees you as more than a conqueror you gotta start saying what god says about you start saying i am mighty

rIAqob57a-M,well today we are continuing our series called throwback and so this whole series we've been in the old testament this whole series we have been looking at old testament heroes and we have been learning just some life faith-building lessons to help us uh in all areas of life help us in our faith and i've titled my message today redeeming love redeeming love and today the old testament hero we're going to look at is hosea i'd never heard of the story of hosea until i went to bible college and it quickly became one of my favorite stories in the bible matter of fact i'd say many aren't very familiar with the story of hosea and so we're going to look at it today and i believe it's one of the most unique stories in the bible let me explain why i say that hosea was a prophet of god he loved god he served god with all of his heart he was a man of character and integrity chosen by god to speak to god's people for god and god told hosea this man of god this prophet to go marry a lady named gomer everybody say gomer not a very flattering name and she wasn't living a very flattering lifestyle gomer actually was a prostitute look at hosea chapter 1 verse 2. it says when the lord first began speaking to israel through hosea he said to him go and marry a prostitute so that some of her children will be conceived in prostitution this will illustrate how israel has acted like a prostitute by turning against the lord and worshiping other gods how would you like that assignment like i don't know if i'm signing up for that one lord i mean i mean yeah that's not a very promising assignment can you imagine just imagine with me the conversation between god and hosea you know and so god calls hosea hosea and jose is like yes god i'm your vessel i'm your tool use me i'm your prophet i'm ready to go and speak to your people god what do you want me to do and god says i want you to go marry a prostitute can you say that again god can you speak you speak into my other ear i don't i don't think i heard you right did you say that you want me to marry a prostitute you you want me to go marry somebody that's going to be unfaithful to me you want me to marry somebody that's going to leave me for other men god is that is that what you're saying and god said yep that's what i'm that's what i want you to do like what like what is going on and if you read the story hosea being a man of god man of faith he honored god obeyed god and he married gomer and sure enough after they got married gomer continued in her pathways of promiscuity she cheated on hosea multiple times and finally abandoned him i'm sure hosea thought well at least that's over and after she left hosea god told hosea go after her what like this is messed up right like i know somebody like hold up pastor chris he's supposed to be an old testament hero like are you sure he's not an old testament sucker like what is going on why would god tell hosea to go after gomer after she was unfaithful cheated on him i mean she's a horrible i mean if any of us were friends with hosea we'd be like hey man you need to cut her off don't chase her hey man you need to freeze the credit cards change the locks delete her number out of your phone block her on social media no you need to get rid of her dump her may you listen you need to move on no no you need to tell her it's too late to apologize you know it's too late it's too late no you need to tell gomer to the left to the left everything you own in the box to the left set on fire don't ever come back like i i just like man no hosea and listen that advice would have been good in 99 of the cases this one was different because there is a message about god hidden in the mess of this marriage god had a deeper point and word and message he wanted his backslidden rebellious and adulterous people to understand about his heart his character and his love so let me ask you a question today have you ever felt unlovable never felt worthless never felt you weren't worthy of god's love i i know that i have and i've i've i've messed up i've made some mistakes i've played the hypocrite i've lied to people hurt people before christ i lived a life of drunkenness and sexual immorality and struggled with lust and i've missed the mark and i have messed up i have fallen short i have done things i have regret come on am i the only one in this place that has made some mistakes lord i'm never going to say that again and then you do lord if you forgive me i promise i'll stop watching that and then you slip up lord i'm sorry about the attitude i've been having with my wife hey chris could you help take out the trash girl i'm praying i'm trying to seek god over here talking about the trash lord i'll start telling the truth tomorrow and then the lies arise we all have struggles shortcomings and sin stories that have tripped us up and maybe just maybe still do today we've done some things that have made us feel were unlovable unforgivable see guilt has a grip that takes the life out of living and what we're going to learn today is that god is using hosea's life as an example of god's mercy his patience his relentless pursuit and of course his redeeming love and so i want to look at three important truths from the story of hosea what they teach us about god's redeeming love for people number one the first truth is this god's love is unconditional god's love is unconditional let's look at hosea 3 one again hosea has abandoned or excuse me gomer has abandoned jose she's left him she's she's been unfaithful and then in hosea 3 1 it says then the lord said to me go and love your wife again even though she commits adultery with another lover this will illustrate that the lord still everyone say still the lord still loves israel even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them gomer more than once was unfaithful turned her back on hosea abandoned him heard him humiliated him and yet he still loved her no matter what she did good or bad hosea loved her and pursued her see hosea is literally a scripture picture of just how remarkable god's love is for you and i pastor what do you mean by scripture picture i'm so glad you asked the reality is is we all have a little bit of gomer in us are we just keeping it real some may have a whole lot of gomer in them maybe you've wandered turned your back on god denounced him never really trusted him maybe for some you've done what some would say is unthinkable some of us can relate to gomer she didn't know god she was lost living a life full of sin she was a mess and so full of brokenness and shame and maybe this is you today maybe your life is a mess stuck in sexual sin addicted to pornography ravished by drugs or alcohol maybe you're living a lie you you may be here at the lowest of lows of your life and maybe maybe you struggle with lying maybe you've been disrespectful to your parents maybe just maybe you're a new england patriots fan oh god for i'm just playing i love y'all i just a poke just got a poke but maybe you're a cheater thief maybe you messed up this past weekend cursed god maybe you don't even believe in god a gomer you need to hear this god still loves you let me say it again god still loves you his love is a rescuing love he's looking for you and he hasn't stopped looking for you his love it's a redeeming love he paid a price for you his love it's a relentless love he will never stop knocking on the door of your heart it's a real love he'll never leave you forsake you or turn his back on you and this can be so hard for us to comprehend because most things in our life are based off conditions we are used to being loved based off how good we are what we do maybe what we don't do and let's be honest if you were jose or i was hosea it'd be pretty hard to love gomer we would have a hard time loving gomer because a lot of our love it's based off conditions anybody ever written somebody off oh i know i have oh you're done that's it i can't do it no more i've given you try after try i've trusted i've helped you're done you are cut off but thanks be to god he doesn't cut off his love we have breaking points god doesn't with his love we have limits to our love he has no limits to his love there's nothing we can do to make god love us less and nothing we can do to make us love us more he loves you period he loves you period john 3 16 for god so loved the world everybody say the world for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son the the world in the greek it means world it means the whole world everybody in the world including the gomers of the world you mean pastor that god loves a prostitute with the same amount of love that he has for the prophet yep hold up doesn't god love a good christian that goes to church and reads their bible and prays every day more than someone that's a cold-blooded murderer nope he loves them the same now listen obviously there are blessings that come from obedience and there are consequences that come from sin but god loves everyone the same he loves everyone unconditionally there's nothing you can do to make him love you more or less his love is not based off how good or how bad you are it's not based on good works look at ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 and 9. it says god saved you by his grace when you believed and you can't take credit for this it is a gift from god salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done so none of us can boast about it your good works don't make him love you more and your mistakes don't make him love you less he loves you period god's got love for all of us gomer's and there is nothing you have done or can do that disqualifies you from his love his love is unconditional and so you need to receive this truth into your heart today god loves you god loves you god loves you god loves you god loves you period here's the second truth i want us to learn from hosea and it's this god loves you so much he paid a price for you see god tells hosea go find your wife and when hosea finds her she is being sold as a slave and look what happens in isaiah 3 2 it says so i bought her for 15 shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethic of barley he probably could have bought her back for pennies nobody wanted her but he paid a high price let me let me give you some insight to what hosea actually paid to buy gomer some scholars believe that a shekel to be worth about 80 dollars in ancient times which means hosea paid about one thousand two hundred dollars let me give you even more context of that in that time a family could live off of a shekel for two weeks hosea paying 15 shekels was also the equivalent to feeding and providing for his family for 30 weeks that is over half a year's wages but wait there's more he also gave a homer and lethic of barley which was equal to 15 shekels and so scholars believe he did this because he didn't have enough money to buy her back between the 15 shekels and the homer and lethic of barley hosea paid a year's worth of wages to buy back gomer church it came at great cost for hosea to buy back gomer he literally gave all he had to buy her back and this is just an incredible picture of god's love see the reality is in most people's eyes she was not worth a penny she should have paid hosea to take her back she had messed up fallen away and found herself in a mess and hosea shows up sees his wife in chains broken for sale and refuses to let her live in slavery he pays the high price for her freedom because of his love for her and listen we have the same story with god we know god's love but at times we choose our own ways sin looks good but it has a price we can't afford to pay life leaves us broken in chains so god's love has the final say and the good news is this we can be free through jesus today come on god sent jesus to pay the ultimate price to bring freedom jesus paid for our sin paid for our shame he breaks the chains that hold us he gives us a new name you are not what you did you are not what you've been through you can look up and thank jesus because he holds the key to every chain they may have you in bondage and he paid the highest price he gave his life for you for all humanity why because he wants a relationship with us and he paid that price knowing some of us would reject god the same way gomer rejected hosea look at romans chapter 5 verse 6 through 8 it says when we were utterly helpless wandering going our own way christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners now most people would not be willing to die for an upright person though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good but god showed his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners while we were still sinners god paid a high price for us we didn't deserve it and we never will grace is a free gift god didn't pay a price for us because we were deserving we didn't earn it regardless of what we do or don't do he paid a high price for us period and so we need to get this truth in our heart today he paid for your sins out of love his love doesn't change when we wander or struggle you have never gone too far and done too much to disqualify you from god's love jesus says to you today you are worth dying for you're worth dying for and you don't have to pay a price for your sin he he paid it all all you have to do is accept it and so from hosea we learned that god's love is unconditional god loves you so much he paid a high price for you and the number three is this god never stops loving you god never stops loving you back to hosea 3 1. it says then the lord said to me go and love your wife again even though she commits adultery with another lover this will illustrate that the lord still loves israel even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them see before gomer was a prostitute god loved her while she was a prostitute god loved her after he loved her and just like god told hosea to show love to his wife again god will continue to show you his love again and again and again and again god never stop loving gomer and he will never stop loving you look what jeremiah 31 3 says about god's love it says long ago the lord said to israel i have loved you my people with an everlasting love with unfailing love i have drawn you to myself god's love just hits different it's everlasting it's unfailing his love never ends his love is for everyone and that means you no matter how many times we mess up you can count on his love because it's unfailing it's everlasting you never hit a point where god's love runs out it reminds me of a worship song your love never runs out on me the chorus in that song says your love never fails it never gives up it never runs out on me your love never fails it never gives up it never runs out on me i have admitted many times that uh i love starbucks and although they keep raising them prices i don't know they i told you my love's conditional y'all it's it's conditional but uh throughout the year if you're a starbucks gold card member they have they send you these emails hey we're gonna play uh we're gonna do this game summer games or around winter and like every time you buy a drink you get like a play right and that play um you know you may uh win a free drink or you may get some stars or oftentimes you know you got to get three of the same and then you can win some big prize which i don't know if anybody ever wins but they always have starbucks for life and so sometimes when you get a play they get to choose you where do you want to put your play towards do you want y'all i'm starbucks for life every time i'm just believing someday somehow i'm gonna get star bucks for life come on i love some jehovah java you know what i'm saying like i want it for life that means it never ends it's always free whether i want to use it or not i got it it's mine and it's for life and it is at my disposal at any time of the day it is unending and you need to understand god's love it is unending whether we accept it reject it walk away from it look into it it's always there is there from birth to death whether you're 10 years old 40 or 100 his love is still there it's like the energizer bunny it just keeps going and going and going and going from the womb to the tomb god loves you his love is ever and i remember as a teenager i remember being in high school with some different thoughts about god's love i remember believing that i had run out of god's love and his forgiveness i remember thinking many times because of all my sin and things i did beliefs i had times i doubted god even cursed god didn't believe for god i remember believing there's no way god could love me i remember being in church services yeah that's a good message and i'm sure god loves some people in this room but he doesn't love me i remember thinking i had made too many mistakes could have easily felt like a gomer what was interesting is that as i felt that way at the same time i always felt his presence pursuing me it's the hardest thing for me to wrap my mind around was god's everlasting unfailing and amazing love and it took a whole year i was stubborn took a whole year but finally one day i just submitted i surrendered and my response to his love was i just gave him my life i gave my life away and it's the best decision i ever made in life i stopped rejecting his love i stopped running from his love i stopped trying to define his love and who he loves and who he doesn't love and i finally surrender and it changed my life i've been saved over 20 years and you know what i do today with this love i just keep surrendering to it i i still don't understand it but i'm thankful for it and i'll worship him and because of his love i give him everything i don't hold anything back i gave it to him then i'm still not perfect i still got issues i still even got a little bit of gomer in me from time to time but thank god for his love everlasting unfailing unconditional i was worth him dying for and that it never runs out come on would you stand with me i just feel the the proper response to his love right now
8tbsHH0V6Dg,but I want to dive in uh to our message today we've been in this series called Miracles nothing is too hard for God and today I want to talk to you about the miracle of the first the miracle of the first there's something powerful powerful about first can we remember your first child your first baby when they were born and you held them in your arms I'll never forget holding our firstborn Jays and you just had he just kind of opened his eyes up and he had just like just just little cry he like he just had a little meow cry and I'll never forget his I remember the first car ride with the baby your White Knuckle in it you know what I mean only driving 20 M an hour down the road you got the first step that your baby takes you have the first word a baby speaks da da more often than not sorry moms that's what they say just CU it's easier but the first time you rode a bike remember the first time you rode a bike without training wheels oh you were bad you were moving I remember the first time I rode my bike without training wheels I was so excited I was like look Mom boom boom ran into a mailbox I'll never forget that first first day of school butterflies first time on an airplane first time playing a team sport or School sports come on that first touchdown you scored or that first basket you made first time sipping a caramel Brule latte oh oh yeah I just had my first sip uh this past week I'll never forget my first date my first date with Jamie we went to Cheesecake Factory she remembers what I wore that day I don't remember what she wore because that but that's just because I was so captivated by her beauty I was just lost in her eyes I can't I didn't never got to the outfit because she was so beautiful we all have first and first are a big deal in our life and they're a big deal to God look at Exodus 13:2 it says consecrate to me every firstborn male the first Offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me with their human or animal early on God was establishing that he wanted to be first God always wants to be first Nehemiah 10:35 we obligate ourselves to bring the first fruits of your ground and the first fruits of all fruit of every tree year by year to the house of the Lord God wants to be first in our living and our giving Exodus 34:26 it says bring the best of the first fruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God God wants to be first in our living and our giving look at Deuteronomy 18:4 it says the first fruits of your grain of your wine of your oil and the first fleece of your sheep you shall give them God wants to be first in our living and our giving 2 Chronicles 31:5 it says as soon as the order went out the Israelites generally gave the first fruits of their grain new wine olive oil honey and all that the fields produced they brought a great amount a tithe of the first 10% of everything God always wants to be first in our living and our giving Proverbs 39-10 it says honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruits of all your crops then your barns will be filled with plenty and your Vats will be bursting with wine God always wants to be first in our living and giving Matthew 6:33 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well first are a big deal to God he established the principle of the first and God wants to be first in every area of your life God always always wants to be first and God says when I'm first I will bless your life when I'm not first my blessing will not rest on your life this is the principle of the first and we see the principle of the first all the way back to to the very first family before the law was introduced you see the principle of the first Adam and Eve the first human beings they had their first children Cain and Abel they had their first family squabble they had their first sibling rivalry started in the beginning the Rivalry went around it it was around their first recording of worshiping God you have the first mention of the word sin the first mention of the word murder the the first family is where you see first first see the principle of the first let's look at it Genesis 4:1 through five it says Adam made love to his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain she said with the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man later she gave birth to his brother Abel now Abel kept flocks and Cain worked the soil in the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord and Abel also brought an offering fat portions from some of the firstborn I want you to notice that Cain brought some but Abel brought from the firstborn of his flock the Lord looked with favor on Abel in his offering but on Cain in his offering he did not look with favor so Cain was very angry and his face was downcast I want to give you three powerful truths about the principle of the first number one is this the principle of the first has always been important to God Genesis 4:3 is the most critical verse of the entire story it says Cain brought some but he didn't bring the first I'm just curious where my pumpkin pie people at we got any pumpkin pie people in the house here pumpkin pie pumpkin pie okay I'm not a big pumpkin pie person but where my sweet potato pie people at oh I like me some sweet potato pie you you ever been Thanksgiving and someone's like hey I got the pie I'mma bring the pie and they bring the pumpkin pie they bring the sweet potato a pie and you peel back the foil and half the pie is gone what is this you brought me leftovers was it even fresh when did you make it you ate it before you brought it you probably don't say those things but you're thinking those things aren't you you're like I'm never asking you to bring the pumpkin or sweet potato pie again thank you so much cuz you're like what do you mean what you mean half of is gone what is going on God's the same way it doesn't settle with God to get your leftovers he doesn't want some of the pie he wants the First Slice on our kids' birthdays they get the first slice of cake it's their special day and God gets the first because he's special he's God he's Lord and can and able both show up to a worship service and Cain brought some of the pie but not the first Cain didn't prioritize putting God first he was casual and careless in his worship he was living by by the principle of me first instead of God first the difference between Cain and Abel wasn't that they didn't give to God both gave to God but one gave his leftovers and one gave his best and his first to God let me teach you a couple things here number one the principle of the first is so important to God that he made it a right and wrong issue look at Genesis 4:7 if you do what is right will you not be accepted but if you do not do what is right sin is crouching at your door it desires to have you but you must rule over it God told Cain that he did what was that he did what was wrong because he didn't give to God first he violated the principle of the first and God didn't accept his offering see God is never satisfied with being second third or fourth place in your life life and what's super interesting to me is that God did not accept his offering just because you worship and give to God doesn't mean that your worship and giving is acceptable to God God says there's a right and a wrong way to worship and give to him you worship and give to God first let me ask you are you struggling to put God first in your life are you struggling to put God first in your daily schedule by praying and reading your Bible and worshiping every day you struggling to put them in your weekly schedule by being at church every Sunday are you struggling to put them first bi-weekly and monthly by by tithing and giving are you struggling to put them in your yearly schedule but with prayer and fasting listen the principle of the first is all about seeking God first instead of you first it's pursuing God first in every area of your life instead of putting you first whenever you put God first He blesses your life that's the principle of the first you want your dating to be blessed put God first you want your marriage to be blessed put God first you want your parenting and children to be blessed put God first you want your education to be blessed put God first you want your career to be blessed put God first you want your money to be blessed put God first you want your future to be blessed put God first second thing when you don't put God first sin will rule over you Genesis 4:7 if you do what is right will you not be accepted but if you do not do what is right sin is crouching at your door it desires to have you but you must rule over it when you don't live by the principle of the first you're choosing to live you centered life instead of a god- centered life you're choosing to put you first instead of God first first you're choosing to put you at the center of your life instead of putting God at the center of your life when you put you verse the Bible says that sin it is crouching at your door and it will pounce on you the Bible says it desires to have you or Master sin is just waiting for you to put you first just waiting crouching this is the imagery of an animal a ly just sitting there and waiting for you to put yourself first so he can pounce on you that's what happened to Cain s pounced on Cain and wrecked his life because that's what sin does look at Genesis 4:8 it says now Kain said to his brother Abel let's go out to the field while they were in the field Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him sin pounced on Cain and he killed his brother whenever you put you first instead of God first sin will rule your life it may not be murder but sin will rule you anger and greed and selfishness will rule you stinginess lying lust cheating Pride hatred will rule you Church don't be like Cain and live you centered look what the Bible says in 1 Jane 3 32 1 John 3:12 it says do not be like Cain who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother and why why did he murder him because his own actions were evil and his brother actions his brothers were righteous a strong Cain's first actions were evil but Abel put God first and his actions were righteous when God's first is righteous when God's not first is evil it's a right and wrong issue because God always wants to be first number two on the principle of the first number two the principle of the first reveals the condition of your heart Genesis 4:5 and six it says but on Cain in his offering he did not look with favor so Cain was very angry and his face was downcast then the Lord said to Cain why are you angry why is your face downcast I went to the doctor to get an x-ray on my elbow and that x-ray it it identified what the natural eye couldn't see the principle of the first it xrays the condition and motives of our heart you can say God is first but the principle of the first reveals where your heart really is is God first in your yearly schedule is our annual 21 days of prayer and fasting on your calendar if it's not put it on today I want you to put God first in 2024 it's January 7th through the 27th 21 days of prayer let's put God first at the beginning of the year is God first in your daily schedule every day do you pray do you read your Bible do you Worship Is God first weekly is church a priority every Sunday you're in God's house is God first bi-weekly and monthly are you tithing and giving above the tithe and offerings matter of fact how you spend and invest your money is an x-ray into your heart that's what the Bible says in Matthew chap 6: 19- 21 Jesus saido not store up for yourselves Treasures on Earth where moths and Vermin destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven heaven where moths and Vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also Jesus said show me where your money is going and I will show you who and what has your heart when you look at your checking account savings account credit card statements who and what has your heart are are you storing up your money and treasure on Earth or are you storing your treasure in heaven are you tithing and giving to God in his kingdom are you living me centered or a god centered life see Cain's giving it revealed the condition of his heart and his heart was full of selfishness pride and anger it was me centered and then number three the principle of the first brings the favor of God Genesis 4:4 it says and Abel also brought an offering fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock the Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering what a powerful statement the Lord looked on favor on both Abel and his offering when we live by the principle of the first a result is the favor of God God's first li God first living brings favor favor is God's demonstrated delight and Abel had God's favor Cain chose to worship and give to God on his own terms and he forfeited the favor of God hear me today Church don't forfeit God's favor by worshiping and giving to God on your terms worship and give to God on God's terms his terms Cain did it on his own terms and was living and giving by the flesh but Abel he was living and giving by faith look at Hebrews 11:4 it says by faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did by faith he was commended as righteous when God spoke well of his offerings and by faith Abel still speaks even though he is dead see Cain gave God his leftovers it doesn't take Faith to give God your leftovers it doesn't take Faith to throw a few bucks into the bucket when it passes by to pay all your bills or whatever you have left over and then give some to God but it takes Faith to give to God first it takes Faith to say God before I I pay my house payment my rent my electric bill before I go grocery shopping I'm tithing and giving to you first the principle of the first is living by faith not by flesh and Faith brings the favor of God into your life and you and I we get to choose if we want to live by faith or by flesh your choice will determine God's favor your choice will determine God's blessing your choice determines the Miracles you experience Cain had a choice and he chose anger jealousy and murder and he continued to choose me first instead of repenting and choosing God first Cain's choice of living by the flesh it led him to an undesirable decisions and to un to an undesirable Destiny look at Genesis 4: 9-12 it says then the Lord said to Cain where is your brother Abel I don't know he replied am I My Brother's Keeper the Lord said what have you done listen your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground now you are under a curse and driven from the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand when you work the ground it will no longer yield its crops for you you will be a Restless Wanderer on the earth this is such a sad story God gave Cain an opportunity to put him first but C still chose me first the question of the day is how will you respond will you respond with faith or flesh Faith or facts Faith or fear will you choose God first or you first will you experience the favor of a God first life or the frustration of a me first first life the Miracles of a God first life or the misery of a me first life the pleasure of a God first life or the pain of a me first life Matthew 6:33 but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be provided to you the miracle of all these things being provided it happens after you put God first Proverbs 39 and10 honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruits of all your crops then your barns will be filled with plenty and your Vats will be bursting with wine to honor means to esteem to place have value in so many people honor themselves instead of honoring God they esteem themselves in instead of esteeming God but if you honor God by living and giving to him first he will bless your life he wants to be first in every area of her life put him first God first God first God first and so listen I want to help you out here I want to give you some next steps if you're not tithing would you start tithing would you put God first would you take the step of Faith put God first matter of fact at People's Church we got a three-month tithe challenge you can pull out this card it's a money back guarantee you tithe three months here and and you don't believe God has blessed you re se you his favor in his life just call us up and we'll refund you all your money would you would you test God and put him first test God and put him first would you be consistent and said well Pastor Chris the J what what do y'all do to be consistent we set up reoccurring giving online that's how we're consistent

you put you will never ever go wrong putting God first and I can just speak to you from my own personal experience but I'm telling you you won't experience it until you do it till you take a step of faith and put God first let's pray if you'll bow your heads and close your eyes
l2yeHZCSu2U,so I understand there's some people in the room today you've been attending People's Church long enough to where Pastor Chris is probably the only person you have ever heard preach in the pulpit and you're like they got the youth pastor up here this is going to be good or this is going to be bad so there's two things uh you need to know about me as a preacher one I believe in doing what the Bible says giving honored whom honors do we did that already we're good uh the second thing though is I'm I don't really know the name for it I call it a holler back preacher and other way like I didn't grow up in the church that was really really quiet if you did praise God I had no issues with that man I love that every church is different I did not grow up in that church though so what I tell our students on Wednesday night middle school and high school students at Epic is I say hey you cannot talk back to your mama but you can talk back to me when I'm preaching so I want everybody to know today that that rule applies for you as well so I'm giving you a heads up if you hear somebody yell amen hallelujah or preach it white boy that last one's their favorite I don't know why but if you hear it don't be alarmed you're safe it is okay and hey I don't know why that's your favorite but it works you're like oh Lord what are we getting into I already called today I think I called it fall back Sunday when we spring ahead uh probably because I like fell back into bed of when I woke up this morning these are the jokes they don't get any better so now I'm gonna preach if that's okay if that's all right hey we are in the middle of this series uh called I wish I would have and some of you were thinking this morning I wish I would have went to bed an hour early last night some of you were thinking man I wish it wouldn't have snowed in addition to Spring Forward Sunday but the the thought or the subject I want to talk to you about today as we continue this series the title of my message is this I wish I would have known sooner how practical steps can lead to spiritual victories I wish I would have known sooner how practical steps can lead to spiritual victories here's what I believe I believe that God has specific Divine spiritual victories in store for your life in 2023. I believe that and you're like how do you know that why do you believe that because I don't know about you but God is a god of Victory Our God likes to win one thing if you know my wife or if you ever talk to my wife one thing she can tell you about me or anyone in my family anyone close to me I am a sore loser I hate losing like it's not even that I'm competitive I just hate losing I really do so like being a Pacers fan being a Colts fan has been really really hard for me this year because I hate losing whether it's my height the state championship my senior year in high school playing basketball or a monopoly was just me and my wife and our apartment I do not like losing and can I just tell you today man not only does our God not like he hates losing but he can't lose and he doesn't lose so why would you believe the lie that God would not want you to experience Victory when he himself cannot lose and all he does is win and so God wants you to experience Victory but here's what I also believe too I've learned that life is more spiritual than we realize life is more spiritual than we realize in fact many of the challenges many of the obstacles you're facing today whether it be in your marriage with your kids on your job in your health in your finances they are all in fact very spiritual in origin what do I mean by that you see I I want us to to I want to propose to you this morning that our steps to experiencing spiritual victories are more practical than we realize in other words I think many times as as Christians we can kind of be what I call Spooky spiritual like we we believe that or we assume rather that our victories are our blessings our breakthroughs they're just kind of floating out somewhere like in the spiritual realm far beyond our reach and just kind of out of our grasp beyond our involvement but I believe something differently because when I look at scripture I can't help but see it's so interesting how God was so intentional to clearly reveal that there is in fact a connection between our physical obedience and God's spiritual blessings some of your life pastors are gonna have to give me a scripture for that so that's what I'll do if you remember the story some of you may remember from Joshua chapter 6 God told Joshua and the Israelites to go into Jericho to March around the walls seven days and on the seventh day you go seven times around and when you stop you shout and the walls will fall Joshua and the Israelites they obeyed and breakthrough came and we know the walls fell and they took the city now I I'm not only a passionate preacher who gets loud hollers but I'm also transparent so can I just be real with you for a second you and I both know that's a dumb military strategy that's horrible like they're lining up like you want us to do what Joshua like what if they shoot at us like like I work with teenagers so I could ask like interesting questions all the time I just see Joshua like yes you in the back and he's like what are we gonna do if they shoot at us I don't know God said March just March bro like we gotta listen or what about this story is wild it's in Matthew chapter 17. it's one of those I like how to read it a couple of times I'm like what uh Matthew chapter 17 Jesus is having a conversation with one of his disciples named Peter and they're talking about taxes awesome so they're having this conversation about taxes going back and forth on are we going to pay our taxes okay we are going to pay our taxes how are we going to pay our taxes and Peter or sorry Jesus tells Peter he goes here's what I want you to do Peter here's how I want you to get the money to pay for not only your taxes but my taxes Jesus pay taxes y'all that's messed up so anyways he tells Peter I want you to go out I want you to start fishing take the first fish that you catch open its mouth and you will pull out a large silver coin that will be enough money for you to pay for your taxes and me to pay for my taxes sure enough Peter goes and he obeys he does what Jesus says and sure enough that is exactly what happened he pulls a coin out of the fish's mouth and he pays for their taxes now here well I asked myself why would Jesus do that like why didn't Jesus like he I just see this going down this way like Jesus looking at Peter and he's telling him like what we're going to do we're going to pay our taxes we don't want to upset anybody oh Peter hey what's that behind you here oh look at that hey all right go take it to the bank like go go give it to the government you know what I'm saying like no Jesus didn't perform a miracle right there in front of him didn't make the coin appear behind us here like uh like a magician like why did Jesus do it this way why would he tell Peter to do that it's because practical obedience leads to spiritual blessing spiritual provision spiritual breakthrough here's what I've learned oftentimes before God does something not only he can do he's first going to ask you to do something not only you can do because our physical obedience is what leads to spiritual blessing when we do the Practical things when you and I take the Practical steps of obedience to God we experience spiritual victories in our lives and just for the next few minutes today if you have your Bibles I want you to turn with me to the Book of Exodus chapter 17 and we're going to look at another powerful narrative in scripture another example that of how practical obedience positions us as God's people to experience spiritual Victory if you didn't bring your Bible today it'll be on the screen Exodus chapter 17 beginning at verse number eight here's what the Bible says says the amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at refered him Moses the leader of Israel sent to Joshua choose some of our men and go out to fight the amalekites tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands so Joshua Fought the amalekites as Moses had ordered and Moses Aaron and her went to the top of the hill verse 11 says that as long as Moses held up his hands the Israelites were winning but whenever he lowered his hands the abalakites were winning when Moses's hands grew tired they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it Aaron and her held his hands up one on one side one on the other so that his hands remained steady till sunset and verse 13 says so Joshua overcame the amalekite army with the sword okay here's my first question after reading this how did they know that's the key to winning the battle that day was they had to do whatever it took to keep Moses's hands in the air how'd they figure that out like they're just sitting there and Moses is like they're getting killed right it's like the IU basketball game yesterday I'm still bitter Andrew preach uh get over it it's basketball but it's Indiana uh so Moses I see Moses like taking a stretch right and then all of a sudden like Israel just starts like literally killing the amalekites and Moses like oh this is awesome guys you got to see this everybody puts a staff down and Israel starts getting killed again he's like wait a minute wait Moses do that again do what again lift your staff up you're like does it and it'll start to it he's like wait uh oh like back if like is that what happened because I said I'm transparent right if I'm being honest with you I'm passionate about people I'm passionate about God's word so I get excited when I preach it but if I'm just being honest with you I really don't understand everything going on or how this works or how it happens but when I observe the text here's what I see when Moses lifted his arms they won when he lowered his arms they lost even though we may not be able to explain it here's what we can't deny it was Moses is physical posture that impacted the spiritual outcome of the battle it was his practical involvement it partnered with God's Supernatural and intervention that led to victory over the amalekites that day and you see here's what I've learned even when it's beyond my understanding and Beyond what my mind can comprehend I've learned that every single word in scripture is there for a Divine reason I've learned that every picture every story God gives us in his word like this it has a purpose to teach us something that is essential to our faith and I believe there are practical steps we can learn from in Exodus chapter 17 that will help us experience victory in our lives and the first practical step we learned from Exodus chapter 17 is this number one you will win when you do God's word you will win when you do God's word now in Exodus chapter 17 I know what some of y'all are thinking like where did God explicitly tell Moses to raise his staff and keep it raised he didn't okay he didn't in Exodus chapter 17 but if you study the book of Exodus the entire book chapter to chapter you will find it was a a regular occurrence for God to come to Moses give him a word give him an instruction give him a command and the Bible says that Moses obeyed let me give you an example in Exodus chapter 14 God told Moses to take his staff and to raise his hand over the Red Sea and when he did the waters parted and the Israelites walked across on dry ground and then God's told Moses again hey I want you to do that again and the waters will cover back up and swallow the Egyptians and that's exactly what happened you see time and time again it was Moses's physical act of obedience that brought about supernatural victory for Israel and unfortunately too many of us today my friends we miss out on so many blessings that God has for us and it's not because we lack knowledge it is not because we lack understanding it's simply we lack a willingness to obey and to do what God's word says so many times it's not a matter of I wish God would speak to me I wish God would tell me what what I need to do because I don't know any better I'm not sure what to do next it's simply a matter of we fail to do what we already know God has told us to do in his word uh I got I got this picture I want to show you of these of these two cats uh they're they're uh my wife's cats they're not my own um so when I got married we got married seven months ago by the way marriage is like the best thing ever but where we really needed to start praying was she goes hey I want a kitten and I'm like okay let's pray about it she's like no I prayed about it got like we're getting one I'm like great welcome to the married life and so we end up with two I don't know how that happened but um so this is Jacob and Esau I'm playing that's it we didn't really name it that you get it they act like Jacob and Esau it's Cain and Abel uh no I'm kidding that's not their names either it's my wife named him y'all for this specific reason because I would have named him something dumb uh but the the darker colored one the bigger one is Remy and the other one is Winnie and they are hilarious but you can kind of see their uh chilling on this cat tower right here and so what I learned about my wife too is like when Christmas time came around like we she was like what are we gonna get uh the book she calls them boys I'm like she's always like you act like you hate cats in public but then you cuddle with them on home I'm like yeah I'm like that's true I'm like Remy's mine when he's hers he's like Remy's like Remy reminds me some of my students at Epic like just fun like energetic the other one he's just like he hates everybody don't want to talk nobody don't want to cuddle so that's her cat anyways now that we're over that we get them this cat tower because my wife's like we got to get something for Christmas and I'm like we're really gonna get something for our pets for Christmas like I grew up with pets and like got him a little something but I'm like we're literally going to spoil these cats like for real she goes yeah like we're getting them this cat tower so I'm thinking okay so we ordered this bad boy off Amazon and I'm thinking like good deal good price whatever and I'm thinking like it's going to come in a box like this already put together I might have to worry about it because if you took growth track you know the spiritual gifts assessment in week three like when I took it it was like preaching you I scored super high like exhortation communicating public speaking it was like really high like pastoring leadership it was like really high and then craftsmanship yeah I don't know how it's possible but I got like negative 17. it was horrible I'm like my wife is a boss Homemaker like she puts all the stuff up I'm like here you take the screwdriver I'm like I will lose my salvation so sure enough it comes in the box right and I open it up and it's in pieces I'm like oh Lord this is not how I want to spend my Saturday because I'm like it's gonna be bad I'm like I might snap at my wife I might throw a cat across the room but I'm like I can do this so I'm like putting it together y'all and it's easy you know you got to remember I was that kid like growing up by the grace of God I could barely put a Lego set together like when I tell you I'm not a Craftsman I'm not a Craftsman at all but I'm putting this thing together and it's going great so far but then finally I get to a point where I'm like I'm missing a piece and I'm like yo I'm like about to call down fire from heaven I'm like babe get Amazon on the phone I want my money back I'm like I might want everything I'm like pleading the blood of Jesus like about to get on the phone with Amazon my wife's like babe did you do what the instructions said to do and how about what do you mean I do with him so I'm like we're missing a piece that was that got to do with the instructions she goes did you look at the instructions and do what the instructions said to do like most men I'm like no I'm like well I need this for so she grabs it and looks and she goes babe you flip this upside down you move this part over and then you just screw this in here and I'm like oh so we're not missing a piece she goes no clearly you did not have this figured out like you thought you did if you would have followed the directions if you would have done what it said this could have been a whole lot easier for you and you would not have stressed out and you know that's how it is for a lot of Christians today live in frustration we live in confusion because we simply aren't doing what we know God's word says it reminds me of James chapter 1 verses 22 through 25. I love what he says he says don't simply or merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says because anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in the mirror and after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like but whoever looks intently or intentionally into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it not forgetting what they heard but doing it they will be blessed in what they do unfortunately today my friend too many churchgoers too many followers of Jesus are deceived because they have this false sense of security that they're living with because they think that having a lot of knowledge about God or having knowledge of God's word is the most important thing but the truth whether we like it or not is that it is not enough my friend to simply just hear the word of God it is not enough to just listen to it or to or to even know it or even believe it when you look into God's word and you hold it up to every single area of your life it's like a mirror because not only do you read it but God's word it reads you and as you do God begin to show you things in your life that need to change like things aren't working in your marriage you go to the Bible and you're like oh wives submit to your husbands husbands love your wives like Christ loved the church oh I haven't been doing that or you're wondering why your finances are out of whack and you're like I'll give generously I'll give give God what belongs to him tithe give him what's first there's no judgment no condemnation but the truth is that when we go to God's word it is like that mirror and the Bible says in the Book of James that the person who merely hears the word of God and doesn't do what it says is like the person that walks up to the mirror sees that they still got sleep in their eyes or they got that pimple right there and they're just like ah look good and they just walk away like cool don't need the brush my teeth don't need to comb my hair and that's the problem for many followers of Jesus today is that God is showing us things we need to change through his word things we need to start doing things we need to stop doing and you have one or two choices my friend you can either choose to do what the word says or you can ignore it but don't be deceived because the blessing is not in the knowing the blessing is not in the hearing the blessing is in the doing when you put the word of God to work in your life it works it will work in your life when the Bible says to love your enemies to pray for those who persecute you to bless those who cut you off on i-465. forgetting you have the people search sticker on the back of your car we do it when the Bible says to guard your heart to flee from temptation to avoid sin we're people of the word we we do it when it says to worship through difficulty when it says to forgive others the way that Christ has forgiven you when it says to to give the tithe and the offering when it says use your talents to serve God and to serve other people we do it because the blessing is in the doing God's word doing what it says is what brings God's blessing that's the first step we want about the second step we learned is this number two you will win when you trust in God's ways you will win when you trust God's ways because spiritual victories come when you trust God even when you don't understand him you know there's when I look at Exodus chapter 17 there is absolutely no way there is no practical explanation that Moses could give for the battle against the amalekites there wasn't anything magical about his hands like Moses could not expect he's like God just told me to do this so I did it that that's it I I don't know I don't understand I have to trust God could you all imagine it's something like if there really was like something powerful about Moses's hands like being Moses kids they're like acting up misbehaving and Moses just like don't you dare make me go get my staff in the corner and I don't have to beat you with it I just gotta lift it up and the kids are like oh we gotta stop that's go and get a staff again like no there was nothing special nothing unique about Moses's hands it was a matter of him trusting God to do what he said he would do even when Moses couldn't physically see how it made sense or how it would result in Victory here's what I've learned in my young life my friend is this there will be times this year in 2023 and there will be times that different points in your life when things just won't make sense there will be times in your life well God will ask you to do something that you don't understand God will ask you to do something that doesn't make sense I remember being a sophomore in college I was at a at the church I attended before People's Church to the church I grew up and I'd been there for five years uh was in Bible College studying uh to become a pastor I was an intern in our youth ministry watched God move and just multiply that youth ministry we're reaching hundreds of kids in our community getting into schools seeing lives changed kids baptized kids serving it was an incredible thing to be a part of I had great relationships with all the pastors on staff with so many of the families in this large church that was thriving and man if I'm honest with you I was really comfortable there after five years I was comfortable in my leadership ability I was confident in my preaching ability I was I was familiar with my environment familiar with the people man my life was good and then I'll never forget the day as a sophomore in college God began to stir Something in My Heart Like Andrew I need you to get ready to transition I'm a transition what you mean like I'm like there's no other door open like like God I'm content here like God you're moving here I want to be a part of what you're doing here here and I'll never forget every time I would pray and wrestle back and forth with God he was just saying Andrew I need you to trust me I need you to trust me I I know what's best I've got this figured out I see what you see I know what you don't know I just need you to trust me and then lo and behold the door open the opportunity came for me to be a part of this amazing church here at People's Church and come on staff as our student pastor and what God has done here because of I don't get the glory for this God gets the glory for this all it was was obedient and he did the supernatural seeing the lives that God has changed in our youth ministry here at People's Church at every location seeing God move in our church on Sunday mornings and through our small groups during the week it has been something powerful and incredible that I would not trade away for anything in this world but can I tell you it's easy for me to say that because I'm on the other side of what trust looks like I'm on the other side of the victory I'm on the other side of the blessing but it's hard to trust God to go when he says go to to do it when he says do it when you don't have understanding when it doesn't make sense it reminded me of Isaiah 55 when God said for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways declares the Lord as the heavens are higher than the earth soar my way is higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts friend life won't make sense what God's asking you to do won't always make sense either God will ask you to love somebody that's unkind to you God will tell you to forgive somebody that's repeatedly hurts you over and over and over and over again and it won't always make sense but here's what the word of God says in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 it right it reads this and without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him if I'm being real I think sometimes as people of Faith as followers of Jesus we forget that our faith is based off our convictions and not on our feelings our feelings are real I didn't get a lot of amens on that one but that's okay our feelings are real our feelings are are they're valid but they're not trustworthy just because you're feeling one thing doesn't mean God is doing another thing it's about walking by faith and not by sight when you've been praying but you haven't seen the answer when you wanted it and how you want it can you still trust God because the true test of the Christian faith it's not if you can trust God when everything in your life is good the true test of one's faith is if you can continue to serve to love to pursue God and to trust him even when life doesn't make sense and when life is challenging do you still trust God man my heart breaks for some of you who have been praying and asking God for breakthrough in your life in so many ways for for months and even years now and how the discouragement maybe you've been through I want to tell you this sometimes God heals sometimes he helps but what I know is this he does always hear us and he always answers prayer come on I still believe in the power of prayer don't give up I'm praying because whatever you've been carrying take it to the Lord in prayer when life doesn't make sense declare it with your mouth I will walk by faith and not by sight because I know that God works all things for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purpose come on even when you can't feel his presence in your life even when there's things happening beyond your control that don't make sense to have faith and trust knowing that God is working while I'm hurting he's working while I'm serving he's working in the lonely places of my life he is working while I'm waiting and while I'm hoping for the Breakthrough to come pray even though you haven't seen the answers yet forgive when it seems like you should take revenge worship when you don't sense his presence because Faith sees beyond what is to what can be and what will be Faith sees past the natural limitations to Supernatural possibilities Faith sees what God sees and not what people sees God works all things for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purpose sometimes you got to tell yourself even if it's not for my good it's still for his glory God's not going to fail and jeopardize his glory and if it ultimately if it's for his glory then it is for my good can you trust God with your health can you trust him with your finances trust him with your family some of you you've not been dreaming big the vision for your life you've been trying to keep it small because you fear getting hurt again you fear getting disappointed you fear getting let down again but can I tell you to have bold faith and to pray bold prayers over your marriage and over your children over your finances over your career because and over your church because trusting God it's the physical steps the Practical obedience that leads to spiritual breakthrough do what you can do and trust God to do well only he can do you that's the second thing we learned and then the third and final thing we learned from Exodus chapter 17 is this and then we'll pray number three you will win when you refuse to quit you'll win when you refuse to quit and here's a Bible verse that if you're a follower of Jesus man you've heard people preach just a mess and quote the mess out of this but it's God's word it's truth and it's life it says in Galatians 6 9 let us not become weary and doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up but I love that Jesus calls himself the lord of the Harvest that means he's responsible for it we don't control the timing of the Harvest because obviously sometimes we have tension with that verse we're like God you said in the proper time like the due season some translations say you're like God we got different definitions of that baju season my proper time was yesterday but God if you want it to be today I won't complain he's the lord of the Harvest he controls the timing he controls the outcome God controls the Harvest but we control the hustle we control The Obedience because sometimes the key to spiritual Victory comes merely from physical perseverance how many all know in Exodus 17 Moses was tired by Moses want a spring chicken y'all that's why we use the phrase older and Moses like he's old sitting on that rock holding his arms up he got tired physically he's fatigued the Bible says he literally sat there with his arms lifted from Sun up till sun down you imagine the weight of an entire nation on his shoulders Israelites depending on him to keep his hands lifted high so that they could win the battle the pressure the fatigue he's dealing with I'm sure he felt like quitting because it was hard but he didn't give up because there was too much at stake to give up he needed his friends to come and hold his arms up and sometimes if we're being honest we do too that's why we have small groups here at People's Church when you're discouraged you have friends to encourage you friends who will tell you to stay in the game don't go don't retreat to the bleachers don't go to the bench don't sit on the sidelines get in the game and take action friends telling you not to give up on your marriage but to fight for your spouse to fight for your kids to fight for your family to not stop going to church how many all know we all need to be surrounded by Voices of Faith in our lives I'll share this quick story with you I remember at a you know growing up and growing up in Ministry being in a pastor's home for several years and now obviously being a Ministry and living and experiencing carrying the weight of that sometimes it you have days where like anything you're called to in life it feels like more than you can bear and you're tempted to quit to give up and to throw in the towel and I remember I felt like the Prophet Elijah you know on Mount Carmel like fire falls from heaven he you know kills all these prophets and then Jezebel's like that's not cool I'm gonna kill you and he's like ah he runs away to a cave right I had one of those moments a while back where we were just coming off an awesome Sunday we baptized like 20 plus people half of them were students I'm like Duncan student after student I'm like man look at What the Lord Has Done it's just awesome that Monday y'all ever had that where you like have that Mountaintop moment and Monday morning hits and it's like bam you get life hits you in the face I I had one of those and I remember hitting a bro like kind of like a Breaking Point in my mind emotionally where I was in my apartment by myself and I literally I can remember where I was standing and I said out loud I said God if you've really called me to do this thing for the rest of my life I need you to show me today yo I don't even know if that's the right thing to do like I was like I'm gonna get struck down or like what obviously I had a moment where I was like God this is where I'm at an hour goes by and uh I get a text message from my dad who is one of my biggest encouragers one of my biggest challenges like child not challenges Challengers like kick me in the pants when I need it and I remember him just texting me out of the blue not knowing what I was going through that day and saying son I love you and I'm proud of you God's purpose for your life is so much bigger than you and whatever it is you're facing today I love seeing God change the lives of those students because of your ministry and I know he's going to use you to turn that whole city upside down don't quit don't give up stay in the game I thought man God that's really cool awesome and then another hour goes by and a buddy of mine in ministry as well text me and goes hey man I just felt led to pray for you today and here's why I'm praying over you Galatians 6 9 don't give up because at the proper time you'll see the Harvest if you don't give up I'm like thank God you two for two let's go and then we had it was y'all it was a Wednesday night of all things I'm like two hours away from preaching I'm like God I need you to show me if this is really what you want me to do for my life then we have an incredible youth service of course but I still walk away feeling discouraged and feeling defeated and then um I call Pastor Chris and I'm telling them about how awesome uh epic was that night he goes man praise God for all that that's so cool but Andrew I really don't care about all that right now and I'm like oh snap all right Pastor what you got he's like I need to know if you're okay it's like holy spirit spoke to me and told you I need to be praying for you today and encourage you because you felt discouraged and defeated I mean he began to pray Galatians 6-9 for me three different times in one day God not only reaffirmed my calling but encouraged me and gave me the grace and the strength to persevere to endure and to not give a church family let me just tell you today Moses had Aaron and her like I hadn't been a Mighty Men of God in my life holding my arms up when I was weak when I was tired when I was discouraged when I wanted to give up and throw in the towel I had men of God in my life hold my arms up like bro don't you dare quit on those teenagers man don't you dare to stop living a life worthy of the calling God gave you from the day you were born don't you dare quit on your marriage don't you dare quit on the vision and the dream God gave you and cannot be honest man God has called every single one of you in this room to be an Aaron and a her for somebody else sometimes we do need people to come and lift our arms up for us that is very true but sometimes we can get so inward focused and forget and not realize that God's also called us to lift up the arms of other people around us could you imagine and that's like not always the easiest thing to do Aaron and her got tired y'all because you I could see Aaron looking at her like bro if I have to smell his armpit for another minute her's like bro why does he get to sit down we're the one holding his arms up I just see Moses kind of like looking at both of them were holding his eyes like y'all want to be Joshua right now you'll be down there with the sword if uh we good we we stay up here all the people the swords are down there you see sometimes you're the one that needs your arms lifted other times you're the one who needs to be lifting someone else's arms this last verse I'll give you and we'll pray First Corinthians 15 verse 58 in the message it says throw yourselves into the work of the master confident that nothing you do for him is a waste of time or effort well friend can I tell you today don't waste your pain don't waste this season of waiting don't waste your season of frustrating by quitting and throwing in the towel that dream that God gave you that purpose is worth fighting for it's worth believing for it's it's worth praying and serving and seeking God for my friend don't give up don't lose heart don't give into the discouragement because how many people are still going to this church because of you because you lifted their arms who here still trusting God because of you who here didn't quit on their marriage a long time ago because you were the one lifting their arms in battle it's your obedience to God through serving through giving encouraging refusing to give up that leads someone else to experience spiritual Victory too don't give up don't lose heart don't give in to discouragement even when it doesn't look like how you want it to look like you want God wants your finances to be blessed sometimes they'll send you a check in the mail and sometimes he'll send you a Dave Ramsey podcast hello man God wants your kids to know him to love him and to serve him man sometimes they may wake up in the middle of the night tears streaming down their face repentance well I'm bad I'm sorry and other nights it may be like you have to drag their butt to Epic every Wednesday night even when they don't want to go well I tell you if you can continue to do what the word says if you can trust God even when it's hard when you don't understand and not give up the Bible says you'll reap a harvest God will come through and do what only he can do if you refuse to quit my question to you today is what if you're only one step away from experiencing a major breakthrough in your life some of you are so close to quitting but you don't even realize how close you are to experiencing the Breakthrough you've been fighting and hoping for
TtItnhkOGdc,I want to draw your attention to John chap 11 so if you brought your Bible uh or it's on your phone you can turn on your Bible or you can turn there in the physical page Pages if you brought it um something a little different about today's message when I knew I was going to be preaching you know I started praying and preparing and earlier this week I was standing in a in a church service it was a youth Pastors Conference in Dallas Texas Monday and Tuesday and wasn't thinking about today at all wasn't thinking about what I was going to say write or preach I was just fully present in the moment and had one of those moments where God really just confirmed a message that was specifically for today I don't know who uh or what situation uh but I believe God's word doesn't return void and if it falls on good soil man it's going to produce a harvest and so that's what I've been praying and believing for God to do today so if you got your Bible we will go to John chap 11 uh beginning at verse number one it says now a man named Lazarus was sick he was from Bethany the village of Mary and her sister Martha now this Mary whose brother Lazarus now lay sick was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair you actually read about that in the next chapter but verse three says so the sisters sent word to Jesus Lord the one you love is sick and when he heard this Jesus said the sickness will not end in death no it is for God's glory so that God's son may be glorified through it now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus so when he heard that Lazarus was sick he stayed where he was two more days and then he said to his disciples let us go back to Judea skip down to verse 11 it says after he had said this he went on to tell his disciples our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I am going there to wake him up his disciples replied Lord if he sleeps he will get better they're like Jesus he's asleeping through his snooze like he had snoozed two or three times like if he's asleep he's going to wake up on his own what's the big deal and it says uh like often his disciples did they thought he was talking literally uh in verse 14 it says so he told them plainly Lazarus is dead he dead dead um he says and for your sake I am glad I was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him the title of the message I want to preach to you today is this it's never too late for a miracle it's never too late for a miracle a couple months back uh my wife and I got an email one day from uh the management office of our apartment complex notifying us that the following day or the next day they were going to replace all of the windows and screen doors in every single apartment so we were like yeah praise God that's incredible new new stuff and uh the problem was with the email came attached to the bottom oh by the way we're starting tomorrow so thanks for the heads up like 10 or 12 hours no so we're like moving everything around in the apartment and like trying to get it ready for the team to come in and they're like yeah we're going to start at 9:00 and try to be done by 5: and I'm like that's great because they were going to do it on a Wednesday and normally I like to work from the church office on Wednesday but this meant I had to stay at home to work a little bit longer uh than usual but I thought hey you know what it's because they're putting new things in our apartment it's a blessing praise God so the next day comes and I'm thinking surely they're not going to get to our unit directly at 9:00 a.m. it's like 8:57 and it sounds like the hallway is being torn apart and you're like they're here and they're going to come in any minute so what I noticed the night before though when we were moving everything around was in our dining room in the corner of the window on the outside there were two and I mean two massive wasps nests and I was like that is not good these window people going to come in and they're going to get a rude awakening and really bad surprise so I get on I get online I contacted Pest Control told him I need to come out soon as possible and just you know take care of that because last thing I want is them window guys that come in be on a ladder they get attacked fall over like I got faith but I don't want to pray for the dead to be raised right outside of my apartment Window if you know what I'm saying so I put their request in I'm like great well they get there super early they knock on our door they're like yeah we're here to change your you know your windows the problem was is they spoke uh they spoke broken English and so like I took Spanish three in high school but it was really just so I could get honors so at best like I remember Spanglish if you know what I'm talking about so I'm trying to tell them hey there's like uh you don't want to pop that window open and I'm like where's Pest Control I'm checking my own my phone I'm checking my emails and like none of them they beat Pest Control there so I'm like man this is a problem so I get one of the guys and I'm like showing them where it is and he looks at me like dead into my eyes deep into my soul and he goes okay and I'm like okay what like you're going to open that window and like what's going to happen I'm like if this dude lets all of these wasps inside my apartment my wife is going to lose it so sure enough he starts opening the window and I'm like y'all ever prayed silently in your head before like cuz you were afraid to pray out loud like I was praying silently and not in English if you know what I'm saying I'm like standing there like Lord please so he opens the window and he pops like that little screen or whatever one of the nests goes tumbling down but the other one stayed attached and two of those Jokers flew into my dining room and I'm like oh no it's about to go down and my wife's like everything okay in there and I'm like yeah it's great like be praying and fasting please like this could be bad and so the window guy I'm like watching him because if he starts panicking I'm gonna start panicking because he obviously had the confidence to do pest controls job he takes off his ball cap and y'all he is like swinging back and forth like trying to and I'm like oh this is going to be bad and I'm like wanting to jump in but I'm like n I'm like no I'll just like I'll pray silently continuously and so finally he knocked one of them out and killed it and I'm like okay we'll see where this goes and over time he finally gets the second one and when he killed that second one he just kind of looks over at me and smiles with the biggest grit I've ever seen in my life and I'm like praise the Lord he knocks the second nest out yo we get our windows replaced we get the screen door replaced and it's all good so then a week and a half goes by I'm sitting in the dining room I'm on a zoom meeting and I hear a knock on the door and so well I guess you can't pause Zoom because it's like live that would be pretty like some of you wish you could pause Zoom that would be great um so I like turn my camera off I get up and I go to the door and I open it and there's a guy standing there in uniform y'all I promise you he looked like he was from Ghostbusters I'm not like so I like stood there and I was like sir I think you got the wrong apartment because the only ghost that lives up and here's the Holy Ghost and uh he go the church joke I had to he goes oh no I'm not with Ghostbusters he's like I'm Pest Control you file you sent a request for me to come out and I'm like looking at him confused and then I'm like wait a minute and then I look at him I'm like bro I called you a week and a half ago and you have the nerd to finally I'm like bro window guys did your job for you like I'm good he's like sweet I get to go home early I'm like bro thanks for showing up when I needed you to not you know I think many of us here today here's why I tell you that story not just to make you laugh uh because it eventually made me laugh I think there's many of us here today we know what it feels like to pray and believe God for a miracle only to have the situation end in disappointment to end with fr frustration or even confusion you maybe some of you you've been praying for healing but your sickness has only gotten worse some of you have been praying for your marriage to be restored but somehow divorce papers entered into the equation some of you you've been praying for provision but it just seems like the bills keep piling up one on top of the other you've been praying to get pregnant but you keep struggling with infertility or you maybe have even experienced a miscarriage you've been praying for a loved one to be saved in your family but they've only drifted further and further and further away from the Lord you know it's very easy to become discouraged and even lose hope whenever you need God to perform a miracle in your life but it doesn't happen or it doesn't seem like it's ever going to happen some of you have been there and that's where you are today if you're just being honest and that's what brings us to our text in John chap 11 the Bible says Jesus had three close friends Lazarus and his two sisters Mary and Martha the Bible doesn't tell us how exactly but Lazarus becomes deathly ill and so Mary and Martha they send a messenger ahead to their close friend Jesus and said Jesus your friend Lazarus remember the one that you love he's sick we need you to come and heal him immediately but the Bible says that Jesus and his disciples they took a different approach you see Jesus and his disciples where they were when they got that message they were about 20 miles away from Bethany where Lazarus was which meant that they could have got there the day of and healed Lazarus he could have showed up that very day but instead he stayed where he was for two days before he decided to go to him but by then Lazarus had already died by then it appeared it was already too late for a miracle Maybe maybe you're here today and you feel like your opportunity to experience a miracle has already passed maybe you feel like it's too late for God to show up and move in that situation in your life maybe God didn't show up just like you hoped he would or when you wanted him to show up in your life you've lost hope you've given up you've stopped praying you've stopped fasting you've stopped seeking and believing and if that's where you are in your life right now I want I want you to know that with Jesus it's never too late for a miracle you know I don't have time this story is 45 verses and some of you're like please don't tell me you're about to preach all 45 verses like Jonathan Taylor signed an extension like we got a ball game to watch today I'm not going to preach all 45 verses y'all laughing but you're like it's a nervous laugh um there's so many Rich observations in this text but there's really only three big ones I want to show you to just Challenge and encourage you to keep praying keep trusting God for miracles because nothing is too hard for God and with Jesus it is never too late for a miracle and this first one when when God gave me this message I'm like God this is the first thing you want me to tell them I'm like this is almost mean but he said if they don't understand this first they're never going to get free to receive the other two and the first thing we learned from John chapter 11 is that God is never obligated to meet your expectations God is not obligated to meet your expectations if you go to verse 17 it says that when Jesus finally showed up Lazarus had already been in the Tomb for 4 days now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother and when Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went out to meet him but Mary stayed home Lord Martha said to Jesus if you had been here have any all just if you had a a real moment with God in private where you said Lord if you would would have been here Lord if you would have showed up she said Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't have died full of disappointment confusion and frustration God I had faith God I prayed God I didn't run to a doctor I ran straight to you Jesus with the with the need hoping for a miracle but if you would have been here it wouldn't have happened God if you would have showed up the divorce wouldn't have been finalized God if you would have showed up my child would would have never gotten that illness Lord if you just would have been there she's full of doubt she's full of disappointment and frustration they you see they wanted Jesus to come immediately to heal their brother but Jesus chose to do something completely different from what they wanted him to do from what they were expecting him to do because they were so close to Jesus they they saw him heal the sick they saw him touch lepers and them be cleansed they saw him open blind eyes open deaf ears they saw him make the mute speak they saw him make the lame walk again they thought man he did it for others why did he choose not to do it for us they're full of disappointment because God didn't step in and meet their expectations he didn't come when they wanted him to and he didn't do what they wanted him to do I think it's so easy for us to be tempted to stop seeking God for a miracle in our lives whenever he doesn't me our expectations when we didn't get the job when we didn't get the promotion when we didn't get the good report from the doctor that we wanted when the panic attacks and the night Tears Don't Go Away when our kids are still having issues at school or at home when we didn't pass the class or pass the exam when the economy is still a mess it's easy to give up and throw on the towel Mary and Martha they're confused they're disappointed they're frustrated and they're hurting you know we often like to preach especi myself included like to preach about the story where you know Jesus is up uh teaching and Mary was the one who was sitting at his feet listening we like the dog on Martha because we're like well she was doing all the work in the house and like didn't want to sit at the feet of Jesus which is like the most important thing to do we kind of just throw under the bus and drive over her but as I was reading John chapter 11 I thought it was interesting it says that when they so they're sitting in grief they're getting and disappointment confusion and frustration they heard Jesus is coming the Bible says Martha went to meet him where he was but Mary stayed in the house Martha don't miss this Martha ran to Jesus with her pain with her disappointment but Mary chose to stay stuck in her grief and her unmet expectations you can either bring your disappointment to God or you can allow your disappointment to keep you from God because the reality is that God will only come as close to you as you will let him Martha was still disappointed Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't have died but notice that the first words out of her mouth she says Lord she doesn't say Rabbi she doesn't say teacher she's even a close friend she doesn't call him by his name and say Jesus she says Lord she even in the midst of heart heartbreak and disappointment she still called him Lord let me ask you this when God doesn't meet your expectations can you still call him Lord when he doesn't show up when you want him to when he doesn't do what you expected him to do do you still call him Lord Jesus said the sickness Lazarus had was for God's glory others would experience it and come to believe in other words God did not heal Lazarus because he wanted to do something bigger and better than what they hope my friend if God were obligated to meet your expectations then he would never have the opportunity to exceed them sometimes God has to choose not to meet your expectations so that he can exceed your expectations Proverbs 19:21 it says many are the plans in a person's heart but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails we all got plans we all got schedules that we deadlines that we want God to meet but we have to remember it's his purpose that prevails sometimes God Will Wait past the point of your expectation so that his power can work in your life according to his will and just because God doesn't always meet your preferences doesn't mean that he's going back on his promises whenever we experience disappointment we need to remember that God is not committed to our expectations he's committed to his glory he's committed to his purpose and that he desires to exceed ceed our human expectations and our Earthly desires even in the midst of suffering and hardship we can overcome disappointment by bringing it to God by choosing to submit to him as Lord and to remain committed see God is not obligated to meet your expectations rather he's committed to fulfill his purpose my friend don't allow disappointment to don't allow your unmet expectations to hinder the greater your work that God wants to do in your life you see not only do we need to understand that God isn't obligated to meet our expectations but we also need to understand that God is not frustrated by your doubts go to verse 21 you're like that sounds a little nicer verse 21 it says Lord Martha said to Jesus you had if you had been here my brother would not have died but I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask Jesus said to her your brother will rise again and then Martha hits Jesus with a good old church answer says I know he'll rise again in the resurrection at the last day she's like Lord like I I've listened to you teach I've got good theology I know the Bible I've got good Doctrine but Jesus said no no no no no I'm not talking about an event he said I am the resurrection and the life the one who believes in me will live even though they die and whoever lives by believing in me will never die do you believe this verse 27 Yes Lord she replied I believe that you are the Messiah the Son of God who has come who is to come in the world see throughout scripture we see people who had tremendous faith and yet they wrestled with doubt so many times you see Martha and Mary they were both struggling with doubt after their brother died and what I love is that Jesus didn't get angry and rebuked them for their vulnerability instead he extended Grace he met them where they were and he loved them he showed them compassion in the midst of their doubt you know what I love about God is he doesn't just want me to come to him with my faith he wants me to come to him with my frustrations he wants me to bring my doubts to him Jesus understands us even when we don't understand him but even here's what I love even in the midst of Doubt Martha demonstrated such strong faith in the Lord go to verse 21 she said Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died but I know that even now even now God will give you whatever you ask in the absence of a miracle that she had desperately needed had been desperately praying for Martha held on to her faith in Jesus God give me the type of faith that says but I know that even now in the middle of this cancer that you're still a Healer God I know that even now you're still a provider in the mid of a jacked up economy even now God I know with my marriage on the rocks that you're still a restorer and a Healer God I know that even now in the middle of this impossible situation you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still a way maker I know that even now you're still good even when life isn't JD Greer once said faith is not the absence of doubt it is continuing to follow Jesus in the midst of Doubt many people think that that faith and doubt cannot coexist with one another that one is like water and one is oil and they do not mix but what I what we see all throughout scripture is that people with great faith wrestled with doubt they brought doubt and Faith to Jesus at the same time but let me tell you this two things that cannot coexist together would be doubt and disob obedience faith and Disobedience because if you look in verse uh let's see verse we'll go back to verse 11 here in a minute he met them where they were he loved them he showed them compassion but you see even though they brought faith and doubt at the same time they still showed trust and obedience in 2 Corinthians 5:7 Paul wrote before we walk by faith not by sight they saw an impossible situation and they had doubt yet they had enough Faith to believe that Jesus was who he said he was and that he would do what he said he would do my friend God is responsible for the outcome but we're responsible for our obedience see don't allow what God didn't do in your life to change your understanding of who he is we need to learn sometimes to question our doubts more than we question our faith because even in the midst of her doubt Mary and Martha they both never stopped believing in Jesus or following him they still called him Lord and they still had faith in who he was that he would do what he said he would do even while they were struggling and hurting because faith and doubt can coexist but faith and Disobedience cannot they remembered all the Miracles he did for others and they had enough faith and chose to believe that he could do a miracle for them too you see we overcome doubt by keeping Jesus at the center of our lives and by choosing to walk in faith People's Church do not let doubt stand in the way of the miracle that you have been praying and believing for God to do in your life for so long you see God is not obligated to meet our expectations God is not frustrated by our doubts and then lastly third thing I want to give you and then we'll pray God is not limited by your circumstances God's not limited by your circumstances some of you all like yeah that's the that's the good church answer but some of you you believe like yeah God heals yeah God restores for other people not for me look at verse verse 34 Jesus asked where have you laid him talking about Lazarus come and see Lord they replied yall go home and tell somebody you memorize a whole Bible verse today in church John 11:35 Jesus wept says that he wept he was moved in his heart he was filled with compassion and trouble so he wept then the Jews said see how he loved him but then this is important verse 37 some of them said could not he who Open the Eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying Jesus once more deeply moved Jesus heard him talking smack y'all he came to the tomb it was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance take away the stone he said but lord said Martha the sister of the Dead Man by this time there's a bad odor for he has been there four days then Jesus said did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God Jesus showed up to a funeral where there's a there's a crowd and many of them believe that his his power and his authority were both limited they said oh he could he healed the sick he he he could make the lame walk again he cast out demons but he could not keep his friend from dying and if that were true that would mean Jesus was not the Messiah he said he was the Bible says that Lazarus had been dead for four days that's significant because in the first century there was a superstitious belief among Judaism that a soul could return to a dead body within the first three days of death so they're doing the math and they're like one two three it's the fourth day it's too late can't come back but Jesus intentionally showed up on the fourth day when everybody said it was impossible when everybody said it was too late three days have already gone by he shows up on the fourth day he said take me to the tomb open the stone and they're like lord it's been four days he smells bad his body's already decaying God it's too late the first three days have passed Jesus said if they believe they would see a miracle Jesus says take me to the take me to the tomb take me where the dead things are roll the stone away man I believe there's some of us we've got dead dreams dead hopes dead marriages dead families on the inside of us that Jesus is standing there and he's saying roll the stone away and we're like God it's been 10 years God it's been 15 years it's been I prayed I fasted I served I get God I did everything I could do it looks bad it smells bad it's it's the it's impossible but what I love is that God is Not not intimidated by the dead things in our lives God is not limited by our circumstances verse 41 so they took away the stone then Jesus looked up and said father I thank you that you have heard me I knew that you always hear me but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe you sent me and when he had said this Jesus called with a loud voice Lazar laus come out and it says the dead man came out his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face and then Jesus said to them take off the grave clothes and let him go Jesus is staring at the dead things in your life today calling it back to life saying take off the dead clothes take off the grave clothes and get set him free let him go take the grave clothes off the dead marriage and set it free let it go take the dead grave clothes off of the marriage and let it be restored take the grave clothes off of the Dead hopes and the dead dreams and let it live again Church open up the stone to your heart let him call the dead things out and back to life he's more than a Healer he's more than a deliverer he's more than a provider he still raises dead things back to [Music] life it was an impossible situation that gave God the opportunity that gave Jesus the opportunity for the miracle they thought it was too late but with Jesus it's never too late for a miracle Ephesians 3: 20 it says now to him who's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think according to his power that works in [Music] us if you didn't get anything out of this message today take this with you I just want to challenge and encourage somebody God has not forgotten about you the dead things in your life he says no it's just asleep for a season I'm ready to wake it up just like he told Mary and Martha he said the sickness will not end in death what you're going through it's not going to end in defeat death does not have the final say your situation doesn't have the final say it will end with God's glory so that you may believe but what you have to do is you have to roll the stone away to your heart you have to let him in to touch the dead places and the dead things in your life you see when they rolled the stone away for Jesus to speak it was an Act of Faith because without faith it is impossible to please God is what scripture tells us it's never too late for a miracle it's never too late to stop out and receive what God has for you today would you open the stone would you let him call the dead thing back to life keep praying keep believing keep fasting keep loving keep forgiving keep serving keep making a difference today you have an opportunity to allow God to open up to open up your heart and allow God to resurrect whatever it is that you feel like has been dead in your life
pzfzA5BYCP4,wrapping up our series called throwback come on y'all enjoyed the throwback series and just bringing back some old school worship songs and looking into the lives of old testament heroes and so today we're going to conclude that next week we're starting speed kills men do not miss a series the lord has already been speaking to me and my life convicted me busy is breaking a lot of people's lives and it's hard to break the busy cycle and so i believe this series is going to be a blessing to so many people so this is another reason to be here all four weeks in the month of september but today as we wrap up the throwback series the title of my message today is pass the test pass the test how many of you when you hear the word test it gives you anxiety like how just that word it just makes you uncomfortable okay how many of you would say you hate tests you hated tests in school like you just despise tests yeah yeah my wife can relate to you my wife jamie she hates tests uh matter of fact in college we went to the same college together and jamie uh is studious she's smart and she is by far smarter than me and there were some times we had some classes together and a test was coming up and jamie would study for hours hours upon hours midnight 1 a.m study study study and get a c she'd be so mad and frustrated and what made it worse is i would study for 30 minutes and get an a y'all it did it caused some problems in our relationship she's like i can't stand you come home you can't stand those people like don't even have to study and get a good grade i know it's horrible i i can't explain to you why but hey 30 minutes i'd get it all in my memory and i would get good grades on uh my tests but our world it's filled with tests matter of fact when we moved back to indianapolis about seven or eight years ago uh ended up having a surprise test we were not expecting when we lived in oklahoma obviously our driver's license was with the state of oklahoma and when you move back to when you moved to indiana you have like 30 days or whatever to you know get an indiana license and so i'm thinking you know i'm just swapping in one license for another one but in the state of indiana for you to get an indiana driver's license they make you take the test over again i'm like man i pass this thing when i'm 16. you want me to pass it again like and so i'm in there and i just thought it would be a quick exchange and they're like here's a booklet do you want to study for the test i'm thinking to myself i mean i've been driving 20 plus years you know nah where's the test and so they sit you at the little you know you got your little chair and they got the they got the little blinders there right so nobody else can see so that if you fail you're not like shamed in front of the whole you know whoever's or i guess maybe so nobody cheats off your answers i don't know it's one or the other you know but i'm sitting there and and and the way the test works is um i can't remember the exact number let's say it was 25 questions and you had to get like 20 of them right if you missed more than five you fail you know and so i'm i'm like i got that man please i've been driving and so i'm going i'm like right right correct correct correct and then it was like wrong i was like oh all right that's no big deal it's just one wrong and then i'll do the next one wrong i'm like oh lord i only got three more wrongs and i got about 10 more i need to get right and i'm going correct correct correct i'm like okay i'm i think i got this correct wrong oh hold on yo i had to start praying i'm like all right jesus i'm like what are these questions anyway you know what i mean they're like if somebody's if there's a car wreck and somebody's like bleeding out and laying inside the car are you supposed to pull them out are you supposed to call 9-1-1 are you supposed to stay there or leave like all of them all is there all of the above like i don't you know what i mean and i don't know what i got that one wrong cause i was like call 9-1-1 i was like no you're supposed to pull them out i'm not going be pulling them out like i'm gonna pass out and be in the car as well with them like i don't but i made it i bet i got close y'all i think i only had one more wrong to spare but i got them all correct whoo praise the lord i did not fail the test i i'm curious how many of y'all failed the driver's to hey look hey she ain't no shame she just raised her last service people didn't want to raise their hand they're like man pastor why are you putting me on blast right here in front of everybody but uh tests they they're all over the place you have them in school you have them in work but y'all remember the mile test in high school it was cruel like why do i have to run a 10 minute mile explain to me what career and what occupation i'm gonna have to have i don't run y'all i got my treadmill with espn i'm like i gotta get tests they'll mess all kinds of tests and even our faith can be tested anybody's faith been tested i know i know mine has i'll be honest with you a year after being saved i've been i was saved a year and when i got saved i mean i was just on fire for g i was inviting everybody that people were avoiding me and they're like oh your crib's gonna invite me to church they were i was just hey i was just i was inviting everybody but after a year i got discouraged i started getting in my feelings didn't feel like i was making a difference i was going through some adversity i started to really question and doubt is this really worth it i've lost some friends had some people say some things about me and i kind of got in a dark place like i kind of hit i was really questioning my faith i was questioning whether i wanted to continue to be a christian is this really the life that the god or the the life that i should be living and so i really struggle i was at a point where my faith was really being tested and i questioned whether i should continue to live and and serve the lord and so today what i want to talk about is when our faith gets tested when we're faced with tests when we're faced with adversity when we're faced with threats how do we pass the test and so today we're going to look at the old testament hero daniel let me give you some background on daniel so daniel when you read the book of daniel you find daniel and he was a slave under the babylonians him and and and some of god's people had been captured they're slaves under the babylonians but daniel found favor with god he interpreted some dreams for the king he was actually promoted to third highest ruler in the kingdom and some folks did not like that they got jealous of daniel specifically there were some royal administrators some advisers some governors and they wanted to bring daniel down they were jealous they were hating on daniel and they convinced the king they're like how do we knock daniel down this dude is rising up in the ranks he's not even one of us how can we trap daniel and so they went to the king and they convinced the king to make a decree that for 30 days only the king would be worshipped and nothing else because they knew daniel was a man of god they knew he was a man of prayer he was a man of worship and if someone broke this law they had the king write out that that person must be thrown into the lion's den and if you know the story daniel he continued after this decree he continued to pray and worship and they knew this so the administrators the advisors the governors they they followed him and they caught him and they told on him and they went and told the key king king or somebody that is not following your decree what we do we do with them he says we need to throw them into the lion's den and so they went and they got daniel and they threw him into the lion's den and through daniel's story i want to share with you the three p's to pass the test the three p's the past the test the the first p is this is pursue his presence pursue his presence let's look at daniel chapter 6 verse 7 through 10. it says the royal administrators prefect sat raps advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next 30 days except to you your majesty shall be thrown into the lion's den it says now your majesty issues a decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered in accordance with the law of the medes and persians which cannot be repealed so king darius put the decree in writing now when daniel learned that the decree had been published he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward jerusalem three times a day he got on his knees and prayed giving thanks to his god just as he had done before when daniel learned of the decree he immediately went to his father he immediately pursued god's presence he immediately went to his home got on his knees and put himself in god's presence see as soon as i would have heard that i'm going to get thrown in a lion's den for not praying to the king i don't know about i'm looking for another king to serve i'm like hey y'all what what what's what what donkey's getting out of here the fastest you know what i mean like how do we get up i'm getting out of dodge i might be thinking maybe i need god i'm just gonna go serve you somewhere else for 30 days then you may even be thinking okay i need to quit like this this god thing isn't quite work i didn't sign up to get eaten by a lion hey god listen god i know you know my heart right listen i just got to take a break for 30 days okay 30 days i love you i promise you i'll be back in 30 days but daniel doesn't do either of these things he continues to pursue god like he was before the test before the problem came see oftentimes when persecution tests adversity threats come people may pursue addictions some may be looking to get drunk that's what i did in high school before christ when i was in high school if i had a bad day my answer my solution was simple it was to get drunk bad day equaled going and drinking others they may look to drugs or others may look to addictions like comfort eating or gambling or burying ourselves in work to release the stress or to get away from the problems and listen those things may appear that they can help and cover and protect but here's the thing they all will fade away they don't purpo they don't permanently remove it only god does only god does some it may not be an addiction they may just be pursuing hobbies or money or lifting weights or playing basketball or going shopping or to get their mind off the problem some may watch netflix or camp out on tick tock or social media and hear me i'm not saying any of those things are wrong or bad but the issue is oftentimes when there's a test or a threat we go everywhere and anywhere and we forget the one source that can bring true victory rest and peace which is god and the same can happen when our faith is tested we may start to retreat turn down our passion for god worship less pray less we start being tested so we stop serving stop attending a small group or or leading a small group we feel like man i need to lay low spiritually and i want us to learn from daniel that god does not want us to lay low he wants us to do the opposite we should not turn down our passion for god we should turn up our passion for god come on turn up for jesus what do i mean by that worship more pray more serve more never miss out on church come on the perfect time if you're going through a test and some adversity sign up for that four week challenge so you're in god's house every single week we gotta press into his presence not push away press into his presence not pull away from it because there is peace and there is safety in his presence proverbs 18 10 it says the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and are safe god is our strong tower god is our protector god is the miracle worker what did daniel do when the threat and the test came he ran to his father and we have to do the exact same i think about my children when they're little and they're scared or there's a threat or something what do they do they run to their father they'll run into my arms or they'll run into my rooms daniel knew this too he ran to his father and so when you face a test persecution listen especially for your faith don't hold back don't turn it down come on turn it up run to your father run to his presence pursue his presence because his presence gives peace in the face of persecution and so we have to pursue his presence here's the second p to pass the test is is pray to god for protection pray to god for protection the decree has been made and daniel not only ran to his father but but look what the bible says in daniel chapter 6 11. it says then these men went as a group and they found daniel praying and asking god for help when the decree was made daniel knew his life was in danger because he wasn't going to worship the king so he immediately he ran to his father he went to his room and he asked god for help notice he doesn't go negotiate with the king i mean he had a place that he could have talked to the king he had favor with the king he could have knocked on the king door say listen can you let me tell you why these guys did this no no he didn't negotiate with the king he didn't run to his friends he didn't take matters into his own hands instead he went to his room and prayed he he looked to god and prayed first see the problem is sometimes god is the last source we ask for protection we'll ask family we'll ask friends we'll ask a boyfriend we'll ask a girlfriend we'll ask a husband we'll ask a wife come on i've been there jamie help me and listen i'm not saying those people are wrong maybe you ask a co-worker a boss some of us we go post social media we get a thousand different opinions and listen some of those things can be good but none of those things can literally calm a storm only god can none of those people can perform a miracle none of those people can shut a lion's mouth only god can so pray for protection first not last ask god for protection ask your father for help listen don't make the mistake of not asking in james 4 2 the back part of that verse it says you do not have because you do not ask god we'll ask everybody and anybody but god matthew chapter 7 verse 7 through 11 it says ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks the door will be opened which of you if your son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish we'll give him a snake if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him ask seek knock pray for protection listen when you pray for protection sometimes prayer will take it away sometimes prayer can make a way sometimes prayer can take a lion's hunger away and daniel said amen and thank you lord for that listen i don't know what god is going to do i just know that god can do what i can't do and i'm gonna pray and ask for his protection and whether he takes it away whether he makes a way through it or whether he literally takes a lion's hunger away i know he's all-powerful not me he's all-knowing not me he does miracle not me listen y'all i pray protection over my family all the time like man pastor chris you're getting tests and threats and adversity not like that not all the time but sometimes but i'm a preventative prayer y'all come on i'm gonna pray i'm i'm praying preventative prayers over my family why not because i know the devil is out like a roaring lion looking for somebody to come on i'm praying i'm talking to my god that can call on a legion of angels to come and put them around to my children and my family and situations listen when stuff comes absolutely but i'm praying in advance and daniel he was protected because he prayed to god for protection so you got to pursue his presence you gotta pray for protection and then the third p is this persevere you gotta persevere if you don't know the story those men told on daniel the king said throw him into the lion's den and so they went they grabbed daniel and threw him into the lion's den let's look at daniel chapter 6 verse 23 it says the king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift daniel out of the dead and when daniel was lifted from the den the bible says no wound was found on him because he had trusted in his god he obeyed god and he look he asked god for help and yet he still was put into the lion's den and at this point man his faith his trust in god was put into practice and it says no wound was found on him because he had trusted in his god i don't know about you i would have preferred not to be put into the lion's den you know what i mean i would have preferred i would have preferred god to do something else you know what i mean i i would have preferred god maybe to just reign fire down from heaven and burn up the lion and you know give me some lion steak you know what i mean like or or just burn up the king like i would not have preferred to go into the lion's den i would be like all right lord i know they want to put me in there but hey you're my god so where's my hammock and my lemonade lord where are you gonna do what you need to do because i know i don't need to go in to the den with the lion i mean i i would have been god i've lived for you i mean i would have been talking to god a little bit like god three times a day i mean i come to you i pray remember when they wanted me to eat that mess and i'm like no i'm not gonna eat that mess let me eat this food over here and i'll still be god i have faithfully served you there is absolutely no reason i need to go into that den with that lion and daniel still had to face the lion see sometimes in life we can pray and live for god but we're still going to be put in the lion's den and our faith is tested and we have to trust god to protect us it says no wound was found on him because he had trusted in god daniel had what i call a stand firm trust he didn't run he went into that lion's den and he stood firm and he trusted god in the face of adversity and god wants us to have the same trust and perseverance listen we gotta persevere to pass the test and threat and adversity that may be in front of us and this is why over and over again in the bible god says and tells us to stand firm let me just show you let me just give you some verses old testament to new testament exodus 14 13 moses answered the people do not be afraid stand firm and you will see the deliverance the lord will bring to you today the egyptians you see today you will never see again second chronicles 2017 you will not have to fight this battle take up your positions stand firm and see the deliverance the lord will give you judah and jerusalem psalm 20 verse 8 they are brought to their knees and fall but we rise up and stand firm proverbs 10 25 when the storm has swept by the wicked are gone but the righteous stand firm forever proverbs 12 7 the wicked are overthrown and no more but the house of the righteous stands firm matthew 10 22 you will be hated by everyone because of me but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved luke 21 19 stand firm and you will win life first corinthians 15 58 therefore my dear brothers and sisters stand firm let nothing move you always give yourselves fully to the work of the lord because you know that your labor in the lord is not in vain first corinthians 16 13 be on your guard stand firm in the faith be courageous be strong second corinthians 1 24 not that we see it lord over your faith but we work with you for your joy because it is by faith you stand firm galatians 5 1 it is for freedom that christ has set you free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by the yoke of slavery ephesians 6 14 stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist with the breastplate of righteousness in place philippians 4 1 therefore my brothers and sisters who i love and long for my joy and crown stand firm in the lord in this way dear friends first thessalonians 3 8 for now we really live since you are standing firm in the lord first thessalonians 2 15 so then brothers and sisters stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you and james 5 8 you too be patient and stand firm because the lord's coming is near over and over and over again god is telling us oh if you will stand firm if you will persevere i'm telling you there's victory there's breakthrough you will pass the test so many times in the bible it says stand firm because there are many times we're gonna have to face the problem face to test face the threat face the adversity face the persecution god didn't take away the giant david had to face him god didn't wipe out pharaoh moses had to go to him nehemiah had to stand firm against threats jedrach meshach and abednego had to stand firm and go into the fire paul stood firm and was beaten and flogged and put in jail and daniel had to stand firm and the lion didn't disappear y'all the lion was in there with them he spent all night face to face with the lion but he never caved in he never gave in he never said i'll reject my god and i'll bow down to you king listen don't cave in it's not always going to be easy but if you will stand firm then i'm telling you you'll see god do amazing in your life we can live for god pray every day and still have people attack us we can live for god pray every day and still come face to face with a trial or threat where our faith is tested but if we will stand firm hold on to our faith we serve a faithful god who will help us pass the test and overcome all adversity pastor chris how did you overcome listen i'm telling you a year after being saved my faith got really really shaky i had to stand firm not stand up my feelings not stand in my thoughts i had to stand firm on his word i had to press in i had to turn up i could not turn down i had to pray more worship more get in church more i started serving more and all throughout my life my faith my life's been tested there's been challenges whether it's through family my marriage in the workplace and i've just chosen listen when when that happens i have to turn up you may be thinking pastor what do i have to do to pass this test this adversity this struggle you got to turn up turn up the prayer turn up the worship be in church every single week sign up for the four week challenge come on turn up in your word turn up and lead a small group if you aren't serving you need to turn up and start serving on the dream team but pastor i'm facing some challenges this isn't a good time to serve you're right it's the perfect time for you to serve and to step up and turn up i promise you if you will stand firm matter of fact for the four week challenge we need more dream team to serve people all four weeks listen would you stand firm would you sign up would you turn up your serve and serve for those four days because you know what happens when you pass the test promotion god wants to promote you but you got to pass the test look at daniel look what happened daniel 6 24-28 it says at the king's command the men who had falsely accused daniel were brought in and thrown into the lion's den along with their wives and children and before they reached the floor of the den the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones it says then king darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language and all the earth may you prosper greatly he said i issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the god of daniel for he is the living god and he endures forever his kingdom will not be destroyed his dominion will never end he rescues and he saves he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth he rescued daniel from the power of lions so daniel prospered during the reign of darius and the reign of cyrus the persian listing passing the test always leads to promotion because adversity leads to opportunity listen i don't like tests just like you don't like them but i know on the other side of a test there's a promotion that god's making me stronger if i'll pursue his presence if i'll pray for protection and if i will persevere and stand firm there's a breakthrough on the other side of that test there's prosperity on the other side of that test there's glory to be given only to god on the other side of that test and so no matter what test you're facing stand firm stand firm god is with you our faith sometimes is all we have to hold on to stand firm and hold on to your faith and i'm telling you when you do that i tell you throughout my life i faced tests threats adversity challenges every time i've been able to stand firm there's been a promotion there's been a blessing there's been a breakthrough every time i've gotten stronger every time i've gotten wiser every time i've it's helped me become more humble and i'm just telling you whatever you're facing god is with you and if you'll trust him if you'll pursue his presence pray for protection if you'll persevere you will see god get you
Skeg1-mFBmM,and today we're starting a new series I'm excited about this series I really believe it's going to be um it's going to be so life-changing for so many people in 2024 it's called Uh own it it we'll be doing this series all the way through uh the four-week challenge and and and and maybe even uh Beyond but it's all about breaking free from excuses Breaking Free from excuses and the title of my message today is I will own my life I will own my my life I I've shared this story before I want to share it again but with a a bit of a different angle and it was from when I was in college uh Sundays were very uh easy for me especially during the fall you know wake up go to church come back to the dorm watch the Colts uh it was in Missouri so they were on Central time so I got to watch the Colts at noon and then I took a nap that's just what I did every Sunday and so one Sunday the the Colts must have lost because I was in a little bit of a funk because when I was getting ready to take my nap some some of my roommates came over and they were like hey man um one of our teachers uh she's a she's a widow and they're like she needs some yard work done at your house and I'm going to be honest with you I wasn't feeling very uh uh Godly in that moment I was like I guess you do her own yard work you know what I mean like right we got to go do her you know I mean y'all got enough people you do you really need me you know what I mean sorry but anyway I I was like man I felt convicted and so I was like all right yeah I'll go help and um and so we we drive over to her house and y'all the front yard we pull up and I'm like oh my goodness the grass was like up to like knee level like I didn't I didn't know grass could grow up to knee level you know what I mean and so I'm looking at the front yard I'm like oh my goodness and then we go into the backyard and it is like the Amazon rainforest no joke grass and weeds up to my waist and higher I mean we're peeling through her backyard like this it was so high we're walking through her backyard and Bam hit our she had a fountain that we couldn't even see because I'm like what and then it Dawns on me she has two students in college that live at home so I start asking questions I'm like don't her kids hey don't were her kids and they weren't even there to help I'm like what about her kids and they're like oh well you know you know that's you know yard work's not really their thing and they've been kind of busy and you know it's just kind of been a rough year on them and all I'm hearing is I'm just hearing EXC excuses I'm like well man I'm busy you know what I mean I got some stuff going on I about ready think of reasons why I got to I got to I'm looking at this mess and and and here's the deal here's what I know excuses we not going to get her yard cleaned up excuses we're not going to cut that grass excuses were not going to clean out that Fountain excuses were not going to pull all those five foot weeds and everything else excuses we're not going to get anything done matter of fact excuses are the reason Reon why that house just got so that that that that yard and the house and everything just got so crazy and so we busted out the lawnmowers I think we had a couple machetes I mean we we we needed like okay we about to go to work and we we got her yard completely fixed up taken care of she was she she was so blessed by it but you know here's what I've learned success and excuses don't live together in the same house that house got cray cray because of excuses and it's true for all of us if you want to live a life of excess excuses have to leave the house and if you want to live a life of excuses success will leave the house success and excuses don't live together in the same house Jim Rome said this Jim not Jim Rome Jim ran with an N he said this excuses are the nails used to build houses of failure excuses are the nails used to build houses of failure and it when it comes to your life are you building a house of failure because you're using the nails of excuses see all of us are building houses we're building a friendship house a Financial house we're building an educational house a a career house we're building a physical health and mental health and emotional health house and some of your houses may look like my professor's house as we begin another New Year some of you are reflecting on how your 2023 went and as you look back you see broken relationships no peace Financial disarray regret threats guilt shame disappointment frustration and defeat you look back and you

things always be this bad can you ever accomplish your goals and see success rather than failure listen there really is hope for you in 2024 you don't have to keep building a house of failure with the nails of excuses you can break free from the horrible habit of excuses and you can begin to own your life own your decisions on your finances on your relationships and on your spiritual life see excuses today make sure your life is the same as it was yesterday excuses are nothing more than a self-imposed roadblock and some of you you you are your worst enemy you keep blocking your success with excuses it's a self-imposed road block Benjamin Franklin said this he that is good at making excuses is seldom good for anything else excuses they are a self-imposed roadblock George Washington Carver said 99% of failures come from people who have the habit of making excuses we have to break the habit of excuses so that we can start owning our life and building houses of success and listen it's not an easy habit to break making excuses has been a struggle from the very beginning the first humans Adam and Eve they disobeyed God sin entered the world and one of the first things we see Adam and Eve do is make excuses look at Genesis 3: 11-13 God said who told you that you were naked have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from the answer should have been yes Lord I disobeyed you I'm sorry but the man said the woman you put here with me she gave me the fruit from that tree and I ate it he blaming God and the woman okay Adam then the Lord said to the woman what is this you have done she should have said I disobeyed you I'm sorry but the woman said the serpent deceived me and I ate When sin entered the world so did excuses it's the woman's fault it's the Serpent's fault God you put her down here this was the moment Humanity started to build houses of failure with nails of excuses and it continues to this very day it's not my fault it's my parents' fault it's my childhood it's my friend's fault it's my job it's my co-workers it's my boss's fault it's my teacher's fault it's my school it's the economy it's my enemy it's problems it's personality it's my spouse it's my ex it's my skin color it's my hair I'm Too Tall I'm too short excuses self-imposed roadblocks and the raw reality is there are some situations you find yourself in that aren't your fault someone did something to you there were circumstances that happened outside of your control it's unfair what happened to you but listen the only way you can move forward is to overcome all excuses and start owning where you are start start owning your decisions to move forward in life start owning what you can control taking ownership of your life and your decisions is a Biblical principle it's easily overlooked and under practice but it's a very important biblical principle look at Matthew 11:12 it says from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force you you have to take some things by force you have to own it Philippians 4:13 it says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me listen God will strengthen you okay but you have to do the all things part you have to own it Philippians 2:12 it says so then my beloved just as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your salvation with fear fear and trembling now now let me explain this what what this verse means here this is not talking about working for your salvation okay I'm not even talking about working on your salvation you can't do anything to finish or make your salvation more complete Jesus did it all all right when he said it is finished that's what he meant the price has been paid once and for all for your salvation our Salvation can only be found in the finished work of Christ so we don't work to get saved but Paul is saying we do work because we are saved God has called us to work out what he has worked in us he's called us to work out what he has worked in US you have to own your salvation that God has freely given you and then you have to work out your your salvation with fear and trembling you got to work it out with your family work it out in your career in education work it out with your finances work it out with your health work it out with your friends you are called by God to work it out come on look at your neighbor just tell him work it out work it out work it out we can make that a song y'all I don't know somebody work it out but work it out for Jesus okay something there somebody else can finish it but listen you don't work to get saved but you do work it out because you are saved and to work it out means you have to move past your excuses you have to own it in 2024 we're going to stop building houses of failure with the nails of excuses you're going to work it out own your own life and work it out own your relationships and work it out own your problems and work it out on your future and work it out in life you can have excuses or you can have success but you can't have both you can't have both and so I want to share with you three common excuses that'll keep from owning it three common excuses that'll keep from owning it and we're going to be looking at Philippians chap 2: 12-15 the the first Common excuse is this is complaining complaining Philippians 2:14 the Bible says do everything without [Music] complaining Lord getting in my grill a little bit do everything see some of you are building a house of fair failure with the nails of complaining complaining is when you spend your time expressing your dissatisfaction your sadness discontentment frustration with where you are and what's in front of you and the greatest lie of complaining is people think it helps their life people think complaining will somehow lead to change in their circumstances or their life but complaining it's a self-imposed roadblock it's stop owning where you are it stops you from changing your life and your circumstances that's why Paul says work out your salvation with fear and trembling and do everything without complaining because complaining about it won't change anything it actually makes things worse you're complaining about your kids and it's not making it any better you're complaining about your marriage is not making it any better you're complaining about your job your money your teacher at school the economy and it's not making anything better often times it's making it worse and so ask yourself am I spending my time complaining or am I owning where I am and doing something about it to experience success in 2024 you got to stop complaining and start owning where you are Rick Warren said you are not a victim of your circumstances you are a child of God with the power to change them stop complaining and start claiming the promises of God for your life woo that's a word y'all [Music] rewind let me say it again you are not a victim of your circumstances you are a child of God with the power to change them stop complaining and start claiming the promises of God for your life stop complaining and work out your salvation with fear and trembling number two second common excuse is arguing Philippians 2:14 2114 do everything without complaining and arguing some of you you are building a house of failure with nails of arguing you aren't seeing changes and success because you're spending all your time arguing about where you are in life you're arguing with God you're arguing with friends friends family with co-workers some of you you are professional arguers you are a professional at debating now don't Point come on don't Point don't side eye anybody areas of your life are in shambles and all you doing is arguing with everybody you're defensive you built walls around you you're keeping people out you're keeping wisdom out and you're keeping change out arguing it's a self-imposed roadblocks it blinds you from seeing the reality of where you are and it causes you to push relationships and other opportunities out of your life someone once said I'm not arguing I'm just explaining why I'm right and that's your problem you're always right you just argue your perspective someone else once said it's important to know when to stop arguing with people and just let them be wrong hear me today it's a bad place to be when wise people around you just keep quiet and they let you keep building a house of failure with nails of arguing you have to stop arguing and start working out your salvation with fear and trembling and then number three is blaming some of you you're you're building a house of failure with nails of blaming see you can either spend your time blaming or you can spend your time becoming blameless Philippians chapter 2:15 it says so that you may become blameless and pure children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as Christ's followers we're supposed to strive to be blameless not blame others see blaming is one of the most destructive habits that will keep you from owning it it's a self-imposed roadblock that will keep you from working out your salvation with fear and trembling blaming it relieves you from all responsibilities instead you're spending all your energy putting responsibility on someone or something else and when you do this you give the person or the circumstance power over your life you literally Rend yourself powerless and some of you you've lost control of your life because you're spending your energy blaming people or circumstances you become a victim you believe you can't change and do better in life because of what they did or what they said it's your parents' fault why you can't be successful in life it's your spouse's fault it's your crazy upbringing it's the neighborhood you live in it's where you work it's your kids' fault it's your lack of opportunities it's your unique set of circumstances it's those people's fault why you can't be successful in 2024 and as your pastor listen I love you and I want to speak the truth to your heart today you have to stop putting your future in someone else's hands listen today you have to start owning where you are so that you can change where you are the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force you have to own it you can do all things through Christ who gives you strength you have to own it you can work out your salvation with fear and trembling I want to close with a story about a teacher in the Bronx she had a classroom of students that she wanted to see reach their full potential but nearly all of them were held back by years of making making excuses blaming and choosing not to own what they could own she had them right down on little pieces of paper all of the IE can'ts I can't get a good grade I can't get a job I can't go to college she then put them in a shoe box and they went outside on the playground and she talked to them how most of what they wrote down was not an I can't but an I won't she then lit the Box on fire and she had them go back inside and began to write what they could do and what they would do more of them graduated and went on the college than any other class because they owned it I at graduation one student said it was the moment that I burned my excuses and decided to own it that made all the difference she told them stop making excuses stop complaining stop blaming and they owned it listen I got a shoe box up here and we got some eye can'ts that we need to put in this shoe box and we need to burn it we need to bury it there's some of you today you're believing the LIE of the enemy I can't be successful and listen you got all the excuses all the re come on today in 2024 let's put it into the shoe box some of you today you feel like I can't overcome depression and anxiety I've tried there's just no way there's just no help come on today let's let's let's put it in the shoe box let let's light it on fire let's burn up the I can't some of you today believe you can't have a happy marriage I want you to know that you can with Jesus you can come on would you would you put it into the shoe box some of you today you believe the lie that I can't serve the Lord I'm too messed up jacked up made too many mistakes I don't have time there's no way God would want to use me come on would you take the I can't and put it in the shoe box some of you today you believe I can't break free from the addiction you've been addicted for years or months or 10 20 plus years and I've tried and it doesn't work come on today today today 2024 would you put the Ians in The Shoe Box some of you believe I can't lose weight listen you can you can do it come on would you take the I can't and would you put it in the shoe box some of you believe I I I can't get out of debt you're looking at all your debt and your bills and you're looking at the income you're just say I just can't I don't see a way and you can find excuse after excuse you don't even want to look at at your at your bank statement anymore but come on in 2024 would you take the I can't and would you put it in the shoe box some of you believe I I I can't have good relationships come on would you believe you can and would you put it in the shoe box some man I can't attend church every sun it's just too hard every Sunday 52 weeks I just I and you got to get find all the excuse come on would you own it you can you can would you put it in the shoe box and there's many of us in this room we have I can that the enemy has been telling us over and over again trying to fill our minds with these lies and I'm here to tell you today with Jesus you can would you take every single one of your eye can'ts would you put it in the shoe box and come on we're going to light it on fire we're going to burn it we're going to bury it in 2024 because with God you can you can do all things but you got to own it you got to own it you got to own it you got to own it and say yes I can yes I will and you got to start writing out your I can and I Wills and I'm telling you you will see God do immeasurably more in your life than you could ever ask or imagine if you get rid of the excuses own it and say I can I can I can let's pray if you'll bow your heads and close your eyes
wQWIEii6sm4,well the title of my message today is the best day ever The Best Day Ever you know the last nine months we've had some pretty significant milestones in our family in the Smith family last fall my oldest began his freshman year in high school and then my middle child my daughter started her first year in middle school it's like oh I got a high schooler and a middle schooler now this is going too fast matter of fact someone's like you only have three more Spring Breaks with your oldest child oh I'm not oh I don't know if I'm ready for that and so these there might have been some tears shed this past fall and so it was a big deal uh and then also Jamie and I we have this year we have been on staff at People's Church for 15 years 15 years I'm like man I was 27 when I came on staff and now I'm 42 years old and having these Milestones has really caused me just to reflect over my 42 years of life and as I look over the last 42 years of my life you know what there's been some difficult days there have been some challenging days and years some tough days and years I remember when I was 26 years old I injured my lower back and it was such a significant injury that I could not stand for longer than five minutes without radiating pain down my back through my legs so I was a youth pastor at this time I couldn't even preach standing I had to preach sitting on a stool and so it was a really difficult and tough year with physical therapy and and trying to get my back better those are some tough days Jamie and I after being married seven years hit a rough spot in our marriage matter of fact we hit a rock bottom where we even mentioned the word divorce and we had to get some counseling and some things had to change in our marriage and those were some difficult days throughout my life I've battled anxiety there's been a number of days I've had panic attacks and those just weren't fun those were challenging they were tough they were difficult and so as I look back on 42 years man there have been some challenging there's been some difficult days but you know what there's also been some amazing days and matter of fact when I started thinking back on just some of the best days of my life I want to share some of those with you one of the best days of my life was when I graduated college it's a picture of my college graduation I'm there with my brother my sister and my my niece and high school I didn't I didn't do so well my grades weren't too good but college man I buckled down I worked really really hard I made the best grades and I remember that just being a special day all that hard work and and and paying off and that that was one of the best days uh one of the best days of my life was also when I got married to my bride got a picture from our wedding day come on young love we were that was 18 years ago we're about to celebrate 19 years of marriage uh in May and that was just one of the best days of my life let me give you another incredible day you can show the next picture this was my first full-time Ministry position I was a youth pastor in Columbus Ohio and so Jamie and I are there with our youth group at summer camp and that was a pretty special day when I became the youth pastor at that church uh three really really important days of my life some of the best days of my life when all three of my children were born and so I told you my oldest is in high school but here's his baby picture there's little Jace just a few hours after being born and and then we got our Cali girl after she was born and she is again now 12 so that's 12 years ago and then we got our little guy Cohen he's for um but man those were three of the best days of my life life let me give you another one of the best days of my life it was in 2006 when the Indianapolis Colts won the Super Bowl y'all oh yeah hey not everybody gets to watch their favorite team win a Super Bowl so I don't take it for granted it was the first and I hope it's not the last I hope I get to see another Colts Super Bowl win and many more Lord help us get a quarterback so I give them wisdom Lord so that was one of the best days another incredible day in our life was when we started People's Church Indianapolis back in 2015 August 16th we had grand opening at a Fall Creek Valley Middle School and God has just done something so amazing here but that is a day that Jamie and I will never forget another uh incredible day was a family vacation when we went to Disney World and so here we are at the animal Kingdom and it actually is our whole family Jamie was pregnant with Cohen so praise the Lord Cohen's been to Disney World we don't have to worry about taking them but uh no the whole family went and that was just a special time it was fun memories it was a magical day at uh Disney and then lastly two very special days that I'll never forget was when I got to baptize my son Jace and I also got to baptize my daughter Cali those are just two special days I've had some great days in my 42 years of life but nothing compares to the day I accepted the gift of Jesus as my savior making Jesus my Lord and Savior is by far the the that is the best day I've ever had the best day and I know it could be easier for you to think what is what you're supposed to say you're the pastor it's Easter you're supposed but I promise you it was no no it was the best day ever and I want to share with you why why it was the best day ever in my life number one is this it was my best day ever because my sins were forgiven before I met Jesus I was a hot mess see there's a mess and then there's a hot mess okay I was on the hot mess Express stealing lying stuck in sexual sand looking at porn drinking getting drunk I mean I was a hot mess Express and because I grew up in church I remember feeling you know some guilt and some condemnation I remember being forced to come to church and feeling like Unworthy of God's love there's no way God would love me there's no way God forgive me matter of fact when I got my car when I was 16 years old I stopped going to church all together I wanted nothing to do at church and I wanted nothing to do with God I was living my own way I was doing my own thing I had no desire to go to church and when I was 18 my senior year in high school I liked a girl and uh that girl's dad said we couldn't date unless I went to church and I'm like well all right I guess I'll go back to church but y'all I wasn't worshiping I was acting a fool I was in church I was acting a fool this is fake these people are weird I was making fun of everybody but you know what I kept going I kept going I kept going I kept going and it took about a year I was a little hard-headed but it took about a year and I promise you you stay in church long enough God will get you I stayed in here a year and God got a hold of my heart he saved me and it changed my life I'll never forget the day I gave my life to Jesus the burden that was lifted the freedom that I felt the weight that was lifted the condemnation was gone we're going to be studying Romans 8 today and it says in Romans 8 1-2 so now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus I'll never forget that condemnation being lifted and being gone I'll never forget four months later signing up to get water baptized I'll never forget that day I'll never forget being nervous but at the same time being so thankful I'll never forget getting in that water and the tears just flowing of just thinking about how God changed me and how he saved me and he forgave me of all my sins and how he turned my life around it's a moment I'll never ever forget it was it was so amazing going in the water and coming up and listen when your sins are forgiven and the shame the guilt the condemnation is lifted off your life you want to tell everybody that you belong to Jesus there's an excitement about getting water baptized I invited everybody to my invited teachers friends family everybody I invited to my water baptism and you know you see this over and over again in the Bible where people gave their life to Christ and immediately got water baptized Acts chapter 2 verse 41 it says those who accepted his message were baptized acts 8 38 and he gave orders to stop the Chariot then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him acts 16 33 at that hour of the night the Jailer took them and washed their wounds then immediately he and all his household were baptized acts 22 16 and now what are you waiting for or get up be baptized and wash your sins away there's something powerful about your sins being forgiven and then getting water baptized matter of fact seven weeks ago we baptized a ton of people and I was so fired up so blessed by their stories and their testimonies I want to share them with you today check out this video grief despair honestly um I was trying everything to crawl up out of that my lowest point was just realizing that I didn't really love myself um when I looked in the mirror I just saw someone that was empty and I didn't like that but I got baptized back in the 90s and I think I did it for all the wrong reasons and whenever Pastor Herbert did the um turn your life over to Jesus prayer I raised my hand so I figured it was time to get a water baptism and take it to the next level this time is the last time this time I am not turning my back on God and this time I'm doing it for life my heart never beat like it did whenever I sat down and I felt it felt like it was going to jump out of my chest and just run off and whenever I came back up the beating was gone it was like total calmness I just felt this Joy yes I'm doing this yes I'm this is my commitment God yes I am doing this and I'm keeping my promise I just feel relieved um like definitely a way it's been taken off my heart I feel like I'm ready to start this New Journey with God and I'm excited [Music] come on so powerful can we give thanks to God today you can give your life to Christ and next Sunday you can get baptized in water God created you for both of those things to be saved and to be baptized and it's an incredible incredible experience and step in your faith Journey number two it was my best day ever because I now had the power to overcome sin see before I gave my life to Christ I thought I was a slave to sin I was a slave to sexual sin to lying a slave to uncontrolled anger and bitterness I just thought that's the way it was it was it was normal to me I didn't see a way out I didn't know that I could be set free of of that of that lifestyle but listen when I gave my life to Jesus man something changed God changed something in me I matter of fact I'll never forget after I gave my life to Christ I was driving and in my car but my one of my CDs were playing I remember just the the inappropriate music I literally ejected it and I threw it out of my vehicle I then went home and took all my inappropriate CDs I threw them in the trash I took all my inappropriate vhs's and I threw those in the trash I had alcohol hidden in my closet I went and grabbed it all and I poured it all down the sink listen I didn't do that because I had to I did that because I wanted to God had changed me and changed my life and I'm like I don't need these things in my life anymore and so I got rid of all of them but let me explain what happened happened to me from the Bible look at Romans chapter 8 verse 2 through 4. it says and because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death the law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature so God did what the law could not do he sent his own son in a body like the bodies we Sinners have and in that body God declared an end to sin's control over Us by giving his son as a sacrifice for our sins he did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the spirit when I gave my life to Jesus the Holy Spirit came to live inside of me and gave me the power and the desire to change the incredible news is that the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of every person who gives their life to Jesus us and the Holy Spirit is a game changer see some of you you thought the the Keurig or the K-Cup was a game changer you're like oh my goodness one cup of coffee some of y'all you thought two ply toilet paper was a game changer like thank you Jesus some of y'all you thought the smartphone was a game changer some of you you thought these two words Amazon Prime was a game changer some of y'all think getting your groceries ordered online and delivered to your house was a game changer oh no no let me tell you the holy spirit is the game changer he's the game changer and listen I am no longer fighting sin on my own the holy spirit is in me and it has changed my life it's a game changer it's a game changer third reason it was my best day ever it was my best day ever because of all the the blessings that followed salvation since I've given my life to Jesus 25 years ago God has given me so many blessings matter of fact the Bible talks about some of the blessings every Christian receives in Romans 8. look at Romans 8 23 it says and we Believers also groan even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as as a foretaste of future glory for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering we too wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children including the new bodies he has promised us come on who's excited about your new body in heaven my six-pack and a full head of hair thank you Jesus when someone prays the prayer and gives their life to Jesus they are immediately adopted into God's family when I gave my life to Christ I became God's child not just David and Carolyn Smith's child I was now God's child and there are benefits we receive when we become God's children just like my kids get benefits for being my children we're going to have an Easter celebration and then we're going to bless them with some ice cream today because they're my children and my children I make sure they have a roof over the head and clothes on their back and food in their belly and and there's benefits and and I've received so many blessings since becoming a child of God let me show you some of the blessings right out of Romans 8 Romans 8 23 and 25 it talks about the hope of Heaven Come on this Earth is not my final home Heaven is and I can't wait for heaven no more pain suffering murder rape racism no more hatred lying cheating corruption sickness and death I can't wait for heaven Romans 8 26 it talks about how the Holy Spirit helps me in my weakness there's so many times the Holy Spirit has helped me in verse 26 talks about how the Holy Spirit helps me pray sometimes I don't know what to pray and the Holy Spirit helps me Romans 8 28 it says God works all things for my good he has taken the Bad and the good and he works them for my good in Romans 8 29 it says God is making me more like his son Jesus Through the Holy Spirit through the word of God through prayer and through the church God is making me more and more like Jesus and listen I don't want it just to be your best day ever I want you to have your best year ever and how you have your best year average you got to run the spiritual play if you've ever been on a sports team basketball team football team they got plays to win the game God has spiritual place for you to run and if you will run those plays you'll have your best year ever if you seek God first you'll have your best year ever and so I want to give you a spiritual play to run for this whole year for one year run the spiritual play Faithfully pray and read God's word Worship in God's house Faithfully give your life away by serving others Faithfully grow closer to God and others by attending a small group Faithfully if you will run this spiritual play every day for this entire year you will have your best year ever Romans 8 30 it says God has called me he's Justified me he's glorified me God's called me I have purpose because of God Romans 8 31 it says if God is for me who can be against me nothing I face in life is bigger and better than my God in Romans 8 32 it says God gives me everything that I need God has blessed this city boy from Indianapolis he's blessed me with my wife and with my kids and with my home and my car and food and clothes he's blessed me with People's Church he's blessed me to impact lives Romans 8 34 it says Jesus is praying for me Romans 8 37 it says in all things I am more than a conqueror I'm more than a conqueror I'm a winner I am victorious in Romans 8 35 and verses 38 and 39 it says nothing will separate me from God's love not trouble hardship persecution famine nakedness danger or sword not death nor life neither angels nor demons not fear worry not even the powers of hell can separate me from God's love God loves me and God loves you no matter what you've done even if you don't believe in Jesus God loves you he loves you right where you are God loves you God loves you God loves you we're going to hear some testimonies from people changed by the love of God these are not actors these are real

know where else you're going to be suffering in hell if you don't get your butt in church right so it's just like you know it never it just had to go right that was the family I grew up in we went to church every Sunday morning back then we had Sunday night services we had Wednesday night services we had Thursday night prayer meetings or Bible studies and then if we had a special speaker coming through town that decided wanted to be there three four nights in a row we were there for all those Services too we were in church all the time as I became a teenager that discipline of going to church put me into the youth ministry at our local church where I would hear the youth pastor preach sermons that if I'm being honest sometimes made me squirm in my seat and one of those sermons he was talking about sharing our faith with others and he tells this story and he says there was this guy who was gripped by the fact that so many people in his high school were lost and did not know Jesus and so feeling bolded by the spirit he stood up on his chair in his cafeteria and he started preaching to the entire School in the cafeteria and he won Them All to Jesus and it was a great Revival and he's like and God might be calling you to do that and I was like bro I go to Warren Central High School I ain't staying on no chair in my cafeteria I would rather die I ain't doing that right and like that's just like I hear these stories of like people that are just bold like that but I got to be honest with you I was so uncomfortable sharing my faith I would like go out of my way to avoid it right like and I got to be I didn't have great examples either I remember one time our church there was you know sometimes when churches are small and they're trying to grow they just do anything to reach people for Jesus right and like listen we don't care what you know just go for it and so one time they're like we're going to go to Broad Ripple we're just going to reach people for Jesus and this guy is with us and I I'm like does he know what he's doing and you know he thinks he knows what he's doing and I quickly learned he doesn't know what he's doing and he just walks up and this is how he starts he's like well I don't know about you but I didn't come from no monkey and I'm like what is that what sharing our faith is cuz I don't want to do that you know yall with me this morning right so just in case you didn't know don't do that okay that's just that's a way not to do it um and yet here's the deal we're encouraged in Scripture that we are to share our faith with others like and can I just say this Jesus is so much more than your savior he's also your lord and if you understand lordship I know we live in a country where we vote for everything but in the Kingdom of Heaven we have a monarchy that means we have a king and he's in charge and we didn't vote he just is and if you understand lordship then you understand that when the Lord says to do something we obey does that make sense and he tells us that we are to share our faith now throughout this series we've been talking about different ways to own various things that are our responsibility that includes but is not limited to our money relationships hurt Etc but today I want to talk about how to own reaching people for Jesus my goal is to help us all discover a way to reach people for Jesus that is not only doable for everyone in this room but believe it or not it's actually what scripture tells us to do and so with that being said I want to go to Colossians chapter 4 we read verses 2-6 it says this devote yourselves to prayer being watchful and and thankful and pray for us too that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ for which I am in Chains pray that I may Proclaim it clearly as I should be wise in the way you act toward Outsiders make the most of every opportunity let your conversation be always full of grace seasoned with salt so that you may know how to answer everyone so Paul the author of Colossians here believes that reaching people for Jesus is imperative listen the gospel the good news of what Jesus did that message that we were singing about today in that third song where we're talking about how Jesus came and he not only died for our sins but he defeated death hell and the grave and the devil amen come on you with me this morning and he gave us eternal life that message is it's imperative that it's shared with others Paul believes this scripture teaches this we see that when we look at the body of Paul's work however In this passage specifically Paul both explicitly and implicitly seems to have a clear sense and I want you to check this out I don't want you to miss this Paul has a clear sense that there are some within the body of Christ that are uniquely gifted to be evangelists uniquely gifted we get an example of this in Ephesians 4: 11-12 it says so Christ himself gave the apostles the prophets the evangelists the pastors and teachers to equip his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up here's what Paul just said none of us can be an example of Jesus all by ourselves do you know nobody will get a full picture of Jesus by just looking at you it takes a community to pull that off and I want you to think about how important Community is think about the fruit of the spirit for example love how do you know if you're a loving person apart from another person you don't you say I supposed to have patience how do you know if you have patience apart from another person testing your PA you understand you can't even live like Jesus apart from other people so we need a community so here's what happens Jesus is the perfect Apostle the perfect Prophet the perfect evangelist the perfect pastor and the perfect teacher none of us are so here's what he did he said I'm going to take these gifts that bring people to me and I'm going to divvy them out among the body of Christ and you're going to have some and you're going to have some some and you're going to have some but here's what that teaches us 1 of the body of Christ are gifted evangelists like they're good at this does that make sense like here's what Paul just said right we can't be Jesus by ourselves we need other people to represent the fullness of Jesus to the world but here's what he also just said there are some people who are especially gifted at evangelism these are people who would stand on a chair in a cafeteria and preach the gospel and for those of you in this room that are like I could never do that it might be because you're not a gifted evangelist and that doesn't mean you feel shame or condemnation it just means your gift looks a little different you with me this morning listen I'm going to I'm going to free a lot of you today because some of you have been walking around condemned because you're like I don't know how to just talk to people about Jesus and you've been feeling like a bad Christian for a long time and and scripture and Paul are going to say stop condemning yourself amen so so here here's what that means right there are some people that are just bold at this like I heard one Pastor say one time he was a gifted evangelist he says every time he gets on an airplane he ask the person next to him so what do you do for a living and I'm in business or you know I'm in it or whatever it is and at some point they'll look at him and they'll say what do you do for a living and he goes I'm a pastor so guess what we're about to have that conversation I'm like I ain't doing that right it's just I'm not it's not that I'm a rebel it's just I ain't doing it right like um we have a a person on our team bold I mean he he will walk around our campus he will see somebody and I mean just be led by the spirit just walk up not even know them and say hey I see you're kind of you walk in you have a cast or whatever like hey why don't I just pray for you right here right now God might heal you he wants you to know him and there's other people on our team that are like I I'm they're praying I hope Josh never asked me to do that right they're they're they're terrified that that moment might come and the way Paul speaks he seems to think and feel as if he himself is a gifted evangelist and if we Circle back to the Colossians passage in verses 3 and four Paul tells us the church is to pray for gifted evangelists in two ways first that gifted evangelists would be given opportunities to exercise their gift so for all of us non-gifted evangelists we're supposed to be praying for the gifted evangelist to have plenty of opportunities Lord please send them people that don't know you so that they can exercise their gift and make them aware but then second when evangelists are given those opportunities we are to be praying that the message they Proclaim would be done so with boldness and Clarity because how how many of you know an unclear evangelist is not helpful like I don't know what I'm supposed to do right and so we're praying God give them opportunities and when those opportunities come would you let them be bold and would you let them be clear like that's what we're praying for like this church was started at its core by Pastor Herbert Pastor Herbert is an evangelist the guy loves to win people to Jesus he eat breathes and sleeps winning people to Jesus and so the best thing we can do when he's up in the pulpit and he's declaring the gospel Lord would you just be with Pastor Herbert would you be with Pastor Chris as they're in the Pulpit this morning and God would you give them plenty of opportunity even outside of the church and Lord when those opportunities come would you help them to be bold and would you help them to be clear because we want to see more changed lives does that make sense okay so that's part of our job my job as a non-gifted evangelist is to pray for people like them in two ways that they get opportunities and that those opportunities would be bold and clear but I want to point out something super important if Paul thought that every Christian was a gifted evangelist then you would expect him to say pray that I would have opportunities to speak the message of Jesus with boldness and Clarity and I will be praying the same for you but he doesn't say that right after coveting their prayers he says this but as for you verse 5 be wise in the way you act toward Outsiders make the most of every opportunity let your conversation be always full of grace seasoned with salt so that you may know how to answer everyone here's my point I don't think Paul believes that everyone is a gifted evangelist or that everyone has the ability to boldly proclaim the gospel with great clarity I think Paul believes that there are people within the community of faith that are uniquely gifted to be evangelists but for most of us four fifths of the body of Christ Our primary way of doing evangelism will be in response to people's questions notice he says in verse six know how to answer everyone you see this same concept echoed in 1 Peter 3:15 when he says to us always be prepared to give an answer for the hope that you have what do these verses imply these verses imply that people are asking us questions which also implies ready for this that we're living lives worth questioning it implies that you're being asked questions but the only way you're going to be ask questions is if you're living a life that begs people to ask questions right no one is going to ask you about the hope that you have if you live like everyone else if you don't love your spouse any better than the world does no one's asking you questions about marriage if you don't raise your kids differently than the world does no one's going to ask you about parenting if you don't exercise Faith differently than the world does because the world has faith it may not be faith in God but they got faith in something faith in money or a job or success but if your faith don't look different no one's going to ask you questions you have to live a life that begs the world to ask questions so let me be clear I'm not asking any of you to become a bold evangelist if you're not one instead I'm asking you to live a life that evokes suspicion and awakens questions live a life that is so radical and extraordinary that your Barista wants to know who you are are live a life that makes everyone around you ask who are you now the church I grew up in got a hold of this concept many years ago but they decided to go the wrong direction with it see my church made being different all about staying away from sinful people sinful people right and so the way we were going to be different was by being recognized by all the things we were against and let me tell you we were against a lot we were against watching TV oh you know it's an idol the hell Vision oh you don't think it's an idol I'm I'm this is a pastor you don't think it's an idol why do all the chairs in your room face it we were against watching Rated R movies but then The Passion of the Christ came out we didn't know what to do we're like Do We Rent Out theaters is that compromise uh it's about Jesus uh you see we were against wearing shorts and ball caps in church I remember like my dad would be like what do you got on I'm like shorts it's July and he's like we don't wear that in God's house I'm like why is God afraid of my knees God lives everywhere is what you told me I'm just living listening to my father if God lives everywhere he see me in the shower for God's sakes he can see me in shorts where a ball cap and one of the older Saints like get that hat off your head son this is the house of God and how many of you know anytime they say God they said it with a little spice God right I knew everything that we were against and then if that wasn't enough we were also against people we were against anyone that looked different than us so we were against people who had addictions or drank or smoke or cussed or had even a different stream of Faith so we were against you know different denominations and and and you just get to a point that being different became synonymous with all the things that you were against we became afraid of getting sinner sin on us and influencing us so we stayed away all together and we hit from the world but here's a problem from that thinking you can't reach in love what you're trying to hide from in other words the majority of the world is not going to ask you about the hope you have if you're trying to hide from them hiding from the world's not questionable it's just reclusive no one's asking you questions questionable living looks like parenting our kids with grace and patience and not blowing up on them when they make a mistake can I tell you I had to put that in practice this morning y'all this morning how many of you know if something's going to blow up at home it's going to be right before church come on like it's like like people just know right today like you know I cooked breakfast and I was getting ready and and one of my kids accidentally put something plastic on top of our uh you know glass top stove they didn't know it had been on and it just melts the plastic onto the the cooktop right and I have to leave I have to get here so I can come and pray get my mind right but I have a mountain of plastic melted on my stove and I'm like am I going to let Danny wake up to this or not and so I'm out there with the scraper you know and and my kid is just like I'm so sorry what they don't need what's wrong with you that's not what he needed no he needed someone to go hey we all make mistakes and dad's going to take care of this and I just need you to know you're okay he's like I just really need a hug to know I'm okay I'm like bro you get all the hugs you want you see it's in moments like that when the world says I would have just beat my kid and then you behave that way and they go I don't understand that why why do you do that let me tell you about Jesus and his grace see that's questionable living is like that questionable living looks like not spending all of our money on houses cars and stuff but in dead being generous and and giving it to people in need or things like Kingdom Builders like it's we we handle money differently questionable living looks like taking the time to know your neighbors and blessing them with hospitality and time in a world where everyone pulls into their garage after work closes the door and never comes out it's questionable to actually know all your neighbors cuz if you were like me I didn't know my name neighbors names I just knew them by their nicknames that me and the other neighbor gave them like there's Q95 guy there's pool guy there's mullet dude yeah like it's questionable for you as the Christian to have the house that everyone in your neighborhood wants to come to and they're like we love that place because when we're there we get poured into we get believed in we get loved on they feed us well like Hospitality awakens something right and so questionable living Looks Like Us opening our homes to our neighbors but it also looks like us opening our homes to children and teens who don't have great examples at home and being Jesus to them one thing I love about my sister is she picks up all of Jason's friends and brings them to youth group every Wednesday night and that's like a Ministry to her she ministers to these kids every Wednesday packs that van out listen I'm in a campus ministry and I can tell you there's a lot of our students that their parents are not involved in their life some of them don't have dads or don't know who their dads are and it is questionable for us to invite those people to come in and say let me be like a surrogate parent for you let me cook you some meals let me show you what a family does sit down and eat with my family and look how we love each other like this is what it is to have a loving family that's what it looks like see living like this has the ability to change lives but not just that it also has the ability to change the world and I know in church culture we're like we can change the world and and like sometimes we hear it so much that we're like you're right but the truth is we can living like this and and I want to give you an example so in the Roman Empire during the 4th Century after emperor Constantine dies there's this other guy named Julian that takes over and he becomes known as Julian the the apostate the apostate is someone who's walked away from the faith he hates Christianity he writes letter to his Governors telling them that he is concerned that they are going to lose the entire Roman Empire if they don't stop the Christians that's what he says he says if we don't stop the Christians we will lose the Empire stop the Christians from what preaching in the marketplace no door to-door evangelism no living in isolation from the world absolutely not his concerns were because the Christians at that time were feeding people who are not a part of their Community when someone from another culture died and nobody was there to tend to their grave or give them a funeral the Christians threw funerals for them and tended to their graves they took care of sick people in leper colonies where everyone's running away all the Christians were running in saying we'll take care of them if nobody wants them we'll take them the hospital was a Christian idea that's why so many of our hospitals are birthed in religious names because Christians came up with it they started hospitals they started hospices and they were the best at hospitality and what was happening is because of the way they live their lives and how questionable it was among the Roman Empire Romans Pagan Romans were looking at them and saying nobody cares for me like that I want to be a part of that and so they started joining the Christian Movement and Rome was losing all their people to Christianity and so Julian says if we don't stop this we're going to lose our Empire and so his Governor say what do you want us to do and he realized like if we start martyring these people the Christian faith only grows stronger so here's what he says and this is amazing he goes we have to find a way to start out loving the Christians he says I want you to build more hospitals love more people feed more more people and all of a sudden the kingdom starts expanding through a pagan leader see you have to understand it literally transformed the Roman Empire living this way questionable living of the Christians changed their world and here's my concern a lot of American Christians are not living in such a way that the outside world is inspired to ask us any questions my friends we need to learn how to live so counter culturally that people will want to ask ask who are you what church do you go to I want to drive home this point even more in Titus Chapter 2 you will read a long list of things that Paul wants people to do like be loving be self-controlled respectable pure in your marriage Etc why is he asking all of the followers of Jesus to do this Titus 2:10 he says so that in every way we will make the teaching about God our savior attractive why do we live this way so that we will make the teaching about God our savior attractive Paul was asking early Jesus followers to live questionable lives gifted evangelists have a peculiar role within the kingdom but for every other follower of Jesus the other four fifths of us our job is to live a life worth questioning so how do we do that practically let me share with you two stories that could give you an example and hopefully inspire you this message I'm preaching to you today is so revolutionized my heart like any Pastor could tell you this there's things that we have to preach on things we should preach on but every once in a while there's a message you come across that you're like this is so me this just oozes out of me this is it for me because I lived under so much condemnation feeling like I was such a terrible Christian because I I did not love sharing my faith with the way I was taught to share it I was like I can't do that I'm not good at that I'm uncomfortable with that and I got a hold of this as the spirit revealed it to me and I said okay if I need to live a life that's questionable that's different I'm just going to start with wherever I am and what I did was instead of going to to places as like this is just the place I go to I started going to places on purpose with a mission so the first place that happened for me was at the barber shop obviously not now this is some eons ago um and I said you know a lot of people go into a barber shop and they just go to get their haircut and they get in they get out and I just said you know what what would it look like if I actually just became friends with my barber like actual friends and can I tell you like friends doesn't mean you just talk like you actually do something together so my goal was to get my barber to become a friend to the point it wasn't weird for us to go grab sandwiches together for us to hang out together cuz I was like I don't know anybody trying to like be friends with their Barber on that level I'll just start there and so I got to just asked him questions and started getting to know him and getting to know his story and listen they're captive audience they got to sit there and you know do their thing and and so it's like hey for a half hour I'm here you're here let's do this thing and over time over months of this it grew to a point where he started feeling more and more comfortable opening up more and more of his life and I'll never forget this he I was getting ready to book my next appointment he goes can I can I ask you a favor and I said yeah he goes from now on can I just book instead of a half hour can I just book an hour he's like I feel like I just want to talk to you when you're here and I said yeah I'm here for it man so the next time we have for an hour and he opens up his life story and he starts opening up about all of this suffering that he's encountered in his life how when he was in his 20s his wife left him with the kids and took off he in the middle of the night he had no idea where they went and this is before social media and all this like we weren't as connected he's like had no idea where his kids were he didn't know how to find them his kids were lost for him for years and then he finally gets reacquainted with his long lost daughter and about two months into their relationship in a drunk driving accident they go off a cliff they hit a cattle gate and one of the steel poles comes through the window and pierces her through a chest and kills her it's shortly after after that he then discovers he has this heart defect that his cardiologist is saying if you live to 50 it will be a miracle and at the time he's cutting my hair he's 43 years old and he's like I got seven years left he's like I'm remarried I have a daughter with this marriage and like I just want to live long enough to walk her down the aisle she was 12 years old and as he's opening all this up to me he goes Jos have just come to a conclusion he's like do you believe in God and I said I most definitely do he goes I do too but I think what God does is he separates all of humanity into one of two camps Those whom he loves and everyone else and he goes Josh I just think I'm everyone else and right there in the barber shop with tears flowing down his face I just said man God doesn't see you that way he's like how do you [Music] know I say because he spoke to my heart to sit in this chair every two weeks so we could get to this moment right now and I said he loves you he has a plan for your life and if you'll let him he'll show you and he's like I don't know if I can get there right away I said that's okay why don't you come with me to church and we'll just walk through this journey together he started coming to church he gave his life to Jesus we got to the point where it wasn't weird for us to go hang out we're at Jimmy John's having lunch together one day and he's like I got to show you this picture and I'm like yeah what's up and and in it is it's a bunch of teenagers from our our church and they're all in a huddle and they're praying and he's like do you know what this is I was like well it looks like our sanctuary and it looks like kids from our youth but what am I looking at he's like in the center of that huddle is my daughter she gave her life to Jesus last night at the youth service went up baptizing her like I don't need you to go to a street corner and start preaching to everybody I need you to love your Barber like he matters so let me give you one last story and there we're going to be done so for those of you that don't know me I I run a Ministry at IU Indianapolis called Kai Alpha we are a Ministry that is living this way on a campus because we feel like if there is ever a time where people have a crisis of Faith it's at the University level when everything's getting questioned and so we're like we want to reach these students for Jesus and so one time this is not when I was at IU this is when I was at Missouri State University doing this and we empowered our students just go love people like look for those who don't have someone and they found this girl and they just approach her and they're like hey you want to hang out with us and she's like uh I I don't know oh come on you want to hang out with us do you know anyone on campus no we're your friends come on they just invited her and she's like all right and then they're like what are you doing tomorrow she's like I don't know I just moved here and they're like great you're hanging out with us tomorrow and then they kept doing this for a week and week so she becomes a part of our ministry and she's a part of our ministry for a while and then we did this banquet and we asked her to give a just a a testimony and when she gives her testimony it's the first time any of us on staff have heard the story behind this and she said when I moved to campus I felt alone I didn't know anybody I had decided I had a plan I was killing myself that night I was on my way to my dorm room room to end it all and then this group of Kai Alfa girls came up to me and said why don't you hang out with us tonight and she said all right she goes in my mind I said I'll delay it till tomorrow I'll give this a shot but I'm doing it tomorrow and they go what do you got going on tomorrow well I don't know great you're hanging out with us she was I kept saying I'm going to delay it the next day the next and after a while I just for the why would I do that I have friends listen it's it's simply this just just hear my heart here it's simply this it's just treating people like they matter I mean that's all it is all of you probably a lot of you might go to a restaurant today what if you actually paid attention to your waitress what if not only that what if you always went to that restaurant always got the same waitress developed a relationship let her know you care about her and all of a sudden maybe she's transformed it's really simple and so it's just really a good time to do this because listen a lot of people are considering Jesus because Easter's next weekend like there are people that would not consider Church any other time but Christmas and Easter it's it's we're open and so I want to empower you in a very easy way okay so all of you have these on your seat right here's what I don't want you to do with this I don't want you to go to a restaurant give this to your waitress don't Tipp her and then walk away if that's your plan please keep these in your pocket because too many Christians have done that I used to work in the restaurant industry worst tippers that's not who Christians should be we're people of generosity we should be the best tippers 25 30% you're like I can't I can't give that don't go out to eat go home eat mac and cheese but get in someone's life this week actually love them for them not because you want something from them and in the process of that why don't you invite them because here's what I do know we're like yeah but I'm not a bold evangelist and I don't know how to preach the gospel with boldness and great clarity I know Pastor Chris can and I really believe if you can get people here they'll meet Jesus next week I believe that with all my heart and so that's what we're asking you to do invite people but then let that be the start of a process where you live differently from this point forward your goal as a Christian is to live a questionable life amen every

Xa9tjU4hT_A,well today we are wrapping up our series called stay in your lane in 1995 Gwen Torrance we have a picture of her she crossed the Finish Line in first place in the 200 meter run she had finally won a gold Med you can see it on her face the joy and the relief after all these years racing she finally won the gold and then shortly after this a judge came over to her and notified her that she had been disqualified because on the turn of the 200 meter she just just a edge of her foot stepped out of her Lane this dream of a gold was gone because she didn't stay in her Lane and the same will happen to us we won't live out our god-given purpose and plan for our lives if we step outside the lane that God God has for our lives and so today we're finishing our series stay in your lane preparing for your purpose and for several weeks we've been learning from the life of David God chose David and trusted him to be the king of Israel because he was fully surrendered to serving God's purpose instead of chasing after position promotion prominence and power David stayed in his Lane he prepared for what God had prepared for him he knew what God had for him was for him and I believe this Series has taught all of us to get in our lane and to stay there if you've missed any of the messages I encourage you go on our YouTube page and watch them and today I want to teach you how do we stay in our lane the rest of our life how do we make sure that on the final race or on the biggest race or the biggest stage of our life we're coming around a cur curve and we don't lose enough Focus to step out of our Lane that would be costly to us and so I I want to look at what the Bible says about David one last time and learn how we can stay in our lane for the rest of our lives and live out God's purpose for our life and so Psalm 78 verse 70 and 72 it says he chose David his servant and took him from the Sheep pins from tending the Sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob of Israel his inheritance in verse 72 says and David shephered them with Integrity of heart with skillful hands he led them today I want to share with you three steps to stay in your lane for the rest of your life the first step is this is keep our hearts clean keep our hearts clean Psalm 7872 it says David shephered them with integrity of heart David did this by keeping his heart clean now listen this doesn't mean that David was perfect because he wasn't he sinned he made mistakes but David but but God called David a man after his own heart and what do we learn from David about keeping our heart clean well Psalm 51:10 David said create in me a clean heart oh God renew a loyal spirit within me see when David sinned he wanted a clean heart he didn't want to live in sin he didn't want to live distant from God he desired to have a clean heart and David repented of his sin and then he prayed renew a loyal Spirit within me he's saying God I want my heart to be after you not after sin I want my heart to Crave you and not sin I want my heart guarded from sin and committed to you Solomon said it like this in Proverbs 4:23 Above All Else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it now I'll be honest with you I'm a little slow and I uh watch football is one of my favorite sports to watch and I even help chaplain the Lawrence North football team and I'll be watching games where a defensive back uh uh breaks up a pass like he he is on the wide receiver and he's on him tight and he's not letting them catch it and after that pass is incomplete they do this thing and I thought man is that like a sword you know what I mean are they like putting their sword back in its sheath you know like literally they'll do this I'm like what is that so I had to ask somebody I'm like what is that like oh that's a seat belt oh yeah you got locked yeah see I locked it but listen that's what we got to do with our heart we got to guard that heart we got to lock it up

a desire for a clean heart it's a dangerous place to be when you no longer desire a clean heart see some of you you can't wait to sin some you're planning out your sin that's not guarding your heart you need to ask God to change your desires pray oh God give me a clean heart change my desires number two is stay close to God after David asked for a clean heart then he prayed in Psalm 5111 do not banish me from your presence and don't take your Holy Spirit from me to guard your heart you need the presence of God you need to stay close to God you need to consistently be in the presence of God

him and so I want to encourage you spend time with listen find your Rhythm find your Rhythm find do you not to do what everybody else is doing do what works for you get on the Bible app or or get a Bible that you that you like and that you can enjoy and find a spot and and make it your spot and make it your time but get a rhythm this this year I I decided I'm I'm just been going through the Psalms and man here we are I'm still going through the Psalms and I'm only at Psalm 101 and you know what for like the last week or so I just been kind of stuck on Psalm 101 there's just some scriptures there that have just kind of touched my heart and I'm just kind of staying there I'm just staying there I'm just staying there God's speaking find your Rhythm find what works for you I remember years ago where God convicted me because I'm you know I like sports and uh I would I would you know wake up and normally got a couple ESPN notifications waiting for me on my phone and I would pull up my phone when I wake up and the first thing I would look at are those notifications and remember being convicted you know what if I'm going to do anything on my phone the first thing I do is I need to go to God's word I need to go to God's word and so I made a decision that's the first thing I'm going to look at it's the first thing I'm I look at if I wake up and I'm look at my phone I'm getting on the Bible app I'm going to do the the the verse of the day or I'm going to go to my Bible reading plan or I'm going to get some worship music but find your Rhythm find what works for you so you can stay close to God and then church family you got to put the right things in your heart evaluate what you're listening to and watching are you listening to and watching things that keep you in the presence of God or that pull you away from the presence of God Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6:12 that everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial there's some music you can listen to television shows you can watch videos on social media you can view that may be permissible but they aren't beneficial for you to stay in the presence of God and guard your heart you need to prayer the prayer of David God keep me in your presence I like shows Jamie and I we have some shows we watch together and I have some of my own shows and every once in a while I get in a show Hole all right and so on Netflix now a lot of times they'll show you like the top 10 shows and I'll go look at and some of I'm like oo that looks like a really good show I I get excited like oo but then I noticed those four letters TV M now listen not all TV MA is is bad or you shouldn't watch but that's an that's a that's a as a red light for me because you may not know this but once you hit play on the show they don't do it very long but really quickly they'll put up in the upper leftand corner why that show is tvma and so when I click play because you know sometimes it may be Gore and I'm like I can roll with some gore but then up there it's nudity sex and I'm like no no I ain't rolling with that well it's not on my top 10 get off my list and sometimes it's hard sometimes I stay in a show Hole cuz I'm going to guard my heart I'mma guard my heart I got I got to guard my heart I remember when I gave my life to Christ and and before I gave my life to Christ I had all kind of CDs all kind of music all all kind of inappropriate explicit lyrics and all kinds of sexual immorality and debauchery and all all kinds of mess and I remember after I got saved I got convicted and I threw all my CDs away threw them all away like got to guard my heart can't be pumping my mind with that stuff there's a season in my life where God convicted me about how much how much I was watching sports that it was taking away from my family time it was taking away time from my kids that at times it was making me a a mean and angry person over some sports like y'all game one and game three of the Pacers about 10 years ago oh I would have been angry the whole week don't talk to me for two weeks don't let me see a Celtics fan I'm just playing but I would have been angry and so you know what God had to do a work in my life and so I had to I had to set some boundaries I had to cut some of the sports out and what I was watching and I had to make sure I was keeping my my my my family a priority and I know even as I say these things you think man that's extreme Pastor what kind of Pastor you know well I guess you a pastor so that's okay but listen here's all I want you to do everybody in the room this is all I want you to do I want you to ask God God is there anything in my life pulling me away from you and your plan it's all I want I want you to do God is there anything in my life I don't see it right now but I'm asking you to help me see it is there anything that is permissible but it's not beneficial and it's causing me to drift out of my lane and whatever God speaks to you you listen my convictions are not your convictions I just share them as an example for you but church family we need to make every decis decision with our hearts in mind it's the little areas that can cause us to get out of our lane and miss out on living God's purpose for our lives it's the daily decisions that determine the condition of our heart and the best way to keep our hearts clean is by staying close to God so number one keep our hearts clean number two keep your head clear Psalm 78 says David LED with Integrity of heart and with skillful hands it takes keeping a clear head to live a life of integrity and to have skillful hands you don't maintain your integrity without a clear mind you don't lead skillfully for a long haul without a clear head it takes intentionality it takes Focus my my son Jace is getting his license and we we're getting them all his driving hours in and I notice that when I'm driving and I'm just talking about whatever Sports and school school when I'm talking his ear off all of a sudden he starts making wrong turns and getting confused because I am distracting him I'm like okay Dad needs to hush up and let the new driver Drive let him Focus let him Focus see when it comes to staying in your lane for the rest of your life and living out your purpose having a clear mind is essential you must have intentionality and focus because how you view things things will ultimately determine how you do things and one of the biggest things that causes us to lose our focus and not maintaining a clear mind are all the voices in the world shouting at us the Bible says in 1 Peter 5'8 be alert and of sober mind the enemy the devil prows around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour no doubt the enemy was roaring at David to try to get him to lose his focus and not fulfill his god-given purpose and the devil he is roaring at you to try to get you to lose your focus the enemy is looking to devour your mind your thinking your thought life and ultimately he's looking to devour your purpose and the enemy works over time to gain access into your thinking so that he can prevent you you from carrying out the purpose God has for your life he's constantly in your ear trying to distract you like I was distracting Jace he wants to access your mind so that he can plant seeds of doubt and fear and discouragement and deception he wants to fill your mind with lies he wants to Roar his lies so loud that you can't hear or focus on what God has for your life and notice it says the devil is like a lion he is not a lion it's like me barking right now I'm barking but I'm not a dog and the devil Roars but he is not a lion the only lion is our Lord and savior Jesus is the lion of Judah and when Jesus Roars the devil shuts up and we need to let God's word roar louder in our life louder than the fake Roar and lies of the enemy and the enemy he Roars in so many ways he will even use the voice of people and culture to Roar his lies into our minds he uses media to Roar at us voices of peers and Friends roaring at us voices of social media media roaring at us voices of Family roaring voices voices of quote unquote experts are roaring nowadays everybody's an expert you know what I mean if you have a phone and you can submit a post or comment on social media you're an expert and you're roaring at people don't let the devil Roar his lies into your mind and distract you from your purpose if you listen to the wrong voices you will make the wrong choices keep a clear head and listen to the Roar of God's word one of the attacks on me is fear and anxiety and boy the enemy he will come roaring and I got to I got to take God's word and I got to Roar back over over and over again I got to remind myself for the Lord does not give a spirit of fear but of power and love and of sound mind and I got to keep saying it louder and louder to drown out the lies of the enemy you got to keep your head clear and then number three keep your hands steady our key verse says David was skillful David was a skillful musician he was a skillful Warrior he was a skilled writer he was a skilled leader he was the best of the best in everything he did because he had steady hands he led people with skillful hands and fulfilled his purpose because he kept his hands steady and in Acts 13:36 it says now when David had served God's purpose in his own generation he fell asleep this verse is so challenging to me life is so busy but in the midst of all the busyness David kept a steady hand and lived out God's purpose here's what we can learn about David and keeping a steady hand number one is this develop our skills develop our skills we have to make it a priority to develop our skills none of us become skilled on accident God wants us to be the best we can be with the gifts that he's given us God has called you to be the best student you can be to be the best employee you can be to be the best business owner you can be to be the best spouse you can be to be the best parent you can be the best friend you can be and the best leader you can be God wants each one of us to work hard to develop skillful hands and it takes skillful hands to fulfill your god-given purpose but first you got to discover your gifts that's why we have our growth track class growth track it starts next Sunday at 11:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. that class it's going to help you discover your gifts and then in that class you'll get to join the Dream Team and the dream team is then going to help you develop your gifts if you have not gone through growth track get into growth track this summer sign up to start next week to discover your gifts and then get on the Dream Team so that you can develop your gifts and then and then secondly stay focused on God's purpose listen your life is busy there's so much we can do with our time but be like David and to live God's purpose we have to St we have to have steady hands listen that means we can't do everything I have this cup here it's full of water this is my life this is my cup this is God's purpose for my life and listen I got to have steady hands to carry this cup and not spill it but you know what's going to cause me to spill this if I start trying to pick up everybody else's cup our world will keep filling US cups your neighbors your family members that keep trying trying to give you cups and I got to say no no no I got to stay in my Lane I got to carry my cup my cup is God my family Jamie Jace Callie Cohen and my Ministry that is my cup I can't go around carrying other people's cups I can sometimes we like to pour other cups get in all kinds of hobbies and all kinds of different things no no no I got to focus on my cup I got to love God I got to provide for my family I got to build the kingdom of God and have a steady hand and not spill I can't be grabbing other people's cups or filling up other cups and trying to hold them many of you you're spilling out God's purpose you're getting out of your lane because you're trying to hold too many cups You're trying to hold five of these bad boys and you cannot do it the best way for me to have a steady hand is just to carry my cup the cup that God has for me the calling the purpose that he has for my life listen church family it takes steady hands to stay in your lane and live out your purpose as followers of Jesus we need our hands fully committed to doing the work of the Lord loving our families working hard at our jobs working hard at school improving our skills reaching our lost neighbors and co-workers and classmates and family with the love of God serving at church to build the Church of Jesus Christ to see more changed lives loving God and loving people you have to keep a steady hand to live out your god-given purpose remember God made you on purpose for a purpose he has chosen you for a special purpose you need to become who you're supposed to become so that you could do what you're supposed to do and may God say of all of us as he said of David now when Chris Smith had served God's purpose in his own generation he fell asleep come on make that personal let it be said of you of me now when Chris put your name in there now when your name had served God's purpose in his own generation he fell asleep
bzJ0XvzYJ_c,well today we are continuing our series called winning and our theme verse for this uh series has been first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24. the bible says don't you realize that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize so run to win god created you to run this life to win throughout this series we've talked about so many areas that god wants us and created us to win in and today i want to talk to you about winning at work winning at work there was a global poll conducted by gallup and it has uncovered that out of the world's 1 billion full-time workers only 15 of people are engaged at work that means an astronomical 85 of people are unhappy in their jobs and maybe you're here today and you're one of those 85 percent you feel overworked over regulated under leisured under benefited well today i want you to take heart there was a notice that was found in the ruins of a london office building and it was dated 1852. it says the firm has reduced the hours of work and the clerical staff will now only have to be present between the hours of 7 00 am and 6 pm weekdays it goes on to say no member of the clerical staff may leave the room without permission from the supervisor no talking is allowed during business hours now that the hours of business have been drastically reduced the partaking of food is allowed between 11 30 a.m and noon but work will not on any account cease it ended by saying the owners recognized the generosity of the new labor laws but will expect a great rise in output of work to compensate for those near utopian conditions come on aren't you glad it's not 1852. my goodness i'm sure these folks felt like they were losing and many still do today even though work conditions are far far better than 18 studies show that dissatisfaction at work is at an all-time high and that's a bummer because we spend the bulk of our week at work like pastor you're depressing me that's not what i want to do i want to help you today i want to help you and so as an introduction i'd like to give you three myths about work three myths about work the first myth is this work is to be endured you just have to gut it out let's be honest that's how a lot of us can feel but it's not the way that god wants it to be for us as a matter of fact it was the opposite from the very beginning and we're going to look in the beginning in genesis in just a moment but throughout scripture we see that work is not to be endured but enjoyed ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 18 through 19 it says even so i have noticed one thing at least that is good it is good for people to eat drink and enjoy their work under the sun during the short life god has given them and to accept their lot in life and it is a good thing to receive wealth from god and good health to enjoy it to enjoy your work and accept your lot in life this indeed a gift from god work is a gift from god that god wants us to enjoy not a burden to endure let me share with you a second myth about work is that work is a part of cursed creation come on every thought man adam and eve just had to mess it up for everybody when i get to heaven i'm going to give them a piece of my mind and you know some people are surprised to know that work was a part of god's plan before sin and its consequence ever entered the picture picture the bible shows that from scripture that work it's a part of god's character not sin's curse look at genesis chapter 2 verse 1-3 it says thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array by the seventh day god had finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he rested from all his work then god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done god worked and then when he created adam one of the first things he did was he gave adam a job genesis 2 15 it says the lord took man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and to take care of it see work existed before sin ever entered the world it was a part of god's character it was a part of god's plan let me give you the third myth about work the purpose of work is simply a paycheck this kind of mindset will get you in trouble earning a paycheck is a good thing it's a biblical thing but when you reduce your work to a paycheck you're going to suffer genesis chapter 2 verse 19 through 20. it says now the lord god had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky he brought them to the man to see what he would name them and whatever the man called each living creature that was its name so the man gave names to all the livestock the birds in the sky and all the wild animals see adam was given this responsibility to name all the animals i wonder what that would have been like you know what i mean adam's sitting there like elephant yeah i like that one hmm chimpanzee oh yeah yeah that's good um hip um potamus hippopotamus i like that at some point i think he might have got a little tired too he's like okay bird blue bird red bird a big bird he just he got to name all of them but that was a part of his job as he did god's work i'll be honest with you as a kid i hated having to mow the lawn did anybody even as a kid hate having to mow the lawn of mine okay praise the lord i'm not the only one let me be honest as an adult i still don't really enjoy mowing the lawn come on is there anybody with me that no i don't enjoy it but i will do it but you know what it never fails as a kid i didn't appreciate it but as an adult when i get done mowing the yard there's just something inside of me that just looks at that lawn and just sees man that lawn looks good there's just something that like man now just to look at it in man the lines are are are looking nice and i listen i believe that's something that god planted in me that is something that god has planted in us and to work a job where it's only about a paycheck it is not going to satisfy you'll never win and god wants you to win at work god wants you to win if you're a student god wants you to win at school and your schoolwork and your relationships and so as you live as you live for him on your campus and so i want to give you three keys to winning at work three keys to winning at work first key is this see your career as your calling see your career as your calling see too many people mistake the of thinking their ministry is at church but what they do at work is just a job they draw an unfortunate line between what they consider to be secular or sacred what i do at work is secular but what i do at church is sacred and you need to know that god created you on purpose for a purpose and your god-given purpose it's a sacred calling i want you to start looking at your work as sacred ephesians 2 10 the bible says for we are god's handiwork created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared for us in advance to do god doesn't just want you to work he wants you to do good works not just working for money but working for his glory and for your good and the same god that created the earth and all the living creature is the one that created you he didn't need you he didn't need me but he wanted us and he created us with a divine purpose and there's nothing small or insignificant about it if you see your job as just a job you'll never win at work but god created you with a sacred calling listen your business mind your people skills the way you can work with your hands the way you can process technology or talk to people the way that you sell things or the way that you execute the your creative ability everything you're doing the the mind and the ability and the strength that you have to do your work it was given to you by god god gave you that ability it's it's it's sacred it was placed in you and and by god to carry out his calling and his purpose for your life and when you begin to see it for what it is it's gonna change the way you look at work when you begin to see your job as sacred as part of your calling you're gonna start to look at things differently you're gonna start to dig into the word of god the ultimate hr manual to learn about okay lord how should i be handling myself at my job how can i do better to encourage others serve others work hard and and with excellence when you start to look at your job and work as sacred you begin to start praying over your meetings praying over your day praying over your discernment asking god to help you with the decisions that you're making you'll you'll pray over lesson plans before you teach them at your school you'll pray for strength as you work on cars and mow yards and and do landscaping career listen your career it's a calling it's sacred when you start to view it that way it's going to help you to win at work let me give you the second key to winning at work see your work as worship see your work as worship another great key to winning at work is to remember who you're working for there's no perfect boss because there's no perfect people but frankly some people are harder to work for than others but when we realize all we are doing is for god's glory rather than man's approval there's a shift and while god doesn't base his love for us on our performance for him we win when we see our work as a way to worship him colossians 3 17 the bible says and whatever you do everybody say whatever whatever you do whether in word or deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him come on when you're preparing taxes you're doing it for god when you sell insurance you're doing it for god you can actually bring praise to the lord by working with excellence as you detail cars or as you clean houses it's worship it's doing whatever we do including work in the name of the lord jesus and that verse that said it's also we need to give thanks god thank you for giving me this teaching job i give thanks lord for you allowing me to paint these houses lord let my work today at this nursing home be honoring to you and i thank you for this job listen friends when you approach your work as worship you are setting yourself up to win and when in the biggest way because god loves to reward his children he even promises us that if we work hard and what we do we do it for him he has a blessing waiting for us look at colossians chapter 3 verse 23-24 it says whatever you do work at it with all your heart as working for the lord not for human masters since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the lord as a reward it is the lord christ you are serving that's why we work hard because it's worship that's why we show up on time that's why we keep our word that's why we speak the truth because it's worship that's why we honor our boss and our co-workers while we avoid gossip why we have good attitudes because it's worship god i want to worship you with my work and the way that i work and even when the work environment is difficult the boss seems unbearable the co-workers get on your nerves the customers are rude you take the high road you keep a pep in your step you smile while you wait those tables because you know god is watching and you know it's god you're serving it's god you're serving and you know he's gonna bless you more than any earthly paycheck ever will that's how you win at work it's worship see your work as worship and then number three the third key to winning at work see your workplace as your mission field see your workplace as your mission field somebody needs to hear this today the reality is that every job has pros and cons there's no such thing as a perfect job there's no such thing as a perfect boss but sometimes people find themselves in a very difficult work situation you don't respect the values you don't appreciate the language the crew jokes you see dishonesty or a lack of integrity and it's hard to be around it and i wonder what kind of impact it would have on you and your workplace if you truly believe that god was sending you there to make a difference let me say that again i wonder what kind of impact it would have on you the way you look at your job the way you look at your co-workers the way you feel the night before the morning of the car ride there what kind of impact would it have on you in your workplace if you truly believe god was sending you there to make a difference here's what the bible says in matthew 5 14-16 you are the light of the world a city set on a hill cannot be hidden nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a stand and it gives light to all in the house in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven as followers of jesus we're on our way to heaven i believe jesus is coming back for us soon but until then we're on assignment and your workplace is your mission field and if god listen god is sending you on a rescue mission and that means he's sending you to people that are hurting that need jesus that's why we're still here and that's why he's placed you there at least in this season and and so don't miss this your workplace is one of the your absolute best chances to lead someone to christ i know some people pass out tracks and some people rent billboards and i believe god can use anything but historically speaking the the most who come to christ do throw do so through a relationship they have come on how many of you came to christ because of a relationship friend co-worker family raise your hand right now i mean most of us in this room we came to christ through a relationship the most effective way to bring hope to people who are hurting is by building a bridge to their heart and allowing jesus to walk over you do that by letting your light shine show them what joy looks like even in difficult times show them what integrity looks like show them what hard work looks like show them what a positive attitude looks like show them what true peace looks like even in a storm people who see you every day at work they should be getting a first-hand look at what it looks like to have hope in this world a hope that affects your attitude your kindness your patience your words and even your work ethic come on let's be honest if you show up to work late you're grumpy you're negative lazy you're doing sloppy work and then you're like hey would you like to experience the life i found in jesus most folks are going to be like no thank you see your work is your witness and you win when you take advantage of the opportunity to represent christ represent christ at your school on your team in your dorm represent christ at the office or at the construction site listen i want to encourage you in your workplace in your work live by the golden rule the golden rule is treat others the way you would want them to treat you listen the golden rule even works at work lead others the way you would want them to lead you manage others the way you would want them to manage you sell unto others the way you'd want them to sell unto you cook unto others the way you'd want them to cook over you when i was home from college i would work at donato's pizza y'all like some donatos it's probably one of my favorite uh takeout pizza places and i remember donatos said uh their pepperoni pizza edge to edge pepperoni i remember one day i got a pizza from there and i'm like that is not edge to edge oh no they didn't so when i worked there oh you better believe they're getting my pizza they're getting it the way that i want it we going edge to edge uh you know how frustrating it is when you order a pizza and it doesn't come the way that you order it and i said you know what every pizza i'm not gonna slack i'ma hook em up get them to write toppings because that's the way i would want come on teach others the way you would want them to teach you sell cars unto others the way you would want them to sell to you if you're a plumber plum unto others the way you'd want to come on if you're a barista barista unto others build houses unto others the way you would want them to do it to you treat people with respect honor your boss the way you would want your team to honor you serve the owner the way you would want to be served if you own the company that's the bible's way to win and i know it won't always be easy and you may be in a difficult situation to work in you may be in a place that's not a whole lot of fun to hang around but this is your chance to build a bridge you might even be thinking right now pastor but i don't like these people i don't even want a relationship with those people let me remind you jesus does jesus does whatever your job is wherever you're working whatever school you're at it is not by chance it's on purpose you are created on purpose with a purpose and god wants you to turn your work that is your mission field that is where god wants you to be a minister that's not that you're the minister i am but so are you he wants you to be a minister at that car wash a minister to your business and all your employees a minister to the bank a minister to your fine whatever minister in your school wherever you are at god has you there on purpose for a person and we win at work when we realize our career it's a calling god has given you the ability to do everything that you're doing there it is sacred that your work it's worship again it's not about serving a boss or a manager it's about going there and it's about serving the lord and honoring the lord and that your workplace it's a mission field i believe god has strategically put you there to share show and shine the love of jesus to everyone that you're around
ScnLVqPokqE,well today we are starting the series dysfunctional why relationships aren't working and we're going to dive in every single week into God's word to learn how to really navigate all of our uh relationships and so as we as we kick off today I'm going to talk to you about some uh relationship side effects but one of my family's favorite one of our favorite shows is to watch America's

side effect happen to me but there are some problems where you're taking the medication and you'll deal with the side effects because the benefits of the medication outweighs the side effects and I've learned this about life human relationships has side effects living life in close proximity to other human beings has side effects sometimes you might want to get rid of every person in your life so you don't have to deal with the side effects but you can't avoid all human relationships even if you could get rid of people listen that's not the answer to living a healthy and blessed life we need people we need each other come on look at your neighbor and say you cause side effects but I need you now come on just tell them you cause some side effects but I need you I I still need you so I'm I'm not going to get rid of you I need you uh when it comes to relationships a lot of people are discouraged disillusioned defeated and devastated because they are unaware of the side effects that come with human relationships and so today I want to make you aware of some of the side effects that make relationships so hard I want to shed some light on why our relationships aren't working why they're struggling and all the challenges in life man why does this have to be so difficult is because there's side effects and as you hear these side effects I want you to know that many of our relationships are harder than they should be because we're never taught how to handle the side effects of relationships and so we respond in a wrong way and things get worse they get more complicated some of your relationships they're not working because of you yes there are some side effects but your responses are making things worse and so throughout this series we're going to learn why relationships aren't working and how to make them work better listen this is not a marriage Series in this series we will address different types of relationships because relationships are a huge part of our quality of life so we need to learn how to make them work better and here's my guarantee if you will attend every week of this series your relationships will get better if you'll attend every single week of this series your relationships will get better if you have to miss one please go to our YouTube page and watch the message and so today we're going to go over seven relationship side effects seven relationship side effects this is why it's so hard to have relationships and why they're not working here's the first side effect of relationships and that is we blame each other we blame each other blame is something that started from the very beginning if you look at just the two people being on Earth that God gave some very simple directions God said to Adam and Eve look at this Garden this huge Garden all of this is yours look at all of the food all of the scenery isn't beautiful come on your spouse is always naked come on there was a gentleman in the back hey well hey what's the pastor talking about oh man I'm gonna like this series come on preacher Pastor what what Adam and Eve beautiful the scenery is beautiful oh they can eat God's like you have all of this is yours listen I just got one rule you just cannot eat from this one tree you can have you can eat from every other tree in the garden just don't eat from the one tree and if you know the story they ate from the tree and their first response was to play the blame game Genesis chapter 3 verse 12 and 13. God's like what happened the man said the woman you put here with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it oh can you imagine the side eye you was sitting there right next to me while I was eating that for you didn't say a word you was ready to take another bite you was Googling over me while I was eating that fruit like hey let me get a bite then the Lord God said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent oh I'm pointing at Adam hold on the serpent deceived me and I ate the blame game is one of the reasons why relationships are so hard instead of helping one another we will blame one another you blame your sibling for your room being dirty blame your coaches for not getting enough playing time blame teachers for not having good grades blame your co-workers for your poor work performance blame other people's kids for your kids acting bad blame your boss for your bad attitude blame your spouse for your marriage not working blame those people for your inappropriate behavior blame your friend for your addiction since the very beginning of humanity relationships have been hard because of the blame game I got a picture here this is why relationships are hard because it's his fault it's her fault it's therefore no it's not my fault it's his fault it's her fault it's there no no it's not me it's not my fault it's and we play in the blame game and the blame game is causing some negative side effects to relationships let me give you the second negative uh side effect let me give you another side effect of Relations number two is we deal with out of control anger we haven't even gotten out of the first four chapters of the Book of Genesis and we already find another relationship problem we had Adam and Eve first and then came their children Cain and Abel and they're having relationship problems if you don't know the story both of them brought an offering to the Lord and the Bible says that Abel's offering was looked upon with favor by the Lord look at Genesis 4 5 it says but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor and the Bible said so Cain was very angry and his face was downcast Genesis 4 8 it says now Cain said to his brother Abel let's go out to the field and while they were in the field Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him Cain's anger got so out of control that he killed his brother out of control anger causes so many problems in our relationships people don't know how to deal with anger in a healthy way someday stuff their anger and they let it build and they let it build and they let it build until boom it explodes some it don't even need to build come on it's just boom it just automatically yelling cussing throwing I mean it just expl and then there's some of y'all oh you're silent but deadly oh you give the cold shoulder the silent treatment people afraid to walk past you and make a noise some people even physically fight with one another when they're angry listen anger is one thing you can't get rid of by losing it one person said when you're angry you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret and there's so much pain and drama in relationships because of the side effect of out of control anger let me give you the third relationship side effect and that is we deceive and lie to one another deception is another side effect of relationships and we see it all throughout the Bible I'll just give you a couple examples in Genesis 25 19-34 in Genesis 27 Jacob deceived Esau out of his Birthright and the firstborn blessing he also deceived his dad who was blind made him believe he was his older brother then in Genesis 29 Jacob was deceived he was in love with Rachel and his uncle Laban deceived him and Jacob thought he was marrying Rachel but he actually had him marry Rachel's sister Leia in judges 6 Delilah deceived Sampson into telling her secret of his strength deception and lying it's one of the first things we do as human beings like no one has to teach us this I mean just think about your children just think about little kids you know what I mean when they're little and in the room in their bed all by themselves you sleep yes you know what I mean you walk upon them they got red marker all over their face you've been playing with the red marker no I've been putting their very little sometimes you get frustrated and tell them to take a nap and you and Mom you know trying to just have some snuggle time in your room and you hear that door handle start to turn ever so slightly [Music] you see that little eye like I don't see you and hear you you know when they're little they can be cute and funny sometimes or you know sometimes they can be frustrating but oftentimes it can be funny when a little kid lies and is deceptive but when it's your spouse your close friend your relatives your parents when it's your teenager or grown children deceiving and lying it can be devastating devastating when the people you love and are close to are destroying trust it can destroy something in you it's a relationship side effect number four is this we hold people's past against them Jesus knows a struggle Humanity has is we love to hold on to the Past we love to bring up people's past and use it against them we are not quick to forgive we are not quick to leave the past in the past and move on and Jesus illustrates this for us in Luke Chapter 15. it's in the story of The Prodigal Son the son goes to his father and asks for his inheritance he was not supposed to get the inheritance until his father passed away and so it was highly disrespectful for this child to come and ask for his inheritance while his dad was living but his dad goes ahead and gives him his inheritance and he leaves his father's house and he goes and he parties in Wild living and he spends all of his inheritance he squanders all of it and he hits Rock Bottom he is so broke that he starts working in a pig pen and he's so low so broke so hungry that while he's working in the pig pen he looks to eat some of the pig's slob he is at the lowest of lows and he starts thinking to himself what am I doing my father's servants have it better than I have right now and so he came to his senses and he swallows his pride and he goes back to the father's house and the Bible says when his father sees him in the distance his father runs to him and hugs him and gives him gifts and he calls everybody together my son is back my lost son is found we're throwing a party tonight get the fattened calf and so everybody is celebrating everybody is rejoicing that this young man gives back and changing his ways and everybody's celebrating except for his older brother look at Luke chapter 15 verse 28-30 it says the older brother became angry and refused to go in so his father went out and pleaded with him but he answered his father look all these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends but when this son of yours who has squandered your property who prostitute with prostitutes comes home you kill the fattened calf for him the young brother comes back from the biggest mistake of his life and all his older brother can do is throw his Pig Pen past in his face see sometimes in relationships it doesn't matter how much you've changed it doesn't matter how long ago it was or how many times you've apologized or how you've proved that you're not that person anymore some people keep bringing up your past and using it against you they remind you of your pig pen addiction they remind you of your pig pen of your line they remind you of your pig pen stealing remind you of your pig pen of bankruptcy remind you of your pigpen affair remind you of the pig pen of your parenting mistakes remind you of the pig pen of failed marriages remind you of the pig pen of your past one of the side effects that hurts our relationships is how we can hold the past against each other number five the fifth side effect is we are jealous of one another in Genesis chapter 37 Joseph's brothers show us what jealousy does to relationships his brother were jealous of him because he had a dream and they almost killed him but instead they decided to sell him into slavery see jealous people don't necessarily want what you have they just don't want you to have it Joseph's brothers they didn't like the fact that he had a dream and that his dream was to be successful and they didn't try to steal his dream but they did try to stop him from seeing his dream come to pass see jealous people make you feel bad about your success they interrupt you when you talk so they can talk about themselves they don't celebrate you they make everything a competition they can't handle you being blessed you enjoying life you having fun without them jealous people they'll try to undermine your success they they hate when you get compliments they're passive aggressive they belittle they try to make you look bad so so so that they can make themselves look good come on does anybody have some jealous people in your life come on raise your hand if you're sitting next to them I'm just playing I'm just playing I'm just don't don't do that don't do that some of y'all right oh no I didn't mean that no I the pastor got me but the side effect of jealousy it is hard on relationships let me give you the sixth side effect number six we betray and hate one another we betray and hate one another Jesus himself experienced a painful betrayal from one of his 12 disciples Judas was one of the Twelve Disciples that Jesus selected to be one of the twelve Jesus Judas was with Jesus he was with him in his ministry he saw Jesus heal people he saw Jesus do Miracles I mean Judas was there passing out the bread and the fish to the to the thousands he sat next to Jesus and had meals with Jesus I mean Jesus washed judas's feet and yet Judas betrayed him he betrayed Jesus and if Jesus was betrayed by someone close to him guess what you and I are going to be betrayed and the Bible prepares us for this side effect he talks about it it talks about it a life in the last days in second Timothy chapter 3 verse three through four it says they will be unloving and unforgiving they will slander others and have no self-control they will be cruel and hate what is good they will betray their friends be Reckless be puffed up with pride and love pleasure rather than God in the last days betrayal is going to run rampant and the hardest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies because you can't truly be betrayed unless you have trust in relationship and that's why it's so painful Martin Luther said each betrayal begins with trust it hurts deeply when people you love and Trust betray betray you it makes relationships really hard and then number seven the seventh side effect we are not faithful to one another we are not faithful to one another a massive relationship side effect as we're not faithful to one another like David and Bathsheba people are not faithful in marriage there's infidelity divorce abandonment there's so much marriage pain because of unfaithfulness people are not faithful to their families many parents and children's hearts are turned away from each other Malachi 4 6 it says he will turn the hearts of parents to their children in the hearts of children to their parents or else I will come and strike the land with total desecration in Matthew 10 21 it says brother will betray brother to death and a father his child children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death we are seeing this happen in our society today families torn apart because of unfaithfulness people are not faithful in Friendship Proverbs 18 24 it says who who has one who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin unreliable Unfaithful friends cause so much damage to people's lives matter of fact some of you you are hurting today because of an Unfaithful friend and then lastly people are not faithful to build God's kingdom together an example is Paul Paul was deserted in second Timothy chapter 4 verse 9 and 10. it says do your best to come to me quickly for demons because he loved this world has deserted me and is gone the thessalonica even Christians are not always faithful to one another we will desert each other we will leave each other high and dry we end relationships over pit Petty's stuff we don't work out our differences we give the devil a foothold and we allow him to divide us we allow the enemy to destroy our relationships because maybe if disagreements or or differences things that we don't want to forgive or work out or even just accept that we're different and so the enemy is dividing this relationship side effects and so what do we do with all these relationship side effects the blame the anger deception line holding on or are holding our past against each other jealousy betrayal unfaithfulness how do we make relationships work how do we make them better when we encounter so many side effects in our relationships we're going to talk about that next week so I need you to be here next Sunday every Sunday be here we're going to learn how to make relationships even with all these side effects we're going to learn from the word of God how we can make our relationships better
hwENXRQHlE4,well today we're continuing our series about the Holy Spirit this whole series started was based off a verse in Acts where uh Paul ran into some disciples that didn't even he he's like have you received the whole they're like we don't even know what the Holy Spirit uh is and there's a lot of people that don't know what the holy spirit is or don't understand the Holy Spirit or have misunderstandings and there's people that know a lot about the Holy Spirit and so each week we're just going to keep diving in and learning more and more about the Holy Spirit and today I've titled my message what is speaking in tongues what is speaking in tongues uh where are my coffee people at we got any coffee people in the house in here okay okay how many of you are hot you want it piping you are hot coffee folks okay how many are like me iced coffee I'm iced coffee all day long I'm just curious does anybody like lukewarm coffee any any Luke oh there's actually a couple of you that's surprising but you were definitely the minority I do not like my coffee lukewarm I'm an ice coffee person and uh and at Starbucks I got the gold card and so that means I get a refill on my iced coffee and there's times after I drank my first iced coffee that it still had a little bit of ice left in it but but not a lot of ice and I would give them my cup to get a refill and instead of pouring more ice into my cup they just pour coffee in there with just that little bit of ice and I can tell every time because I take a sip and it's not cold I need a cold this I got can I get a cup of ice I need some ice I want it I want it iced cold coffee I do not like lukewarm I am not a fan of lukewarm and neither is God Revelation chapter 3 verse 15 and 16. he says I know your Deeds that you are neither hot or excuse me you are neither cold nor hot I wish you were either one one or the other so because as you are lukewarm neither hot nor cold I am about to spit you out of my mouth John is writing to the church in the city called laodicea and this church has become lukewarm they have lost their passion for God what does it mean to be lukewarm it's when someone becomes indifferent has little enthusiasm lost their passion and conviction they're stagnant in just going through the motions and no one plans to be lukewarm but somewhere along the way they stop pursuing God they stop staying close to the Lord they stop taking spiritual next steps and to avoid lukewarmness you have to keep taking spiritual next steps when you stop taking spiritual next steps you become a prime candidate for Luke Warmness the Christian Life is a life of spiritual next steps and John tells the Church of laodicea how to break out of the bondage of lukewarmness the way out is to start taking spiritual next steps look at Revelation 3 20. here I am I stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come in and eat with that person and they with me John said you've stopped opening spiritual doors you have closed the Lord out of your life you stop taking spiritual next steps and when you stop taking spiritual next steps you will drift into lukewarmness Hebrews chapter 6 verse 11 and 12. it says our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life asks keep loving keep taking spiritual next steps in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent he's saying then you want you won't become lukewarm instead you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God's promises because of their faith and endurance take the next step and keep loving people or you will become lukewarm spiritually dull indifferent see there's always a next step to take with the Lord if you're not stepping forward you're slipping backward and don't ever buy into the lie that you've arrived imagine if a child is standing to take his first steps you know the little wobbly Weebly wobbly and everybody parents got the camera out in the photo and all of a sudden they take one oh come on you can do it and they're like dude and then all of a sudden yeah you did it they scoop up the child you did it you did it you walked you took your steps and then they put them in the corner okay now sit here and don't take an egg you're like that's crazy let that child walk let it take more steps why would you do that but Christians do it all the time in their Journey with Christ they think they've arrived spiritually and they stop taking next steps and so whether you have been a Christian for a week a month a year five years over 50 years there's always a next step you have to keep stepping forward or you will start slipping backwards there's always a next step there's the step of salvation there's the step of baptism in water matter of fact August 6 we're having water baptisms and so if you have given your life to Jesus Christ and you haven't taken the next step of getting water baptized sign up today it's your next step don't stop stepping forward don't stop moving forward if you stop moving forward you might start slipping backwards take that next step of baptism in water now the third there's the stepped of the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's the step of being continually filled with the Holy Spirit there's the step of growing in the fruit of the spirit there's the step of the gifts of the Spirit there's the step of daily prayer and Bible reading every day you should pray every day you should read your Bible get on the Bible app go buy a Bible if you don't have a Bible stop by guest Central and we will give you a Bible for free so that you can take that next step in reading the Bible there's the step of obeying God's word there's the step of growing in sanctification there's the step of stepping out in faith there's the step of serving others listen if you're not serving here at People's Church would you start would you join the Dream Team would you you wonder about how are we growing how are we reaching it's our Dream Team and the more people that serve the more people we can reach and if you haven't taken that and it's an incredible Next Step it's a double blessing God's going to use you to bless others but it's also going to bless your life you're going to be impacted by serving we got a table in the lobby where you can get signed up for the dream team today come on take that step when service is done take some steps out to the table and sign up to join the Dream Team there's the step of tithing and giving if you're not tithing would you start tithing if you stopped tithing would you start tithing again steps taking steps your next spiritual step there's a step of attending a small group September 10th is our small group launch and so pretty soon we're going to have small group leader trainings and we're gonna have the launch get in a small group God is calling some of you to lead a small group take a step forward so you don't don't start slipping backwards and today I want to focus on step number three being baptized in the Holy Spirit the baptism of the holy spirit is a second experience after salvation Jesus wants his disciples his followers to be baptized in the Holy Spirit in Acts 1 Jesus quoted what John the Baptist said in Matthew 3 11. look at acts 1 verse 4 through 5. it says on one occasion while he was eating with them he gave this command do not leave Jerusalem but wait for the gift my father promised which you have heard me speak about for John baptized with water but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit this was a second experience the disciples had with the Holy Spirit this wasn't when the disciples were sealed with the Holy Spirit for salvation it's where they were filled with the Holy Spirit for power to be a witness acts 1 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my Witnesses in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the Earth notice Jesus said the Holy Spirit comes on you not just in you at Salvation the Holy Spirit comes in you but the baptism of the holy spirit is about immersion that's where the word that's what the word baptism means to be immersed in other words you're filled to overflowing with the holy spirit let me explain it to you this way when you give your life to Jesus the waters the spirit the waters inside of you so every Christian give you as soon as you give your life to Jesus Christ the holy spirit is inside of you okay but God also wants you to be baptized in the Holy Spirit immersed to overflowing and so he wants to baptize you he wants to pour His Spirit out on you to overflowing all right and he in in the verse says be filled you can get more and more and more of the Holy Spirit his power to be a witness so that's the difference between being sealed with the Holy Spirit and being baptized in the Holy Spirit I believe the disciples receive salvation and the Holy Spirit came to live inside of them in John 20 after Jesus died on the cross and was resurrected from the dead look at John 20 verse 21 and 2. again Jesus said peace be with you as the father has sent me I am sending you and with that he breathed on them and said receive the Holy Spirit see Jesus had already died on the cross and had been resurrected when he said receive the Holy Spirit I believe this was the disciples salvation experience they had already believed in Jesus as the Son of God and so when Jesus said receive the Holy Spirit the spirit of God came to live inside of those disciples so in Acts 2 Acts 2 wasn't their salvation experience it was the baptism of the Holy Spirit salvation is about becoming a child of God being sealed with the Holy Spirit and securing your place in heaven the baptism of the Holy Spirit isn't about heaven according to acts 1 8 this is about power to be a witness not sealed with the Holy Spirit for salvation but filled with the Holy Spirit for power to be a witness let's read about it look at Acts chapter 2 verse 1 through 4. it says when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house they were sitting where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them so they were filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit not sealed with the spirit for salvation but being filled with the spirit for power to be a witness and what confuses some people isn't being filled with the Holy Spirit for power to be a witness it's the tongues part that confuses people and I don't want my church family to be confused and so let me help you better understand tongues there have been some who have said people have to speak in tongues to be saved they try to take Acts 2 and one other passage of scripture we're going to look at in a few moments and say people have to speak in tongues to be saved first of all some of these disciples in the upper room had followed Jesus for three and a half years they believed in Jesus they received the Holy Spirit in John 20. they were in a prayer meeting in Acts 1. they were called Disciples and followers of Jesus already Acts 2 was the baptism of the Holy Spirit not salvation secondly the only thing you have to do with your tongue to be saved is found in Romans 10 9. let's look at it Romans 10 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved you're saved by confessing with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believing in your heart not by speaking in any tongues or by any other work or deed Ephesians 2 8 9 it says for it is by Grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of God not by work so that no one can boast another thing that is confusing to people is when people speak in tongues without an interpreter I remember being in a church service I wasn't even saved and there were some people speaking in tongues loudly and I'm lying I ain't coming back to this child I don't know what in the world is going on here I was like are they speak in Spanish I'm like wait wait is that a I I just so I want to help you here there are two types of tongues in the Bible there is the gift of tongues which is one of the gifts of the Spirit found in First Corinthians 12 7-11 the purpose of the gift of tongues is to edify and build up others by someone interpreting the tongues secondly there's the personal prayer language the purpose of the personal prayer language is to edify and build up the person who is speaking in tongues there's a difference between the gift of tongues and the personal prayer language Let me show this to you in the Bible and it will help clear up some confusion as we read the scripture Paul goes back and forth between the personal prayer language which is for personal edification and the gift of tongues which is for corporate edification look at First Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 4 through 5. it says anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves he's talking about a personal prayer language edifies the person speaking in tongues but the one who prophesies edifies the church he says I would like every one of you to speak in tongues he's talking about personal prayer language but I would rather have you prophesy because this benefits the entire church the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may be edified so there he's talking about the gift of tongues so that the church is edified and then Paul goes on to show us the distinction between the gift of tongues and the personal prayer language look at First Corinthians chapter four excuse me chapter 14 verses 12 through 19. he says so it is with you since you are eager for the gifts of the Spirit and one of those gifts of the Spirit is speaking in tongues we talked briefly about the gifts of the Spirit in last Sunday's message and again they're found in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7 through 11. he says since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit try to excel in those that build up the church the gifts of the Spirit build up the church they build up other people he says for this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say Paul is saying in a church setting in a small group setting when someone speaks in a tongue they should pray for someone to interpret otherwise it will not benefit or build up the church because no one knows what the person is saying verse 14. he says for if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful so what shall I do he says I will pray with my spirit Paul doesn't forbid a personal prayer language he is simply helping this church that was having chaotic and out of order church services to do things decently and in order Paul was teaching how to conduct teaching them how to conduct themselves in God's house he says but I will also pray with my understanding I will sing with my spirit but I will also sing with my understanding otherwise when you are praising God in the spirit you can praise God in the spirit referring to tongues that's okay to do to edify and build yourself up spiritually but it doesn't help build up the church he says otherwise when you are praising God in the spirit how can someone else who is now put in the position of an Inquirer say Amen to your Thanksgiving since they do not know what you are saying verse 17 he says you are giving thanks well enough but no one else is edified Paul was teaching that in the church if they praise God in tongues in the church or excuse me if they praise God in tongues the church isn't edified only the person who is speaking in tongues is edified and so Paul says stop being out of order and only thinking about yourself and verse 18 he says I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you Paul says I speak in tongues all the time I have a personal prayer language that builds me up and I understand what Paul is saying because since I was 18 years old I've been speaking in tongues to build myself up spiritually and it is greatly benefited me and encouraged me in my walk in my relationship with God in verse 19 he says but in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue and I try to model what Paul teaches in the church I want to speak so everyone can understand me and so there's a again there's a difference between the gift of tongues which needs to be interpreted so that the church can be edified and built up versus the personal prayer language which is for a person to be built up and doesn't need to be interpreted and so I hope I'm helping you I hope I'm I hope I'm teaching you some things today now that we shed some light on the difference between the gift of tongues and the personal prayer language I want to focus back on the baptism in the Holy Spirit let's look at some more examples of people who had this second experience with the Holy Spirit Acts chapter 19 verse one through five it says while Apollos was at Corinth Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus there he found some disciples and asked him did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed they answered no we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit so Paul asked then what baptism did you receive John's baptism they replied Paul said John's baptism was a baptism of repentance he told the people to believe in the one coming after him that is in Jesus on hearing this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus this was their salvation experience they believed in Jesus they were water baptized listen if they weren't saved Paul wouldn't have baptized in water because they would have went into the water a dry Sinner and they would have came out of the water a wet sinner but these people were born again they were saved and we know the Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of the believer at the very moment they give their life to Christ we see that in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 and you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of Truth The Gospel of your salvation when you believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised Holy Spirit at Salvation 100 of the time the Holy Spirit comes to live inside the Christ follower so these disciples at Ephesus have the Holy Spirit living inside of them they were water baptized and next we see them receive the second experience called the baptism of the Holy Spirit back to Acts 19 6-7 it says When Paul placed his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied there were about 12 men in all these Believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit no one has to place their hands on us to receive salvation it's not by works so that no one can boast this was the baptism in the Holy Spirit and it says they spoke in tongues and prophesied you don't have to speak in tongues and prophesy to be saved this was not salvation it was the baptism of the holy spirit this was not the gift of tongues that's why it wasn't interpreted the Believers at Ephesus received a personal prayer language which is for a person to edify or build themselves up spiritually look at acts 18 or excuse me acts 8 verse 13 through 18. it says Simon himself believed and was baptized and he followed Philip everywhere astonished by the Great Signs and miracles he saw when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God this was their salvation experience Ephesians 1 13 the holy spirit is now living inside of them it says they sent Peter and John to Samaria when they arrived they prayed for the new Believers there that they might receive the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then Peter and John placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit now this is referring to the baptism of the Holy Spirit not salvation no one has to lay hands on you to be saved or for the Holy Spirit to come live inside of you you just need to give your life to Christ this was the the baptism of the holy spirit for power to be a witness in verse 18 it says when Simon saw that the spirit was given at the laying on of the Apostles hands he offered them money we can't be 100 sure what Simon saw because the Bible doesn't tell us maybe he saw them speaking in tongues or praising God or maybe he saw them prophesying we are 100 percent sure but we do know there was some type of outward sign that these people had been baptized in the Holy Spirit look at Acts chapter 10 verse 44-46 it says while Peter was still speaking these words the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God this is the other passage of scripture where people try to say you have to speak in tongues to be saved but again we know that the Bible is very clear that salvation is a work of Grace you can't do anything to earn it all you do is place your faith in Christ lifting your hands getting water baptized or speaking in tongues will not make you a Christian so these people were saved and then they immediately were baptized in the Holy Spirit see you can be saved and immediately baptized in the Holy Spirit understand the baptism of the holy spirit is not about spiritual maturity there are people baptized in the holy spirit that are still babes in Christ but it is the second experience for every Christian to receive power to be a witness come on how many of y'all know we could use more power and more boldness and more of God anybody else in here but me could know we can use some more power more of God more boldness I know that I can and so how do you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit I want to share that with you in closing how to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit number one is this ask God to baptize you in the Holy Spirit ask God to baptize you in the Holy Spirit look what Luke 11 13 says it says if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him we serve a good good father he's a father that wants to baptize you in the Holy Spirit he wants to give you good gifts he wants to give you power to be a witness he wants to give you more of the Holy he is not trying to withhold from you but if you will ask there is so much more that he wants to give and that he wants to do in your life and so ask ask your father ask God to baptize you in the Holy Spirit number two worship and magnify God when I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit I was worshiping and I was just praying I was just lost in his presence I was pursuing I just blocked everything out and it was just me of God I just wanted more I didn't understand it all it didn't all make sense some of you might be sitting in here like I sat in some services like oh what's about to happen up in here about to be some fire falling down here a rushing wind listen there want none of that I mean there was an ax but in my experience I just wanted more I wanted more of God I said I don't even understand it all but I want more and if you have it for me I want it I want all of it I want every gift not just I want the gift of heal like I just I want all that you have for me and so worship God lift up your hands lift your heart to the Lord lift your voice surrender press in and then by faith receive the Holy Spirit by faith you're like I don't know if I could do that you receive salvation how'd you receive it by faith by faith you believed in Jesus as your Lord and Savior by faith you were saved and so by faith receive the Holy Spirit the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please God and so by faith receive and then number four ask God to continually fill you with the Holy Spirit we're gonna have a moment here in just a little bit to press into God but I want to encourage you don't don't know how to stop at a moment in church every day in your morning devotions in your car press in late at night when you're waking up and you just can't go to sleep continually ask God to fill you with your Holy Spirit you can't filled with too much some of you you were filled before but you've gotten dry and weary ask him to fill you again Ephesians 5 18 it says do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery instead be filled with the spirit come on you need to keep being filled with the Holy Spirit and so that you don't drift into lukewarmness some of you you've gotten lukewarm and you need to ask the Holy Spirit to come and fill you again you need to ask God to baptize ties you in the Holy Spirit you got to be taking spiritual next steps ask them to feel you God fill me fill me with Power Fill Me To Be A Witness so I can be a witness to my family a witness to my neighbors a witness to my co-workers a witness at the grocery store a witness on the ball fields God fill me so I can be a a witness at my church I believe the holy spirit is going to speak to you about serving and joining the Dream Team so that you can have power and boldness to be a witness come on let God fill you up so he can pour you out let him fill you up so he can pour you out could we just stand right now to stand with me come on would you stand stand all across this room

caramel brule latte oh this week i finally got my first caramel brule latte so that is about the only hot drink i like from starbucks other than that it's a nice but it got my attention and i made sure i got a caramel brule latte you know what else got my attention a couple days ago at night i am driving down the street and there is this house decked out with christmas lights i mean christmas lights they got inflate christmas inflatables i'm like is it is too early for that y'all yes i am one of those folks the christmas stuff does not go up in my house until the day after thanksgiving all right confession time how many already got your tree up you're like hey my tree is up have my tree been up since february i know so you like that tree but my family knows this about me and they try

dog the tree's not up nothing else is up and they went after the dog poor peanut is an accomplice i said it don't matter we're still not putting up the tree until the day after thanksgiving it got my attention you know what grabs jesus's attention is always interesting matthew chapter 14 verse 13 through 15. it says when jesus heard what had happened he had heard that john the baptist had been beheaded it's as he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place hearing of this the crowds followed him on foot from the towns and the bible says jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat and he said he had compassion on them and healed their sick jesus saw the crowd and he had compassion on them see whatever gets your attention gets your affection whatever gets your attention gets your affection the crowd grabbed his attention and so he wanted to help them people always grabbed jesus's attention the sick got jesus attention the poor got his attention the needy got his attention the lost got his attention prostitutes got his attention tax collectors got his attention you see this over and over and over again with jesus when you read the gospels people got his attention look at matthew 9 36 it says when he saw the crowds he had compassion he they got his attention so they got his affection and mark 6 34 it says when jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd so he began teaching them many things luke 7 13 it says when the lord saw her she got his attention his heart overflowed with compassion don't cry he said john 11 33 it says when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who had come along with her also weeping he was deeply moved what got his attention got his affection he was deeply moved in the spirit and troubled in verse 35 it's where it goes on to say that jesus wept with him people always grabbed jesus's attention so they had his affection let me ask you today what's grabbing your attention see so many things want your attention career school teachers professors coaches bosses commercials some social media so many things are vying for your attention parents tell their kids pay attention our attention is is a currency and whatever you pay attention to will get your affection does god have your attention or does the world have your attention do the things of the earth have your attention or do the things of heaven have your attention what has your attention gets your affection and god wants your attention let's talk about how we give god our attention number one is this give your attention to god's priorities give your attention to god's priorities look what colossians chapter 3 verse 2 says it says think about the things of heaven not the things of earth are you thinking about the things of heaven are you thinking about loving god serving god honoring god sharing your faith sharing your resources helping others or are you so focused on earth that you don't think about the things of heaven look at matthew 16 23 it says jesus turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the concerns of god but merely human concerns see some of you today you need to tell your thought life get behind me satan because your things are the things on your mind are the things of the earth not the things of god you got to tell your flesh get behind me because you don't have in mind the concerns of god you're earthly minded instead of the heavenly minded your time your talents and your treasures aren't focused on god and reaching the lost and hurting people and helping people to know god and if that's you today if your attention is on the wrong you got to say get behind me satan get behind me flesh to give god your attention number two you have to give your life to god's priorities for your attention to be on god you got to give your life to god's priorities and we're going to look at a story today for the rest of this message that that's going to just shape and help us see how we can give god our attention matthew chapter 14 verse 15 through 17. it says that evening the disciples came to him and said this is a remote place and it's already getting like jesus been teaching for a long time there's a massive crowds there and then the disciples had recognized and realized man i think these folks are starting to get a little hungry and they say send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves but jesus said that isn't necessary you feed them imagine jesus is ministering the crowd it's massive people are hanging on every word but it is getting later and later and later and the disciples are watching like man i don't think jesus realized these people are hungry i think maybe the disciples were getting a little hungry and it's getting late they're like geez you got to send these people away so they can get something to eat and she said no no you feed them they're like well what jesus i mean there's no mcdonald's around here there's no chick-fil-a like there's nothing we are in a remote place like we got to send them back to their village they're like jesus what are you what are you talking about we can't help these people they're probably thinking you're jesus you could look we just got a couple loaves and some fish like lord you could made it rain long john silver's in this place for everybody to eat what are you talking about us feed them but no that's not what jesus said he said you feed them listen i don't want you to miss this god wants to use you he could have fed them all but he wants to use you and he wants to use me but one of the reasons oftentimes that god isn't able to use you or to me is because we make excuses and we have the choice we have to get over our excuses and we have to make ourselves available to god the disciples they had some good excuses matthew 14 17. they said but jesus they're there's five thousand men that don't even include the women and the children but we only have five loaves of bread and two fish they answered see jesus we only have a little bread a little fish our little won't feed all these people and one of the biggest reasons we don't make ourselves available to god is because we think our little won't do much what i have is way too little for god to use other people can do something ridiculous for god but i can't all i have is a little just i can't you i got a little faith my faith is little i got little ability little talent little energy little money little thinking little time there must be somebody else god wants to use but listen i want you to know with god little isn't less god says listen if you will give me your little oh let me tell you something if you will give me your little you can do a lot with your little see ridiculous faith is moving forward when you only have a little ridiculous faith is moving forward even when you have good excuses not to i'll give god all kinds of excuses when god was calling me i'm like god i've only been saved five months like are you okay i don't know anything about that i can't be a pastor there's no way i've only been a christian if i'm making excuses about my i'm an introvert pastors need to be extra there's no way i can be an effective i put my extrovert on sunday just so y'all know but by nature and heart i'm an introvert i give all my extrovert to you on sunday and then i go home and i hit i mean i'm just out i'm done i'm out of words but but i'm like how in the world am i gonna be a pastor and be effective when i'm an introvert those guys sometimes guys have spoken to me about giving and giving generously and i'm like god we can't do we're looking at our bills and we're we're looking at our finances and god said i want you to give this and i'm like god are you i think you're talking to somebody else not us man i'm telling you i can be good at giving god excuses we all can be good god doesn't want our excuses he wants our little he says give me your little give your life to god's priority what gets your attention get your affection god wants our attention number three let's talk about how god gets our attention number three is give your resources to god's priorities give your resources to god's priorities matthew 14 17 18 but we only have five loaves of bread and two fish to answer bring them here he said see jesus always wants us to bring our life bring our heart bring our talents our time bring our resources and give them to him see there are two choices you can keep your reese's resources in your hand or you can put your resources in god's hands if you keep them in your hand you only get what you can produce but if you put them in god's hands you get what god can produce in your hands you get your blessings in god's hands you get his blessings let me ask you will you keep them in your hands or where you place them in god's hands i want you to see what happens when you put your resources you put your little when you put it in god's hands number one is this when you give your resources to god first he blesses them matthew 14 19. he said bring them here he said that in verse 18 and then in verse 19 it says then he told the people to sit down on the grass and jesus took the five loaves and two fish he looked up toward heaven and blessed them the disciples gave the bread and fish to jesus before they ate any of it or before they gave any to the people and the bible said jesus blessed them listen this is so so important always give your resources to god first and he'll bless them god give them to god first and he'll bless them see so many people's resources aren't blessed because they give their resources to others first instead of god first they give them first a mastercard visa rent a house payment they give them first to a car payment restaurant coffee shop they give them first to family friends their favorite charity organization but if you give them to god first what god does is he will bless your resources and your life look what malachi chapter 3 verse 10 says it says bring the whole tithe tithe is referring to 10 of your income we need to bring all of it to god and we need to bring all of it to him first get them out of your hands and get them into god's hands just like god said to the disciples he's saying bring them to me bring them here and i'll bless them it says bring the whole tithe into the storehouse the storehouse is the local church that there may be food in my house and then look what god says he says test me in this says the lord oh god the lord god almighty god says test me listen will you test me if you'll test me and watch me put a blessing on your resources when you give them to me first he's saying test me try me here at people's church we have the the 90-day tithe challenge and all it is is an opportunity for you to test god that if you'll sign up for the 90-day tithe challenge and you tithe for 90 days and you don't feel that god has blessed you call the church and we'll refund all the money you gave it's a money-back guarantee to test god and try you can go on our our people's church app you can go on the website fill out that that 90-day tithe challenge but test him start tithing today for the next 90 days test god and he will bless your life he says test me in this try me says the lord almighty and see if i will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing blessing on your family blessing on your relationships blessing on your career blessing on your children blessing on your finances blessing on your health blessing on your mind see if i won't pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it listen when you make heaven your priority heaven makes you its priority when you make god your priority by giving your tithe first and god will make you his priority and he will bless your resources and your life check out this testimony video since i was a child i've always felt like my mom and i and my family have struggled financially i mean as long as i can remember you'd have to ask my grandfather help cover things and at a certain point he passed away i remember feeling that like that shake in our finances even more because we don't have his financial assistance when i was a kid that was my first kind of encounter of tithing and it was me seeing you know people just take a couple dollars out of their purse and putting in the basket i just thought it was something that you kind of did just give a little bit to the church so i got older and started really getting um interested in pursuing god and reading the word for myself then it started to transform into you know more of what it should have been so i started tithing um as a young adult i would say is when i really got serious about it i started earning my own income and so things got a little bit better for a while my mother was diagnosed with cancer so getting that news it was terrible for us and so during that time i took on her finances and that was a lot for me gotten behind on bills out of fear of not knowing how i pay for this how i would do that i stopped tithing i tried to manage the situations myself doing that was me not trusting god when i stopped tithing things definitely got worse me keeping that temperature to myself didn't solve anything finances were so bad over the years where i was struggling to get my basic necessities my husband and i had already we already had three children very pregnant um needed another car this was during a pandemic so money was already tight it there was no sign of any of that improving um relationally things were getting worse they had already been bad you know in a lot of different areas getting a divorce was never part of my plans and that was probably the lowest point for me and that was november of 2020. i took ownership of the conviction that i felt to tithe like actually this is not a question you felt this on your heart for a while now's the time to do it and so i didn't start doing it at a time where it was comfortable for me i didn't start tithing when it was like okay now i'm good i can spare that 10 i started doing it when i was like i really cannot when i began that it was the start of obedience that was the first month that i was able to begin providing for my children and myself in one that i hadn't and forever god repeatedly showed himself i created a baby registry for a while there not a lot of things were purchased and then one day i went on and it said my registry have been completely purchased my community group leader they had actually gotten together the girls in the group and purchased my whole registry when i tell you i cried i cried i began to feel a peace that i had not felt in so long i began to feel an excitement for the future financially emotionally relationally he has provided everything that i've needed everything that my kids have needed over and over again because i'm allowing him to bless me i think me not tithing was me hindering the blessings that he wanted to give me test him just take the step and just start doing it you're hearing this testimony you'll have one of your own come on can we thank god what a powerful testimony when you give to god first he blesses it proverbs 3 9-10 it says honor the lord with your wealth with the first fruits not the last fruits not the leftover fruits not the mid fruits the first god says will you trust me give me the first fruits of all your crops it says then your barns will be filled to overflowing and your vats will bring over with new wine put what you have in god's hands first and god will bless your resources in your life when you put it in god's hands first he blesses it number two when you give away what god gives to you god multiplies it let's look back at the story matthew 14 verses 19 through it says then he told the people to sit down on the grass jesus took the five loaves and two fish and he looked up towards heaven and blessed them then breaking the loaves into pieces he gave the bread to the disciples notice he gave it back to them who distributed to the people the bible says they all ate as much as they wanted and afterwards the disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftovers about 5 000 men were fed that day in addition to all the women and children the disciples they took the blessed bread they put it in god's hands first he blessed it he gave it back to them and they took the blessed bread and the blessed fish they didn't eat it they gave them away and it multiplied listen you you can't miss this think about this if the disciples would have gave away the bread and fish before they gave it to jesus it never would have multiplied we would not have the story of jesus feeding five thousand we would have the story of the disciples feeding five to ten because they didn't give it to jesus first and it ran out it multiplied because they gave it to jesus first think about this if they would have took the blessed bread they gave it to jesus burke they gave it to jesus first and then they got the blessed bread and fish and they would have kept it for themselves it never would have multiplied and blessed the people i wish i could have been there for this story i wish i could have been there where the awkwardness where jesus is like you feed them well jesus we only got well we got a little like a couple matter of fact we took some of this from a little boy poor little boy don't got his lunch anymore we just got a couple five loaves and two he's bringing to me can you ima i just wish i they gave it to him and they see him bless it and he breaks it and he gives it back to them all right give it to the people jesus you think breaking into a couple pieces is going to help us feed all these people here feed them i wish i could i would just i wish i could have seen them as as as they started to hand out pieces and say hey can i get two man can i get an extra pizza hey man hey hey hey i don't even know how i'm gonna feed 20. you can't be asking for extra pieces you know what i mean i just imagine as they're going and i don't know at what point it happened but this is what i know it did not multiply in their hand it multiplied as they were giving it away and i don't know when it did oh but i they knew i know peter was john john was like peter it just keeps coming and it's just multiplying and man i bet they went back to those hey man i'm sorry i'm sorry yeah you can you could have some more yeah my bad because the bible says they ate until they were full you said they ate as much as they wanted to and so they were going around oh the mirror walking back i mean i'm so sorry my bad jesus my bae you say feed them i'm feeding them what do you need well i got a nickel in my pot i mean i'll give you whatever i got and they're going and they're walking and they're feeding and then they're like all right all right guys oh look looks like we got a a little some left over and so come on let's gather up what we have left i got my friends there to come out here and help me right now and so they're going they're feeding everybody and then they got leftovers they're collecting the leftovers and they're like man you got to be kidding me we not only fed 5 000 plus people but we got 12 baskets left over started with five pieces of bread two loaves fed thousands and we got 12 left over i would love to know what jesus if i was jesus i would have had a look on my face like jesus is better than me i wish i could see his their face what a miracle because they won they brought it didn't make excuses he said bring him here actually they did make excuses but they didn't stop with their excuses they brought him he blessed it he then gave it back they didn't eat it they didn't keep it they gave it away and as they gave it away it multiplied and they sat there with 12 baskets i mean it might have been just church right then you know what i mean just let me just cry just gee i mean manny blessed it listen what we give away multiplies let me show this to you it's powerful look at second corinthians chapter 9 verse 10 11 it says now he who supplies seed to the sower now see to the taker seed to the sower see everything god blesses you with isn't for you to keep some of it is seed that god wants you to sow to bless others and when you sow it god gives seed to the sower god multiplies what you give away it says now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your storage of seed god really wants us to understand how our resources are multiplied so he says it again he says i'll increase your store of seed don't eat your seed sow your seed to bless others and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness it says you will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to god god wants to bless us so that we can be a blessing to others god wants us to sow our seed and give our seed so that he can multiply it so that we can be blessed on every occasion so that we then can also or excuse me so that we can be a blessing on every occasion listen god wants to keep helping hurting kids in haiti and prisoners that are behind bars and the single mom who's struggling and give backpacks and school supplies to kids in need and give under-resourced family christmas presents and help the person addicted to drugs and help the homeless person and help send missionaries around the world and help do outreach in our communities and he wants to do it through us we have been blessed so that we can bless others and so he multiplies what we give away so that we can keep helping others second corinthians 9 6 it says remember this whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously god multiplies what you give away the amount of seed you sow will determine your amount of harvest the amount you give away will determine the amount god multiplies back to you luke 6 38 it says give and it will be given to you a good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap for with the measure you use it will be measured to you god multiplies what you give away and the question isn't can god get it to you the question is can god get it through you can god get it through you you're a blessing you're blessed to be a blessing proverbs 11 24 it says one person gives freely yet gains even more another withholds unduly but comes to poverty god always multiplies what you give away god keeps blessing us so that we can keep being a blessing to others jamie and i we've always tithed oh always tithe we give to god first it's his we want his blessing on our life and our family we want the windows of heaven open so we've always been tithers but then over and above our tithe we give you can't give god we just give and we have seen as we give generously god just multiplies in miraculous ways the same way he did with the five loaves and then the two fish and even right now as we're in this giving season as jamie and i are preparing to give to dreambuilders making our 2021-2022 commitment god has asked us to give this year more than we've ever given before that at the miracle offering we're going to write the largest check we've ever written before to dream builders and we just know we can't out give god it's all his we know his blessing is on it and god has given us seed not for us to eat not for us to keep to our listen he's giving us bread the bread's what we eat when we pay our bills but god has blessed us with seed so that we can sow and be a blessing to others and so we're stepping out in faith again this year and listen would you go on a journey with you god wants to use you he wants to get it through you god wants to do a miracle in your life and next sunday is commitment sunday if you're new today to people's church listen we aren't asking anything from you we simply want you know we're a church with big

A9zmFm7xV-A,amen people search uh so good to be with you we love this place I just want to give you a quick testimony so we are only two weeks into our school year it's our second year on campus at IUPUI as Chi Alpha and um within that first two weeks we've already had 10 commitments to Christ which is just incredible for us that's like just about as many as we had all of last year right and at our first service on campus we had 85 college students show up for that service so we're just really pumped our staff and our student leaders that have gone through our train they're just doing a killer job making disciples in small groups and so we're just so thankful for what the Lord's doing there thank you for your partnering with us and helping us reach that University amen um okay so just by a quick show of hands how many of you at least at once in your life have had a bad haircut just just got a bad haircut how many of you know that's a tough thing to shake right because sometimes there's not a lot you can do about it now you're stuck for a while right I want to tell you by the time I got a bad haircut um so what some of you know maybe not all of you Pastor Chris is my brother-in-law his wife Jamie who is leading worship this morning is my younger sister um and for three years Pastor Chris and I were roommates at bible college together we went to this Bible school called CBC Central Bible College in Springfield Missouri and we were roommates and some of you may not know this but he was an active singer and he and I formed a worship band while we were in college and for the summer between my Junior and Senior year we went ahead and traveled to Christian Youth Camps leading worship for the week and so he was the singer I was the drummer and uh we all gathered together in Kansas City Missouri because we were getting ready to do a camp in the northern part of Missouri and so we wanted to rehearse make sure we were really sharp and all that kind of stuff and so we're at our base player's parents house and his mom goes hey before any of you hit the road if any of you want a free haircut you know I'm down and I was just like oh man I want a haircut because here's the deal like the joke at Central Bible College they used to call it central Bridal College right it was like you're going to go there and you're going to find your wife well I'm about to go in my senior year I still haven't even had a steady girlfriend yet right and so I'm like I know enough about these camps that I know other college teams are there to represent other universities and I'm like I'll get a fresh haircut I might meet my wife from from some other school at one of these camps you know and someone's like it's gonna be awesome and Chris he pulls me to the side and he was like bro don't do it and I was like why he's like first of all you don't even know if she can cut here you haven't seen her give anyone a haircut you don't even know if she's any good and I was like it can't be that bad he's like I wouldn't risk it like that and I was like no no and I'd like I was in the moment right you ever been in one of those moments where you're like I'm in I can't step away I'm emotionally invested she's already got the Clippers out the stool is said I'd be like I gotta go through with it now but now I'm nervous right and so I'm sitting in the store we're in her living room and the way their living room is set up it's like everyone's living room is set the same way all our furniture faces the TV right and so I'm in a stool at the edge of the living room and Chris is sitting on a couch and I'm just giving you the the side view okay so I'm over there Chris is on the couch and every once in a while Christmas does one of these foreign like that now I don't have a mirror in front of me so I don't know what he's seeing but how many of you know I'm nervous I'm like really nervous because at this point like I really cared about my hair back then I used to rock this bald fade it looks so good right and so I just want to say I just want to fade right and so she's doing it and Chris just keeps giving me these looks and I'm like oh man how bad is it and so then like she turns her back like you know to like do this kind of thing across the front you know she's doing like that and I could see him behind her he's like like that like what is happening right now so I get done and I go up to Chris before I can even go to the bathroom like how bad is it he's like bro I'm gonna give it to you straight okay how many this is what I appreciate about your pastor he's an honest person okay he was like it looks like someone shaved a cow's butt and then plopped it on your head crooked it was like it was already bad you said cow's butt plopped and then he was like crooked it was like no I go to the bathroom I look in the mirror listen how many of you know a fade is supposed to have a gradual blend right no I had a hard line y'all it looked like a chili bowl haircut but he wasn't lying it was like it wasn't like this it was like this right and so that was that moment right there that I learned I could rock this look so I was like well I guess I'm going with the buzz cut that's how we're gonna roll this year and uh still didn't meet it my wife there so that's you know it's fine praise the Lord there are always voices in our lives that are speaking to us and at that moment Chris was the voice in my life that I should have been listening to right but instead I was listening to the wrong voice there are always voices in our lives some voices telling us what we need to do some voice is telling us that what we shouldn't do and the decision that we make on what voice to listen to is critical listen more than a bad haircut the decisions you make determine the outcome of your life and so you got to pay attention to the right voice and so the Bible says that we're given a guide a guide that will speak to us the right things to do and that God is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will guide you and lead you he will be the voice that we need in our lives Galatians chapter 5 verses 16-17 so I say let the holy spirit guide your lives then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves the sinful nature wants to do evil which is just the opposite of what the spirit wants and the spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires these two forces are constantly fighting each other so you are not free to carry out your good intentions you can be sure that God wants to bless you as a matter of fact I believe God's default posture is one of blessing but unfortunately a lot of Christians miss those blessings due to following the wrong voices because just because you have the Holy Spirit in you doesn't mean he's ultimately guiding you because you have to surrender your life to his guidance you have to be listening to his voice the holy spirit is not going to force you to do anything you have to choose to listen to that voice that's why it says in Galatians that if you allow the holy spirit to guide you then you won't do what your sinful nature craves the Holy Spirit wants to lead us but he's not going to force us to be led by him therefore it is possible for Christians to be led by other voices other than the Holy Spirit and let me tell you this those voices can be dangerous and so I want to give you three voices that we often listen to that we should reject and instead listen to the holy spirit so the first voice is this the voice of the flesh Galatians 5 17 the sinful nature wants to do evil how many of you know the voice of the flesh is loud right it is Relentless I wish it went away after I got saved but it is constantly fighting for my attention it wants to distract me to tempt me to discourage me it wants me to focus on fleshly desires self-centeredness personal Comfort he wants me to allow my feelings and my thoughts to rule my life it tells me that whatever feels good I can do it's like Josh it's your way right away all day every day like literally and how my mind works it's like it's like a song your way all day every day every day oh no does your mind work like that my mind puts everything to rhymes but in a very Caucasian way it lacks it lacks just a little bit of Rhythm you know what I'm saying so but it's it's always wanting to lead my life and that's dangerous because no matter how spiritual you are the voice of the flesh is always calling out you see in Scripture Adam after he sins he's afraid the flesh starts to cry out and says you should hide from God because he's angry he wants to punish you and so Adam hides the good news is what's the truth God even in Adam's sin God didn't hide from him he came looking for him when he was hiding because your sin is not too big for God and he's not going to turn away from you he's always looking for you right and so then you see other places in scripture right we have Esau he's hungry he listens to the voice of the Flesh and he sells his Birthright Elijah coming off a big win he all of a sudden feels tired the voice of the flesh says you know what your life is going nowhere you should just end it right it wants him to take his own life David full of lust listens to the voice of the flesh he steals a man's wife has an affair and then has that husband killed right the voice of the flesh it's a it's a voice we need to ignore and beware of Proverbs 14 12 it says you may think you are on the right Road and still end up dead you got to ignore the voice of the Flesh and you know just this is just a side note right this is just this me talking to you this morning one of the reasons also you should ignore the voice of the flesh is because the voice of the flesh is not you it's a foreign voice see here's the deal when you gave your life to Jesus it says behold all old things have passed away and all things have now been made new Paul says I no longer live but Christ in me the hope of glory see when you become a Believer the flesh is not your identity anymore a child of God Is So when you start to give the voice of the flesh room in your life you're allowing something that is not you to make you believe that you're that but you're not that anymore right listen people walk around they go I'm just a sinner saved by grace it sounds awesome but that's not who you are because you gave your life to Jesus and John the Baptist says Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world you are not that identity anymore does that mean we sin yes but it's not me that's not who I am I will not align with my behaviors I will align with my identity in Christ that's who you are man that means that the flesh which was killed at the cross in Christ has no right to be a voice in your life anymore when you give the flesh a voice in your life and Obey it you are acting contrary to your identity not more like it that's not who you are anymore so when the flesh starts to speak you know what you need to do you need to talk to it like a 90s high school girl and be like poof be gone how many of you remember the 90s you want to know why I know that phrase so well because girls would tell it to me poof be gone right that's what you need to do to the voice of the flesh so get out of here the second voice we need to ignore is the voice of the world this could be any people places or things that are speaking what is contrary to the voice of God anything or anyone that causes you to listen to a voice or take a path other than the path that God has for you and it can seem harmless and usually does but if you listen closely you'll realize it's a dangerous voice and what makes it dangerous is the fact that it's getting you to focus on the wrong things which in turn causes you to lose direction and your Divine Purpose right you gotta ignore those voices let me give you an illustration for my personal life so after Bible College I served as a youth pastor in Ohio for two years and I had the ability to come back to Indiana to join a church plant with the guy who led me to Jesus and so I was like yeah let's do that but if if church when you start a church there's no money so it's not like hey come here you got a job it was like no come here go get a job and do this for free right and so I did all kinds of odd ends and things I was helping flip houses I was selling drums at Sam Ash Music Store like whatever I could do and then finally landed for FedEx and this is right at the time where they bought all of Kinko's copies do you remember this and they became FedEx Kinkos right and I was working in sales for them and my job was to go to all of our print clients that had like big print jobs like really huge ones and then get them to ship all of their stuff with FedEx right and so that's what I had to do I had to drum up that business and what what brought attention to my management team was I signed a contract this is going to date me with Singular Wireless anyone remember Singular Wireless right and this is right at the time they came out was called the Firefly phone this was like this little phone that could only have three numbers on it that you would give to your kids right they could only receive they couldn't make calls and they they had all of these flyers they needed to go Nationwide to all their stores and I landed that contract and the management team was like you're going places Josh we're going to put you in the management track and we're going to have you become a store manager and they were expanding at this point they had just opened up their Branch at Pendleton Pike and so there was a plan I had a trajectory and right at the height of that training when I was like I'm gonna be a manager the pastor comes he's like we want to bring you on full time for a whole lot less money and I remember like yes I'm in when I went to go have that conversation with my district manager he was like what are you thinking like he's thinking like a business person in the world he's not he's not a Believer and he was like what are they going to pay you it's chump change you're gonna have a good life if you stay here and I'm like let's say I know this may not make sense I remember how this conversation I'm like I feel like God has put this calling on my life and this is what I'm supposed to do so that's what I'm going to do I am resigning in two weeks I'm out of here right and the thing is what had what would have happened in my life if I had listened to the voice of the world that said Chase the money chase the house Chase the cars chase the notoriety listen I I'm I'm not incredibly wealthy as far as Americans consider wealth right but at the same time I have lived an adventurous life and can I tell you no paycheck no paycheck does as much for me as standing in a classroom at IUPUI and saying is there anyone here would like to commit their life to Jesus and see hands go up in the air that's the life and that's only possible because the holy spirit said I know what I have for you ignore that voice and listen to mine and he leads you in an amazing Direction and so you got to listen to him first John 2 16 for everything in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life comes not from the father but from the world if the voice you are listening to is telling you to pursue whatever you want regardless of what God has to say about it then you're listening to the wrong voice the Third is the voice of the devil El Diablo even as a Christian if you're not careful you will find yourself listening to the devil and buying his lies John 8 44 he has always hated the truth because there is no truth in him when he lies it is consistent with his character for he is a liar and the father of Lies the devil is going to say things to you like did God really say listen it's just this once it's going to be okay right that's the stuff he's going to say he's going to tempt you with rationalization excuses and lies that prevent us from dealing with the behaviors that are hurting us and others around us and if we're being honest some of the reason we don't deal with these behaviors is because we feel trapped we feel trapped in hurt feelings and shame and embarrassment and pride and anger and self-justification and in that feeling of being trapped the Devil comes in and he whispers to us God can't help you because this is who you are he's going to tell you that you're beyond forgiveness that you've done too much and that you are too much but the devil is a liar don't listen to his voice don't flirt with it don't entertain it don't give him space in your life because here is the truth you are loved by God and there is nothing you can do about it he just loves you you are adopted into the family of God through Jesus and you have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the Heavenly Realms is what the scripture says therefore you have purpose and Destiny that is incredible your identity in Christ is unshakable and the Holy Spirit in you is powerful so quit listening to a defeated devil that has no hope or a future listen to the voice of the holy spirit that gives you hope and a future you don't have to listen to dangerous voices you can follow the voice of the Holy Spirit he wants to guide you and lead you into the blessed life that God has for you he wants to guide you and lead you into your unshakable identity in Christ look at this in Romans 8 14. for all who are led by the spirit of God are children of God that's your identity right there you are a child of God Jesus modeled being led by the spirit even when it's difficult in Luke 4 1 Jesus full of the Holy Spirit left the Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness now I don't know what comes to your mind when you think of wilderness but when I used to read this the first thing that came to my mind was the Pacific Northwest I see giant Evergreens right and you're like he's in the wilderness no it's the Middle East y'all it's a desert okay and that's not an easy place to be that's not an easy setup to be in for the devil to come in and tempt you but the Holy Spirit led him to a place where his identity was concreted and cemented in that wilderness he led him there to help reveal who he is right in the Father's Love and so listen the Holy Spirit just because you surrender your life to him doesn't mean everything in your life is going to be seamless and easy there are going to be times where it's difficult but it's because he's developing something in you that you would never get to have you not walked through that difficult time I have any people that like to work out in here right okay don't raise your hand if only been once okay we like to work out how many of you know like if you go to the gym and you work out and your muscles are sore the next day if you're like man that hurts weights are heavy I'm not going back all you did was experience the pain with none of the blessing but when you walk through that tough time and you discipline yourself to go back and back and back then you start to see the blessing that comes from the pain there's so many people they walk through difficult times and their immediate posture is well God I don't know what he's doing this is messed up I forget I quit and when you quit you walk through the pain but none of the blessing stay faithful to him he's faithful to you and he'll get you to where you need to be you with me this morning the holy spirit will lead us away from the traps of the enemy and into the will of God John 16 13 when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak on his own authority but whatever he hears he will speak and he will declare to you the things that are to come I know you want to be led by the Holy Spirit I believe that's true but the next question and it makes sense is Josh exactly how do I do that how do I allow my life to be guided by the Holy Spirit the first way is this realize that he speaks through his word second Timothy 3 16-17 all scripture is God breathed and useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work this is the number one way the holy spirit is going to speak to you so many of us are like holy spirit speak to me and he's like I did it's right there you just got to read it it's right there when you read the Bible you are learning God's heart and understanding his will Psalm 119 verse 105 your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path listen take the scripture read it meditate on it hide it in your heart apply it to your life it will guide you as a student a parent or a spouse it will show you how to handle your work your relationships your money and the ups and downs of life here is why I want you to read your Bibles hear my heart it is not read your Bible or you're a bad person it's not that it's the devil's going to come at you with everything he's got he's not trying to slow down the only weapon you have is that think about it when Jesus is in the wilderness every time Satan comes at him what does Jesus do he quotes scripture but you know you can't quote something you've never read if it's not in here it's not going to come out of here and so this isn't con this isn't condemnation this isn't judgment you bad Christian read your Bible this is I want you to be Victorious and successful so you got to get this in you so you know how to fight so when the Devil comes at you and he goes you know what you're so you're so filthy God's abandoned you you can say no God says to me he will never leave me or forsake me but you can't quote it unless you know it you understand what I'm saying you need it in you to live a Victorious Life but so many of us the Satan's coming at us with like actual Sabers and we're fighting with these Toys R Us Walmart toy department lightsabers like and it's just like you have a powerful weapon foreign it's in the Bible you just got to use it read it hide it in your heart it is a discipline but it's a discipline worth having right it's so helpful so he speaks to you through his word and then number two he speaks directly to your heart under understand that the holy spirit will speak directly to our hearts at times but it will never contradict what he tells us in the scripture can I tell you where I see this the most especially in campus ministry it's normally a college guy comes up to me and he'll be like yo Josh here's the deal I was praying the other day the Lord spoke to me I don't know why when people say the Lord speak like also you gotta get a face and like it's like super heavy super deep right I don't the Holy Spirit don't speak to me like that he's not like Josh I don't know what's going on there but anyway they're like he spoke to me and he said listen that girl looks sitting across the room supposed to be your wife I'm telling you the Lord's telling me this is it and it'll always be like this right like because they're obviously not a fit like anyone looking from the outside you're like you don't work at all right but the most obvious would be this like hey you've committed your life to Jesus right yeah absolutely you love him you're Christian you're following them yeah absolutely I know for fact she's not a Christian she doesn't want anything to do with Jesus and I'm not saying she won't at some point but she doesn't right now and scripture does say you shouldn't be unequally yoked yeah but the Lord told me it has to be like no he told you here you just don't like what you're hearing so a lot of times what we want to do is we want to say well God said as like our Abracadabra on whatever we want to do but can I tell you anytime you say the Lord said something he never said that's actually what it means to take the lord's name in vain when you use it as your magic Elixir to let you do whatever you want to do in the flesh right come on well I could but I shouldn't right here so make sure that yes he does speak to your heart but he's not going to contradict what he's already said in his word there are times God will speak to your heart though and he can do it in one of four ways go through these quickly number one he can whisper he did this to Elijah in First Kings 19. but can I tell you you're never going to hear the whisper of God's voice if your life is full of noise you got to silence the noise people in our culture have to learn how to take a Sabbath put their phones away get off social media and just sit in the presence of God and let him talk to you right whisper he also speaks to us through a piece that's when you're praying about a decision and asking God to lead you and as you're in his presence a strong peace comes over you about a certain direction he also speaks through a check in your spirit as you pray and you're seeking Godly counsel something just doesn't feel right right don't ignore that and the last one is prophetically God supernaturally speaks to you in a dream or through a brother or sister in Christ and I want to take just a moment to bring some kind of teaching to this because what I want you to understand is prophecy it's a thing it's in scripture First Corinthians 12 14 Romans 12 it's a gift of the Holy Spirit but what it is not is Christian fortune telling it's not what it is it's not hey you're kind of perfect like can you tell me what my future is that's not how it works it's also not God speaking to someone to call out your secret sins that's not what God's doing anymore he says the gifts of the Spirit are meant to edify and encourage a word from God spoken prophetic prophetic prophecy is nothing more than when God speaks to someone to give you a message and it should encourage you that's how it should feel okay but here's the deal if it's the first time you've ever heard that word don't do nothing with it as a matter of fact prophecy should only confirm what the Lord's already speaking to you in your life so you might come and be like I have a word for you brother right and you tell me and I'm like that's great I never heard that before I'm just going to sit on that I'm not doing anything with it but if you tell me something the Lord's already been speaking to me that I'm like I'll take that as an affirmation so let me tell you how this worked in our life so for 13 years we passed her to church in Fishers Indiana somewhere around year 11 I get asked to speak for a Chi Alpha fall retreat for their chapter at Missouri State University it was electric it was amazing the experience we had the services were incredible people were being healed freed from things it was a powerful the next morning I get up I leave our cabin I go hike into the woods I sit by a peaceful stream to do my morning devotions and I feel like the Lord starts speaking to me when I say the Lord speaks to me it's not like the skies split open and he's like Josh like that's not like anytime people were like the Lord spoke to me it's really let's be honest it's like this inner you just feel it and you know it's him and he was like Josh prepare yourself because I'm about to change everything you know about Ministry now at this season I have been praying for the church I was pastoring to make a cultural shift towards being a more missionally minded Church what I mean by that is this that we wouldn't be just thinking about how do we get people in our building but we would be thinking about how do we live for Jesus in our neighborhoods to our neighbors and I was when I hear that I was like that's it that's what's about to happen this whole church is about to shift this is awesome because how many of you know the Lord speaks but then we want to take his word and make it work with what we want and so I hike back to our cabin I'm like I got to tell Danny I can't wait to tell her what the Lord spoke to me and and she tells me she says listen I couldn't sleep last night because the lord gave me a dream and in the dream I was pregnant but it wasn't a physical pregnancy it was a spiritual one and he said you and Josh are about to birth something brand new in your ministry this is all within five minutes I'm like Lord I'm here for it and again I'm still thinking about my church and then I get a knock at our door and it's the director of that Chi Alpha who's my best friend from college and Andy says I can't shake this feeling that I'm supposed to challenge you with something and I said what is it he said I need you to pray about whether or not you're supposed to resign your church and do this full-time and I was like uh I don't think that's it and he said I've never asked you this as a best friend but I am going to put this on you commit to me as my best friend that you'll at least give the month of October to pray and fast on it the Lord doesn't want you to do it it's not going to happen so I said okay we'll pray it fast on it so we're doing that one obstacle we had to have out of the way we had too much school debt from our school loans for it to make sense for us to be missionaries and I looked at it here's my Apostle I'm like Lord if you want me to do this this is your problem not mine you gotta solve that within the first week of praying and fasting we get a phone call and someone says is it going to sound crazy I was doing my morning DeVos and the Lord told me I was supposed to write you guys a check four and then he quotes the exact amount and how many of you know a lot of people want to give you these rounded figures he says some some and 31 cents and you're like that's the exact payoff amount of our student loan and so I was like Lord if you if you want to give me a burning bush you can but I hear you so right then and there we we resigned our church we gave them a six-month transition and we stepped in a full-time campus ministry and every step of the way the Lord's like you're right where you need to be the Lord spoke to us directly prophetically right so sometimes he's going to do it that way he's not always going to do it that way but sometimes he will God wants to guide you he wants to bless you he wants to lead you he's not pushing you off he wants you to lean in God's desire is that we would be diligent about rejecting the dangerous voices and be committed to following the voice of the Holy Spirit because he wants to lead you into places you can never go on your own and he wants to give you a wisdom beyond your own understanding for your family for your work your relationships as you follow his voice I'll leave you with Galatians 5 16. so I say let the holy spirit guide your lives would you bow your head and close your eyes with me all across the
Rs0F9cX3QLg,well today we are continuing our throwback series and so hopefully every week in worship where you're hearing a song that you kind of remember maybe from back in the day when you worship every single week we're doing some throwbacks from different genres and whatnot every sunday matter of fact in a couple weeks uh we'll have our first ever choir up on the stage so you don't want to miss that as well and through this series we're just looking through the old testament looking at old testament heroes and their stories and what god did in and through their lives and how that story and what god did can help us build and grow in our faith in our relationship with god and so today we're going to look at david the story of david and goliath and i've titled my message how to overcome your giant problem how to overcome your giant problem and so let's dive into the story first samuel chapter 17 verse 4 it says then goliath a philistine champion from gath came out of the philistine ranks to face the forces of israel he was over nine feet tall goliath stood at nine and a half feet tall and his armor weighed 125 problems he was a giant and he was a giant problem first samuel 17 verse 8 through 11 it said goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of israel why do you come out and line up for battle am i not a philistine and are you not servants of saul choose a man and have him come down to me if he is able to fight and kill me we will be your subjects but if i overcome him and kill him you will become our subjects and serve us then the philistines said this day i defy the armies of israel give me a man and let us fight each other is your giant overcoming you or are you overcoming your giant on hearing the philistines words saul and all the israelites were dismayed and terrified the new living translation says they were terrified and deeply shaken whenever we're facing a giant problem it is easy to feel terrified or deeply shaken is there a giant in your life that has you terrified or deeply shaken is there a giant problem that's keeping your dreams from becoming a reality is there a giant problem that's robbing you of your peace and joy is there a giant problem that's keeping you and your family trapped i think most of us have some type of giant in our life that we need to overcome matter of fact right now i want you to name the giant you have to overcome maybe for some as you look at the economy and gas prices and inflation your retirement account you're you're facing the fear of the future maybe for some it's a giant problem at work or in your finances or a giant problem in your marriage or dating relationship maybe it's a giant problem with a child or friendship maybe it's a giant burden you're carrying maybe it's a giant sin problem that you're struggling with maybe it's a giant decision you're wrestling with and you don't know what to do today i want to give you five strategies to overcome your giant problem five strategies to overcome your giant problem the first strategy is this face your giant face your giant you will never overcome your giant until you face your giant the israelite army was not overcoming their giant they wouldn't face him they were putting it off they were procrastinating look at first samuel chapter 17 verse 16 it says for 40 days every morning and evening the philistine champions strutted in front of the israelite army for 40 days and 40 nights the israelite army never faced a giant they had 80 opportunities to face the giant and they kept putting it off they kept delaying see procrastination is the habit of putting off until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday why do we procrastinate why don't we face the giant that is holding back our life and so i want us i want us to learn from the israelite army today one of the things they did was they procrastinated look at first samuel chapter 17 verse 23 and 24 it says as he was talking with them goliath the philistine champion from gath came out from the philistine ranks then david heard him shout his usual taunt to the army of israel and as soon as the israelite army saw him they began to run away in fright the israelite army didn't just procrastinate they also ran away from their giant some of you aren't facing your giant because you're constantly running away from it you're scared you're fearful and you keep running away from your giant problems some of you keep making excuses of why you can't face your giant it's too big there's no way i can win some of you are pretending like you don't have a giant problem you're in denial everybody else sees your giant you're like what giant i ain't got no problem please this this is not affecting me i'm not it's not holding back my life and to overcome your giant problem you can't keep pretending like you don't have a problem you can't keep procrastinating or running away or making excuses you have to make up your mind and face your giant just like david did look at first samuel chapter 17 verse 32 don't worry about this philistine david told saul i'll go fight him david said i'm going to face the giant problem that's making our life miserable today determine that you are going to face your giant problem that is in your way ask god to give you the courage to face your giant today to have the difficult conversation to put some distance between you and the person that's hurting you to put some boundaries in place for your family to forgive to stop blaming people for where you are in life and to do something about it to get out of the abusive situation to start spending time with your kids stop screaming at your spouse and work through the issue stop hanging out with those friends that are pulling you away from god you gotta face your giant the second strategy to overcoming a your giant problem is you have to lead your emotions don't let them lead you lead your emotions don't let them lead you david encountered all kinds of emotions but he led his emotions well and that was key to him overcoming the giant let's look at some emotions that that david dealt with first is the emotions of fear first samuel 17 verse 23 and 24 it says as he was talking with them goliath the philistine champion from gath stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance and david heard it when the israelites saw the man they all ran from him in great fear they all ran including david like all of us david dealt with the emotion of fear second is the emotions of discouragement look at first samuel 17 verse 28 it says when eliab david's oldest brother heard him speaking with the men he burned with anger at him and asked why have you come down here and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert i know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is you came down only to watch the battle david's oldest brother condescending questioning david's heart and motives david had to deal with discouragement thirdly the emotions of feeling overwhelmed first samuel 17 38 and 39 it says then saul dressed david in his own tunic and put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head david fastened on his sword around the tunic and tried to walk around because he was not used to them i cannot go in these he said to saul because i am not used to them and so he took them off king saul told david he needed to wear his armor to fight the giant i can only imagine the emotions and the mind games as david is putting on all this armor and he's like this doesn't fit this doesn't feel right how do i tell the king like he's trying to help me maybe i shouldn't even face this giant like god this is too complicated it's too difficult imagine just the emotions and the overwhelmed feeling of telling the king like i i can't wear this i i can't go in this armor fourth he dealt with emotions of feeling inadequate and intimidated first samuel 17 41-44 goliath the bible says goliath walked out toward david with his shield bearer ahead of him sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy am i a dog he roared at david that you come at me with a stick and he cursed david by the names of his gods come over here and i'll give your flesh to the birds and wild animals goliath yell this huge giant is threatening him is speaking these intimidating words to david david had so many emotions he had to overcome before he was able to face his giant and if you're gonna face your giant problem and overcome it you have to lead your emotions well the hardest person on this planet to lead is yourself the hardest person to lead is yourself don't allow your emotions to keep you from overcoming your giant don't let your emotions distract you from what needs to be done you have to take control of your emotions instead of allowing them to take control of you you have to learn to lead your emotions well listen you don't have to be controlled by worry and anxiety you don't have to fly off the handle with anger ephesians 4 26 in your anger do not sin do not let the sun go down while you are still angry listen we all get angry you can't change what you feel but you can change what you do you can be angry and not sin you don't have to react in anger and send the hateful text you don't have to speak with that harsh tone you don't have to give them a piece of your mind you don't have to have that attitude you don't have to cuss people out pastor the devil made me do it no he didn't you're out of control anger did you don't have to be controlled by fear second timothy 1 7 it says for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind god has not given you a spirit of fear or a spirit of discouragement or a spirit of overwhelmed or feeling inadequate or intimidated god has given you a spirit of love and of power and a sound mind come on somebody say i have a sound mind oh say it again i have a sound mind you can lead your emotions well so that you can overcome your giant problem number three let me give you the third strategy to overcome your giant problem do the little things like they are big things do the little things like they are big things luke 16 10 it says if you are faithful in little things you will be faithful in large ones but if you are dishonest in little things you won't be honest with greater responsibilities see david was able to face the giant problem and overcome it because he was faithful in the little things being faithful in the little things it prepares you to overcome the big things let me give you some little things to be faithful and number one be faithful with your work first samuel 16 11 it says then samuel asked are these all your sons you have there is still the youngest jesse replied but he's out in the fields watching the sheep and goats send for him at once samuel said we will not sit down to eat until he arrives see long before david faced a giant named goliath he was being faithful to work hard right where he was see the best preparation for tomorrow's giant problems is to do your best with today's little problems be faithful with the sheep problems so you'll be prepared for the giant problems listen are you working hard right where you are or are you cutting quarters slacking off barely getting by be faithful with your work number two be faithful with your serve david was prepared to overcome his giant because he was faithful with his serve look at first samuel chapter 16 verse 13 it says so as david stood there among his brothers samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed david with the oil and the spirit of the lord came powerfully upon david from that day on then samuel returned to ramah see after david was anointed to be the next king of israel he went right back to working with his sheep he wasn't too anointed to work with sheep he was a servant and even though he was anointed to be the next king he was willing to sin to serve the current king with excellence first samuel 16 21 it says so david went to saul and began serving him it says saul loved david very much and david became his armor bearer david was faithful to serve in whatever season god had him in if you want to be prepared to overcome giant problems be faithful with your serve serving is your key to your success god honors those that serve matter of fact yesterday we had many of our church family going all throughout indianapolis it was served day for our church and going out and serving and and making a difference we have picks from serve day that we want to show you today just going to various places and serving and listen for some of you something came alive inside of you you saw god use you in ways you've never seen him use you before god filled you with some passion and some excitement i know for some of you god he's even lit a fire inside of your heart now for outreach ministry you were thinking man i could be doing more i could be making a bigger difference god god what do i do what is my next step how can i serve how can i make a greater difference and listen for those of you god lit that that that flame listen and we just want to fan him we want to fan that flame and help you and equip you we would love for you to start an outreach small group would you turn that ministry into a small group and invite others and just to serve our city and so if you're interested in that you know god put that in your heart would you text pc groups to 9400 you'll get a quick lick click the link fill out that quick form and one of our small group team well we'll call you and we'll will help you get that outreach group started so that you can continue and serve and make that difference don't let that fire die out that god put inside of you yesterday come on let's fan that flame serving is the key to your success matter of fact many of you you serve faithfully every sunday on wednesday come on 90 degrees hot and muggy humidity just slaps you in the face just disrespectful and our parking lot team is out there waving and loving and smiling in the rain the snow every week we have greeters ushers people serving in our kids ministry in our youth ministry worship and production graphic media video social media production administration so many people serving because serving is key to your success and if you're not on the dream team would you join would you do the little things well sign up for growth track august 7th and join the dream team he was he was faithful be faithful with your serve thirdly he be faithful with authority be faithful with authority david was ready to overcome his giant because he was a man under authority first samuel chapter 17 17. it's this one day jesse his dad said to david take this basket of roasted grain and these 10 loaves of bread and carry them quickly to your brothers in verse 20 it says so david left the sheep with another shepherd and set out early the next morning with the gifts as jesse had directed him he arrived at camp just as the israelite army was leaving for the battlefield with shouts and battle cries david was faithful to obey his dad in the small thing and his obedience to his dad put him in position to overcome the giant see small obedience leads to big victories oh yeah go ahead tweet that tiki take it whatever you do let me rewind remember small small obedience leads to big victories david even had an opportunity to kill saul if you know the story saul tried to kill him on multiple occasions and one night david rolled up on saul snoring drool coming out of his mouth it was his moment to kill saul but this is what david said in first samuel chapter 26 verse 9 through 11 david said i will not touch the lord's anointed the lord will strike him or his time will come and he will die david understood what many people today don't understand in our society being faithful to honor authority is key to overcoming the giant problems we face in life and the bible says so much about this if you want to jot these scriptures down you can study it on your own romans 13 1-2 hebrews 13 17 first peter 2 13-14 first peter 5 5 titus 3 1 ephesians chapter 6 verse 1 and 3. and listen you don't even have to agree with authority to show honor you can disagree and still show honor fourth thing to be faithful be faithful with what you have david was prepared to overcome the giant because he was being faithful with what he had see so many people aren't prepared to overcome their giant because they're not being faithful with what they already have look at first samuel chapter 16 verse 18 it says one of the servants said to saul one of jesse's sons from bethlehem is a talented heart player not only that he's a brave warrior a man of war and has good judgment he is also a fine looking young man and the lord is with him see david was faithful to develop his skills come on he practiced that heart he was practicing that he was working he was developing he he probably developed his fighting skills listen are you developing your gifts and talents he was faithful in developing his wisdom he was known for his good judgment are you growing in wisdom by studying god's word getting in a small group learning from mentors he was faithful in making himself presentable he was a fine looking young man are you presenting yourself in a respectable way come on you aren't ready to overcome your giant because you won't even brush your teeth or floss but are you taking care of your hygiene your hair taking showers wearing clean clothes dressing for success keeping your car clean conviction to clean mine after church he was also faithful in his relationship with god it says the lord was with him david was known as a man after god's own heart david was a worshiper before he became king and he was a worshiper after he became the king listen are you a woman or man of god are you a worshiper are you pursuing god with all your heart be faithful right where you are and with what you have let me give you the fourth strategy to overcoming your giant problem number four is remember how god has helped you overcome giants in the past when getting ready to face a giant take time to reflect on how god has helped you overcome past giants before david faced the giant he remembered how god had helped him in the past look at first samuel chapter 17 verse 34-36 it said but david said to saul your servant has been keeping his father's sheep when a lion or bear came and carried off the sheep from the flock i went after it struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth when it turned on me i seized it by his hair struck it and killed it your servant has killed both lion and bear this uncircumcised philistine will be like one of them because he has defiled the armies of the living god y'all david was a bad boy he was killing lions and the lions tigers and bears were saying oh my when they saw dave he's like no you're not taking my sheep and he went after and god helped him defeat the lions and bears let me ask you what lions and bears has god help you overcome in the past come on think about what god has already done for you how he helped you overcome the addiction the divorce the broken heart the abuse the poverty the sickness depression anxiety oh don't you forget god gave you that job that money that house that car that family those friends god has brought you as he brought anybody in here a mighty long way don't you dare forget it he helped you overcome some lions and bears and he'll help you overcome the giant that stands in front of you remember how god has helped you and then number five realize that the blessings that come from overcoming giants realize the blessings that come from overcoming giants first samuel 17 26 it said david asked the soldier standing nearby what will a man get for killing this philistine and ending his defiance of israel who is this pagan philistine anyway that he's allowed to defy the armies of the living god david asked what blessing is on the other side of this giant you need to ask yourself that question today what blessing is on the other side of the giant problem you're facing listen to what the previous verse says as the army was talking amongst themselves first samuel 17 25 it says now the israelites have been saying do you see how this man keeps coming out he comes out to defy israel the king will give great wealth to the man who kills him he will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in israel see there's always a blessing on the other side of your giant problem you have to face your giant to get your blessing face your giant problem because on the other side of that giant problem is peace is joy is progress is victory on the other side of that giant problem is a new season financial breakthrough your business going to the next level starting your new business in ministry on the other side of your giant problem there's a restored relationship a better marriage finding your spouse there's promotion there's healing there is a blessing on the other side and i know that giant seems giant to you but you need to know to god your giant problem isn't giant to him at all that god's going to help you through and help you overcome so that you can get on the other side but you'll never get on the other side until you face your giant you got to lead your emotions well you got to keep doing the little things like they're the big things you got to keep remembering the same god that helped you defeat the lion and the bear will be the same god that will help you overcome this giant and there's blessing on the other side we all face giants but thank god we serve a god that is way bigger than our giant problem

ridiculous everybody say ridiculous i just like that word uh someone uh the title of my message is ridiculous trust you know trust is an interesting thing there are some people that are maybe too trusting and then there are others they don't trust anybody or maybe some of you are like this gentleman come on anybody like that anybody would you're like man that's about the list of people that i can trust or or maybe you're like this one two reasons i don't trust people i don't know them and i know them there you go so i thought that was funny and this this next one made me laugh never trust someone who takes hours to text you back but when you're with them they always got their phone in their hand texting like why don't you turn in my text and and then the last one here this little guy's funny i don't trust you but it's anything too hard for the lord and trust issues i want to talk about trust issues most people have trust issues most people have had trust issues and i want you to think back what are moments in your life that have caused you to have trust issues what are moments in your life where maybe right now you have trust issues or you had trust issues as i started thinking back to my life there are a lot of things i've encountered that have caused me to have trust issues there were a few that came to mind when i was betrayed by a friend and that caused me to have some trust issues when i found out a role model somebody i looked up to was living a lie that really did damage to my trust who ma who can i trust when someone that someone that's close to me and i love found out that they were being sexually abused caused some major trust issues you know a few weeks ago we did a series on church hurt i've experienced some church hurt i've experienced some things in church that caused me to have some tremen can i even trust christians can i even trust the church what was your moment maybe it was your childhood maybe a bad relationship with your parents maybe abandonment neglect abuse betrayal violence rape what what was the moment or moments that have caused you and maybe today you still have trust issues maybe it was an assault maybe you were bullied maybe it was an accident maybe it was illness maybe an affair divorce death of a loved one maybe there was a theft or damage of your personal property maybe you were taken advantage of maybe there's some deep disappointment the reality is i think all of us can admit to having trust issues maybe we don't have them anymore but at some point things have happened that caused us to have or have had trust issues and so let me ask you how your how is how are your trust issues impacting your relationships today are your trust issues causing you to lash out are your trust issues causing you to have bitterness a root of bitterness in your life are they have they caused you that you can't trust anybody you keep everybody at a distance you don't have any close friends maybe it's caused you to isolate what what have your trust issues done to you maybe maybe you have secret sin or you have secret uh you you have hidden things in your life maybe there's secret pain and you keep it to yourself because you don't believe you can trust anybody to know the challenge the struggle the pain and what many christians fail to realize is that trust issues leak over into our relationship with god see so many christians find themselves believing in god but not trusting god and in order to have a ridiculous faith in god we have to have ridiculous trust in god you'll never have faith that pleases god until you have a ridiculous trust in god look what hebrews 11 6 says it says and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him see faith that pleases god first believes that god exists and secondly it trusts that if we seek and obey god he will reward us let me ask you do you believe god will reward you if you seek him and obey him the answer to that question is not going to be found in your words the answer is found in your lifestyle are you earnestly seeking god are you obeying god's word the big future that god has in store for your life is dependent upon how much you trust god which is evident in how much you seek and obey god i want you to look at some scriptures with me and show you what what benefits come with being that are dependent on your trust in god number one your peace of mind is dependent upon your trust in god look at isaiah 26 3-4 it says you will keep in perfect peace those whose mind is steadfast because they trust in you trust in the lord forever for the lord the lord himself is the rock eternal your safety is dependent upon your trust in god proverbs 29 25 it says fear of man will prove to be a snare but whoever trusts in the lord is kept safe your strength in god is dependent upon your trust in god psalm 28 7 this is the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusts in him and he helps me overcoming your fears is dependent upon your trust in god psalm 56 verse 3 through 4 it says when i'm afraid i put my trust in you in god whose word i praise in god i trust i shall not be afraid what can flesh do to me your blessings are dependent on your trust in god jeremiah 17 verse 7 verse 3 it says blessed is the man whose trust in the lord whose trust is the lord your prosperity is dependent on your trust in god proverbs 28 25 it says the greedy stir up conflict but those who trust in the lord will prosper your dreams coming to pass is dependent on your trust in god psalm verse 37 verse 4 through 5 it says delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart commit your way to the lord trust in him and he will act the big future god has in store for you is dependent on how much you trust god with your family your friends your education your career your money your health your relationships and your future and so i want to help you overcome your trust issues today and we're going to look at one of the most famous verses in the bible to help you overcome your trust issues it's proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 through 6. i'm sure many of you familiar it says trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths we're going to break down this verse today and i believe god is going to use this verse to help us overcome our trust issues so that we can have ridiculous trust ridiculous faith and we're gonna see god do big things we're gonna see big breakthrough in our lives so number one trust god with all your heart the word trust in the hebrew means to set one's hope and confidence upon or to cling to when my children were little whenever we would visit somebody that had a dog it didn't matter if it was a chihuahua or a saint bernard but whenever we visited somebody with the dog you have never seen a two-year-old scale appearing so fast in your entire life all right and it was a death grip i mean they saw that dog and they they were i didn't they they clinged to me so tight i didn't have to hold them they were not letting go i could have my hands free and they were not falling off of me they were clinging to us they trusted that dad would protect them from the that's what that's what clinging this is what god says he says this trusting me with all your heart it means you cling to god with all your might and you aren't letting go for any reason trust in god means we cling to god look what psalm 63 8 says it says i cling to you your strong right hand holds me securely let me ask you are you clinging to god with all of your heart or with just some of your heart are you clinging to god with all of your heart or just some of your heart do you find yourself clinging to god when it comes to your salvation but not your dating are you clinging to god with your job but not with your money are you clinging to god with personal problems but not with your future listen what are you clinging to a ridiculous trust says i'm clinging oh come on come and get me devil i'm i'm holding on to god with all i have with all hey listen i'll start wrapping my legs around stuff around listen to the devil ain't nobody getting me to leave my i'm clinging i'm trusting the god i don't trust anybody i'm clinging so i'm clinging to them for my family i'm cleaning for my faith my kids in the holiday season i'm clinging on to god i'm clinging on to god i'm clean the good days i'm clinging in the bad days i'm clinging when i'm sick i'm clinging when i'm healthy i'm clinging when finances are good i'm clinging when they're bad i'm clear i'm hey come on try to get me off this pulpit i guarantee you can't you have to take me and my god cause i'm not going anywhere this is what it means i know you won't take a picture that's okay this is what it means to cling i'm clinging onto god with everything i don't even know if i can let go right now see if i can get myself out of this all right praise it says i'm clinging to god in my marriage my dating school job business ministry future trusting god with all of your heart is clinging onto him and not letting go number two the second part of that verse it says lean not on your own understanding lean not on your own understanding ridiculous trust means we don't lean on our own understanding when you study the word lean it it's not just talking about you know you know some people are cool they just kind of lean back you know when they walk in let's not talk we're talking about lean here and the hebrew literally means to put all of your weight onto something for it to hold up your weight okay it's like uh a few years ago when my son was playing little league football you go to these games and they don't have a lot of bleachers and so you got the chair you know the chair you like you fold it up and got the little bag on it and so i had my chair and unfolded it out and boom sat on it and it didn't hold up my weight i was like oh snap help somebody can somebody help me it just gave and i fell right i trusted that chair and that chair had failed me to hold up all of my weight see a lot of people are leading their lives on their own understanding and because of that they're constantly following falling over a lot of people are leaning on their own understanding they find themselves sitting in a broken chair like this help me help because they're leaning on their own understanding instead of leaning instead of clinging to god see leaning on our own understanding will never hold us up in life when we lean on our own understanding you know what we do we worry instead of pray when the bible says we need to pray about anything don't worry about anything pray about everything when we lean on our own understanding we fight to be first instead of being willing to be last and the bible says the first shall be last the last shall be first when we lean on our own understanding we do all we can to climb up instead of going down we're full of pride instead of full of humility and the bible says you got to humble yourself under god's mighty hand and then you will be lifted up god will lift you up when we lean on our own understanding we talk first instead of listening first but the bible says we need to be slow to speak quick to listen we hold grudges instead of forgiving the bible says we need to forgive because christ forgave us we hate others instead of loving others the bible says you got to love your enemies and do good to those who persecute you when we lean on to our own understanding we hold on to our money instead of giving it away the bible says it's more blessed to give than to receive this week when i was studying proverbs 3 this jumped out to me in a new way just just again thinking about this concept of trusting god with my own heart and not leaning on my own understanding proverbs chapter 3 verse 9 and 10. look what god says he says honor the lord with your wealth and with the first fruits of all you produce this first simply comes down to whether we will trust god or not this verse is about trusting god with all of our heart this verse is about not leaning on our own understanding i know when you start to think about it people when they think about tithing and giving hold up god's going to bless me he's going to open up the windows of heaven there's just things that are like man it just doesn't make sense and we can start to lean on our own understanding instead of just fully trusting god in his whole word with with our whole heart but his word says listen when you will trust me when you give me the first not the last not the mid fruits not the leftover fruits not the after you take care of yourself fruits but if you will trust me and give me the first fruits it says then your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will be bursting with wine but you will never experience the plenty and the bursting until you trust god with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding it's all about returning it's all about trusting god with all your heart and again when it comes to this listen a lot of people lean on their own understandings it doesn't make sense to be a giver they don't believe god's a rewarder of those who earnestly seek him and what happens is trust issues they are keeping you from the big future that god has for your life how do we overcome our trust issues lean not on your own understanding number three that verse it says in all your ways acknowledge god in all your ways see ridiculous trust acknowledges god in all our ways everybody say all it re ridiculous trust it says god i acknowledge you on my good days and my bad days i acknowledge you when things are going my way and when they're not going my way i acknowledge you when i get the raise and promotion and when i don't get the raise and promotion i acknowledge you in all my ways i acknowledge you when relationships are going great and when they're stressful i acknowledge you when i got a lot of money in the bank and when i have a little money in the bank i acknowledge you when i'm healthy and i acknowledge you when i'm sick acknowledging god in all your ways means every day in all things i acknowledge you no matter what's happening in my life your god you're in control you are sovereign i'm putting my trust in the king of kings and the lord of lords i acknowledge you in all of my ways even when i don't see it i acknowledge you even when it doesn't make sense i acknowledge you in all my ways i trust you and you alone and then number four is this let god direct your paths let god direct your paths ridiculous trust means we let god direct our path some versions of the bible say make your paths straight i want to share with you three important things i want you to understand about following god's path number one is this if you have ridiculous trust god will show you which path to take listen in life there's going to be all sorts of paths we got to take god's path part of trusting god is saying even though i see all of these different paths god i am taking your path for us to experience the big future god has for you have to take god's path some of you you haven't been trusting god with all your heart and you're on the wrong path there's nothing worse to be working extremely hard and be on the wrong path going the wrong way all your hard work for nothing today some of you you need to start trusting god and get on the right path get on the right relationship path the right dating path the right friendship path the right financial path the right career path the right educational path part of trusting god is getting on his path number two is this when you have ridiculous trust in god he will make your path straight when you start trusting in god god takes crooked paths and he makes them straight when you start trusting god there may have been obstacles on your path but when you start trusting god god starts to remove the obstacles that are blocking your success listen some of you you're on the right path but you've stopped trusting god and now barriers are blocking your progress and you're stuck you're not seeing progress with your dreams because you don't have ridiculous trust in god you're leaning on your own understanding and you you're like this you're in the chair like this trying to figure out why you can't get on the right path why you can't go the right way number three is this some of you are on the right path and god has made the path straight but you're not taking any steps you're you're not walking on the path that god has shown you you see it you're looking at it but you keep looking and you're looking instead of stepping you're looking instead of walking listen you need to start walking by faith trust god and walk trust god and move forward look what the bible says in second corinthians 5 7 it says for we walk by faith walk by faith we don't get stuck by faith we don't sit by faith we don't just talk by faith it says we walk by faith not by sight come on let me tell you gotta start walking i'm believing some of you today you are gonna start trusting god and you're gonna start walking say god i don't see it it doesn't all make sense but i am done leaning on my own understanding i'm acknowledging you in all your ways and i'm walking on the path some of you you need to start taking some steps you need to start walking in faith in your relationships come on you need to take that step and get married or you need to take that step and you need to ask somebody out or maybe god's showing you his path is you need to end that relationship you got to stop looking and thinking and you got to start walking some of you got to take steps to forgiveness there's bitterness and hatred and god wants to set you free he's got a big future but until you start walking if you don't start walking it's not gonna happen you gotta walk in faith some of you today you gotta start walking in faith and start the business you got to start walking in faith and start serving on the dream team you got to start walking taking steps and praying every day you got to take steps and start tithing you got to take steps and you got to start serving on the dream team listen we serve a god that says listen i've given you the paths but we got to walk on them we got to walk on them we have to take the steps of faith and as a church we are taking steps of faith we're walking by faith if you haven't been here recently we're looking to buy land looking to buy a building we're knocking on doors we're having conversations we believe that's god's path for us and we're taking steps of faith that in 2022 we're gonna buy land or buy a building we currently lease this one we want to own our own in a prime location and so we're walking we're taking steps of faith in 2022 we want to continue all of our mission support we want to continue to plant churches we want to continue to support all of our missionaries we want to continue to support our strategic partners here in indianapolis hope center indian and other places and salvation army we want to continue to support orphans and so we're walking [Music] by faith we're taking a step of faith so here

faith and become a consistent tither in 2021 2022 would you take steps would you would you walk by faith i'm telling you right now taking that step of obedience is going to open up blessings and breakthrough in your life the second step that we're all asking all of us to take together some of you who have already been doing this but would you pray and ask god what he would have you give the next year the next 12 months to dream builders dream builders is what accelerates the vision at people's church don't don't move your tithe over the dream builders tithe is how we pay the bills that's how we function on a weekly basis dream builders is how we're going to purchase land dream builders is how we do all of our missions work and all we're asking is would you take a step of faith would you ask god god what do you want me to give to dream builders in the next year and whatever god speaks to you would you write it down would you take a step of faith would you write it down on the card

UM4fdRNjxS4,well today we are continuing our series called Angels and Demons when we're talking about the Unseen understanding the Unseen and uh today we're going to continue to talk about angels I I kicked off the series last Sunday if you missed that it was it was an introductory on angels I would encourage you go to our YouTube Page search People's Church Indianapolis if you missed that message watch it on our YouTube page but today we're going to continue to talk talk about angels and in a recent poll over 70% of Americans believe in angels our culture is fascinated with angels in a in a recent or excuse me there have been lots of TV shows and movies about angels and even different types of angels in a movie It's a Wonderful Life Clarence was a guardian angel in the movie Angels in the Outfield they were invisible angels that were helpers in a baseball game in the movie The Preacher's Wife an angel named Dudley shows up to minister to a family in a TV show Touched by an Angel an angel named Monica is promoted to rescue and protect people in the TV show Dominion the Archangel Gabriel is depicted as a warrior with huge wings and a sword there are so many movies and TVs about angels dating or Date with an Angel Supernatural the a good place miracle workers City of Angels and the list goes on and on and I I need you to know that these movies and TV shows don't accurately describe the different kind of angels in the Bible but one thing is true in the Bible there are different types of angels the Bible is full of real life encounters with angels and the Bible describes many different times of them and types of them and as I've studied I I've noticed that different Scholars and theologians have differing opinions on some of the creatures in the Bible some classify them as angels and some don't but there is a whole lot of information in your Bible about angels I mean a whole lot and so if you are a notetaker Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready stretch that hand crack them knuckles whatever you need to do I have a ton of notes for you today and if you're not that fast on our U verion you may not know this but on U verion every Sunday you can look up People's Church Indianapolis and our points all of my points in scriptures are on there okay if you can't keep up with me but here we go four major types of angels in the Bible number one is seraphim the seraphim are described in the Bible as firey Angelic beings these angels are only mentioned in Isaiah 6 Isaiah chap 6: 2-4 it said above him were sarapin each with six wings with two Wings they covered their faces with two they covered their feet and with two they were flying and they were calling to one another holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the whole earth is full of his glory at the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds Shook and the temple was filled with smoke so they have three pairs of wings so a total of six wings two Wings cover their face two Wings cover their feet they have a face like us humans do they also have feet and in verse six it says they have hands and then the other two wings were for flying so some angels do fly these angels also have the ability to speak the primary role of the sah him as described in Isaiah's vision is to worship and praise God continuously they call out holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the whole earth is full of his glory the seraphim were also involved in purifying and cleansing Isaiah in Isaiah chap 6: 5-7 the seraphim took a hot Cal from The Altar and they touched it to Isaiah's lips symbolically cleansing him of his sins and preparing him for his prophetic Ministry secondly there are cherubim the cherubim are talked about in several places in the Bible for example Exodus 25: 20 and 22 Exodus chap 1 10 and 28 2 Kings chapter 19 verse1 15 2 Chronicles chap 5 ver8 Psalm Psalm 80 verse1 and Hebrews 9 verse5 in Ezekiel 1: 5 and 6 it says they have a human form with four faces Ezekiel 1:10 and 10:14 one face was a cherub or an ox the second was the face of a human being the third was the face of a lion and the fourth was a face of an eagle Ezekiel 1:7 says their legs were straight their feet are like those of a calf ezekiel: 15 says cherubim are described as having two sets of wings which is a total of four wings Ezekiel 108 says they have hands underneath their wings Ezekiel 10:12 says their entire bodies including their backs wings and hands are covered with eyes I don't know if I want to meet a chair I'm just being honest with you I'm just ah Lord please let me know it's a cherubim Ezekiel 15 and Ezekiel 1010 through2 cherubim are described as transporting God's Throne on Supernatural Wheels full of eyes now these angels aren't known for protecting people they're known for protecting and guarding the places of God in heaven and on Earth let me give you one example the first time we read about a cherubim they're protecting a place on earth look at Genesis 3: 24 after he drove the man out he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life and so this is referring the the first uh humans were placed in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve and they disobeyed God they were removed from the garden where there was now mortality and then God placed a cherubim at the entrance of the garden to protect and the uh uh to protect and guard the garden along with that sword uh and so these angels guard the places of God in heaven and on Earth and if I was Adam and Eve and I saw that cherubim standing over there I'd like yeah we not doing that again come on come on Eve no we the third the third type of Angel is archangels Archangel can be translated as Chief angel they are a prominent and well-known category of angels in the Bible they played a significant role in the Bible I want to give you six facts about archangels number one is this Michael is the only Archangel listed by name in the Bible you can find this in Jude 1:9 and Daniel 10:13 but many scholars believe that there are more archangels one example one example Daniel 10:13 but for 21 days the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way then Michael one of the archangels came to help me and I left him there with the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia it says one of the archangels which would imply there are more archangels some scholars believe that Gabriel is another AR Angel he is the only other Angel mentioned by name in the Bible and he had some pretty big assignments he told Daniel the meaning of his vision in Daniel 8:16 and Daniel 9:21 and his biggest assignment happened in the New Testament when Gabriel appeared to both Zechariah and Mary Luke 1119 the angel said to him I am Gabriel I stand in the presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news in the previous verses Gabriel tells Zechariah that his wife is going to have a child this child was John the Baptist and then Luke chap 1: 26 it says in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth a town in Galilee and in the following verses Gabriel announces to Mary that she's going to give birth to Jesus Christ the son of God the second fact about archangels is Michael stands guard over Israel you can see this in Daniel 1210 and so archangels can stand guard over a city a nation or a group of people number three Michael directly opposes Satan archangels can dispute and even battle against Satan Jude 1 19 but even the Archangel Michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said the Lord rebuke you something else that's interesting is there are only four words that Michael Speaks in the entire Bible the Lord rebuke you number four Michael battles against evil angels including Satan you can find this in Daniel 10:21 and Revelation 12 7-9 archangels battle against Satan and his demonic forces number five Michael is a military commander you find this in Revelation 12: 7-9 Michael LED his angels into battle and fought against Satan and his angels Michael was the leader of the Army and the number six archangels shout a loud command when Jesus returns for his church first Thessalonians chapter 4: 16 for the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet call of God and the dead in Christ will rise first an archangel or archangels are coming back with Jesus when he returns for his church the Archangel will give a loud shout so archangels they play an important role in scripture and in the Unseen World the fourth type of Angel is Guardian Angels now why do some people call these particular Angels Guardians Angels well Psalm 9111 it says for he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways and so these particular Angels they guard and they protect God's people so they are sometimes called Guardian Angels some call them common angels or ministering Angels Hebrews 1:14 it says are not all angels ministering Spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation and so these angels minister to God's people now last week I answered the question do we have our own Guardian Angel and I want us to quickly review this because it's very important for where we're headed over the next few weeks and so scripture doesn't specifically say that we all have our own guardian angel but there are verses that make you wonder if that could be the case Matthew 18:10 it says see that you do not despise one of these little ones for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven in Daniel 6:22 my God sent his Angel and he shut the mouths of the Lions they have not hurt me because I was found innocent in his sight nor have I ever done any wrong before you your majesty acts 12:15 you're out of your mind they told her when she kept insisting that it was so they said it must be his Angel an angel supernaturally got Peter out of jail and he went to the house of the Mary Mary the mother of John and the people in the house said his angel must have gotten him out of that jail cell and so we're going to talk more about guardian angels and also over the next several weeks but I I first want to show you um some other things that are pretty interesting about angels angels have different rankings and power there's clearly a hierarchy of leadership amongst the Angels we've already learned that there there are archangels and the archangels have authority over other Angels according to Revelation 12:7 it says then war broke out in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back it said Michael and his angels Michael was the leader over a group of Angels in in Daniel 12:1 Michael is called the Great Prince and so he's given a name that would Elevate him above other Angels Peter speaks of Jesus going to heaven and lists a hierarchy of Angels 1 Peter 3:22 it says who has gone into heaven and it is is at God's right hand that's speaking of Jesus it says with angels authorities and powers in submission to him Paul Peter says there are angels authorities and Powers some Scholars rank the authority of Angels in this order archangels being the most powerful the chief princes you find them in Daniel 10:13 then ruling Angels find them in Ephesians 3:10 Guardian Angels seraphim cherubim elect angels in 1 Timothy 5:21 and living creatures in Revelation 4 6-8 the Bible also talks about a Divine counsel sometimes called the sons of God or the Heavenly Court this is a special group of angels that meet with God and make decisions with God just like on Earth God delegates his authority to us humans and we get to make decisions he does the same in the Unseen World with angels job 1:6 it says one day the members of the Heavenly Court came to present themselves before the Lord and the accuser Satan came with them some translations say Sons of God some say Angels there are certain angels that have been selected to present themselves before God and to help God make decisions it's fascinating job 2:1 it says one day the members of the Heavenly Court came again to present themselves before the Lord and the accuser Satan came with them Psalm 821 God presides over Heaven's Court he pronounces judgment on the heaven ly beings in the ESV Psalm 821 it says God has taken his place in the Divine councel in the midst of the Gods he holds judgment so what I want you to understand is that the spiritual world the spirit world is organized there is a hierarchy of angels something else that's interesting is that angels are messengers who speak to humanity the the word angel in both the old test Testament and New Testament means messenger one of the primary roles of angels is to communicate to God and for God in the Bible we see Angels communicating with God to each other and to humans all throughout the Bible you see Angels speaking to humans they speak by appearing in dreams or visions but we also see them communicating directly to humans they sometimes even appear in physical form and speak to humanity you could be talking to an angel and not even realize it I pointed this out last week look at Hebrews 13:2 do not forget to show Hospitality to strangers for by doing so some people have shown Hospitality to Angels without even without knowing it come on look look look at your neighbor right now look at me right now and tell him did you know you were sitting by an Angel come on come on just tell them just do you know you were sitting by an Angel just just tell them I want to quickly look at God's word and I want you to see some of the reasons why Angels speak to humanity matter of fact I'm going give you nine reasons some of you like oh Lord I thought church was about to end hey I hey I'll get you out on time I proom I always get you out on time so get get get them notes ready nine read number one they can give us a promise from God Genesis 16:10 the angel added I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count the angel had found Hagar all by herself in the wilderness she was ready to die and an angel spoke a message of comfort and promise to her number two they can warn us Genesis 19:15 with the coming of dawn the Angels urged lot saying hurry take your wife and your two daughters who are here or you will be swept away when the city is punished the Angels warned lot to leave Sodom because they were going to destroy the city number three they can give us instructions Genesis 20211 but the angel of the Lord called out to to him from Heaven Abraham Abraham here I am he replied Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac and the angel stopped him and in verses 12 and 13 the angel told him to sacrifice the ram that was in the bush in Judges 13 the angel gives Samson Samson's mother instructions on how to raise him number four they can give us directions acts 8:26 now an angel of the Lord said to Phillip go south to the road the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza the angel gave Phillip Direction I remember Pastor Herbert sharing with me they were praying they knew they were going to plant a church and they didn't know where they were going to plant it and Pastor Herbert thought they were going to plant it in Kansas City he was fired up they were ready to move but he shared that Tiffany wasn't really settled but he was he was convinced we're going to Kansas City and one day they were in a hotel they were preaching in uh uh uh South Oklahoma City they went to an elevator and they were telling this man this man about planting in Kansas City and the man says do not plant in Kansas City do not go they had this whole conversation with this man and after that conversation they prayed about it some more they realized they were not supposed to go to Kansas City they were going supposed to plant People's Church in Oklahoma City and he really believes God sent him an angel to tell him no no no no I don't want you to plant Kansas City I want you to plant in Oklahoma City number five they can encourage us judges 6:12 when the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon he said the Lord is with you mighty warrior the angel encouraged and he called Gideon to his purpose I got saved when I was uh 18 years old and I mean I went from the the you know the partying student drinking get getting drunk uh inappropriate relationships with girls sexual morality all that stuff I was just living wild and crazy and then when I got saved I just quit all of that stuff man my life was just turned around I was in church I was in serving the church doors were open I was there just just had this radical change in my life and when people started to see this change I had so many people they start coming up to me they say you're going to be a pastor you're going to be a pastor and I said you better stop that I don't want to be a pastor stop it I mean I I would get upset with people stop telling me no I don't want to be a pastor made it crystal clear and about six months after getting saved um I I I decided I I realized I needed to get baptized in water come on like the people today they got baptized today can we give it up today come on four people got baptized three in this service so proud of you and so 18 years old 6 months saved I get baptized in water before I went in that water okay if somebody would walk to me and they would say hey you're going to be a pastor I would have said do you want me to punch you in the face I'm trying to get baptized here why you you you know had no zero desire to be a pastor I get baptized I go in the water and I come up when I come out of that water it's one of the few times in my life just the overwhelming just the the the voice of of of God saying I want you to be a pastor calling you the F matter of fact I thought he missed the I like Lord that was for the next person getting baptized or the one before me who do you want me to give that message to okay I'm out of the water I'm telling off there is not a person in the world that knows the battle in my mind right now the wrestle I'm having with God I don't want to be a pastor and an individual comes up to me never met them before in my life and they said hey I just want you to know the Lord I know you don't know me the Lord wanted me to tell you that he's calling you to full-time Ministry and he's going to use you to impact many people Christ now I'm shook never saw that individual ever again maybe it was an angel God saying I know you're wrestling with this this is not even what you want but this is my purpose this is my promise for your life they can they can encourage Us number six they can announce God's plan judges 133 the angel of the Lord appeared to her and said you are Barren and childless but you are going to become

Stood Beside Me and said do not be afraid Paul you must stand trial before Caesar and God has graciously giv you the lives of all all who sell with you so keep your courage men for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me and an angel encouraged Paul that they would not die on a ship that was in the midst of the storm and somewhere around 70 times in scripture God sent angels to encourage his people with the message don't be afraid or fear not God does not want us to live a life controlled by fear and then number nine they can help us experience salvation in Acts 8: 26- 40 the angel gave Phillip direction to go talk to the Ethiopian unic Philip obeyed the Angel and the unic gave his life to Jesus in Acts 10 we see Angels involved in Cornelius and his family coming to know the Lord this this is actually when the door open for Gentiles to receive salvation and after this angelic encounter in Acts 10 the gospel began to spread throughout the Gentile World God so wants people to know Jesus Christ as their lord and savior that he will send an angel how awesome is that
WNaX8a2I3bQ,well thank you thank you good to be with you People's Church uh I I love the fact that I get to do this I mean this is our church this is where me and Danny come to church and uh we love it here and we're really really glad to be a part of all that God's doing here at People's Church we think what God is doing here is amazing right I just want you to know as part of being a missionary I get to travel and speak at lots of churches and I'm just telling you the stuff that's happening here is not happening everywhere this is a blessing right and so we just thank God for his uh the way he's pouring out his Blessing on this church and this community amen amen I want to get right into our message today uh I want to start with a story so before doing Chi Alpha five years ago um I I was a church pastor for 15 years and about eight of those years I was a youth pastor specifically and there was a time where I really wanted our youth ministry to to do a lot for Missions I wanted us to raise a lot of money and like help missionaries do what they need to do overseas but how many of you know that we don't reproduce what we know we reproduce who we are right and so if I wanted our students to do something bold for Jesus I had to be someone who was bold for Jesus and so I decided I'm going to do something I have never done before and I didn't think it through and that's not uncommon for me but I go ahead and in a youth service I'm like I'm going to raise money for Missions by running in the Indie meeting marathon and everyone's like what because I had never run before I'll be honestly I never run before ever like I've been in the gym multiple times I still go to the gym regularly as a discipline but when I do I lift weights I use the non-impact knee machines you know like the elliptical the bike I don't run okay you get to the place where you're in your 40s and you're like there's just certain things I'm not going to do anymore and running's one of them I may never run again okay and uh but I said hey I'm gonna run and uh a lot of students are like we don't really believe this will happen so yeah we'll we'll support that yeah we'll give you money if you go for it and I ended up getting enough people to pledge me over two thousand dollars in commitments for me to finish this race how many of you know once that happens you're like well now I have to run like there's no backing out and so um I showed up and here's what I learned when I showed up like people that run they are a culture how many of you are there any runners in the room if you're a runner raise your hand okay listen you all have a culture that I didn't know about until I showed up like I showed up and I was like oh compression shorts is a thing oh people putting Vaseline on their thighs that's a thing and I was just like I don't know if I'm gonna do all that I don't even know what that's about you get to the end of the race and you're like I probably should have done all of that because let me just tell you folks chafing is a real thing it's a real thing it will mess up your life okay and um but at during points in the race I'm running and I I wanted to quit because uh I don't know how it is now because again I'll never do it again but the one time I did it I was running into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and that's about mile six and when you're coming in um on the Jumbotron there is a guy from Kenya who's crossing the finish line and you think to yourself I'm not even halfway through and someone's done like this is not good right and right then and there like everything just started to deflate out of me I'm like I can't do this I'm not gonna be able to finish right all this stuff and then I notice as I'm on the track running there is um a soldier who's running in combat boots full fatigues and has a fully packed backpack and then a sign on it and he says running for my Fallen Brothers now how many of you know you see that you see the weight he's carrying and you're like if you don't finish this race you are a wuss right so you're just like I have to do this right and then another point in the time in the time of the race I was just like man I'm so that whole second win thing I don't know maybe it's a real thing I never experienced that I just felt like after after literally about mile one I was tired because the guy I was running with I didn't know this he was he was on our church Board of time he was there to support me in this race we're in the first Mile and I'm like I feel like we're going kind of fast and he was like yeah we're gonna Pace this to nine minute miles the whole time here's what you have to understand I had never run more than four miles before this race ever and so I was just like I can't run nine minute miles so can we just slow it down he's like no I'll see you later and took off it's just like now I'm alone right and so trying to run a strong Pace like I was just tired I was exhausted I did not hit the second wind and then the like the motivation from seeing that Soldier I'm gonna be honest a couple miles more like that wears off okay just wears off and then I see another person and it's a father and he's carrying his daughter in his arms and he's like I'm running for muscular dystrophy and you're like I have to finish this race it was pressure right it was peer pressure and because of the pressure I kept running in our lives we tend to be Runners we are people that run and and scripture knows this about us I just want you to see what Matthew 6 verses 31-32 says about this he says so do not worry saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or what shall we fear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them our world does a lot of running after all kinds of things and if we're honest a lot of us in this room are running right now and running all the time we're we're a running-minded society as a matter of fact American culture rewards us for running and running all the time without little rest right like you're going to get the promotion Ron you know you want the money run like we are running minded Society it's something that we're born into I mean think about this the second you are born you start your life of running right you're born and you're like okay now I gotta sleep through the night okay now I gotta say my first word uh now what am I gonna walk when am I gonna run when am I gonna start using the bathroom on my own when am I going to start school when am I going to graduate school when am I going to go to college what am I going to get a job when am I going to start dating what am I going to get engaged when am I going to get get married when am I going to have my first kid what am I gonna have my second kid man what am I gonna stop having kids when am I going to buy my first house when am I going to start that business what am I going to hire my employee what am I going to fire that bad employee when am I going to have my first grandkid my way when am I going to have my second grandkid when are my kids gonna stop giving me grandkids I can't afford this when am I going to retire we are just running from one thing to the next our entire life life has us running all the time always to the next decision the next car payment the next house to buy the next work project the next class to sign up for the next promotion to get the next raise to achieve we just keep running and we're running to work meetings lunch meetings coffee meetings practices games tournaments for spring summer fall and winter sports we're running to appointments we're running to social Gatherings family gatherings and even Gatherings we were we wish we weren't gathering at right the truth is we are constantly running after anything and everything and why do we run after all these things for some of us I think it's because we want acceptance I think for others it might be approval status or you're just hoping to be known so many people run hard and they're running at all costs running after all the things and you're wearing yourself out so the two questions we have to ask is simply this how did we get here and number two why are we willing to pay such a cost with all this running and I think the answer is simple but at the same time it's really difficult and what I mean is simply this I think the reason why we run so hard is because the disorder of our daily life is a byproduct of the disorder in the innermost places of our heart things are not the way they are supposed to be because we are not the way we are supposed to be I mean things are not the way they're supposed to be because we are not the way we are supposed to be internally our hearts and souls things are not the way they're supposed to be so we run and run and run and what's the cost our peace and our joy that's the cost you can run after all the things and wear yourself out you can find yourself depleted and empty on the inside how many of you by a show of hands have ever been on a treadmill before okay I'm glad that's a lot of you that's good this is good news right you've been on a travel you know how it goes right you you turn it on and the motor turns on and the bell starts spinning and hopefully you're on the treadmill when that happens because if not you try and jump on Watts movie that's gonna be a bad day fun day for me to watch but a bad day for you right but you're on the treadmill and you get going and I want you to imagine you go ahead and boost that thing up to like seven eight miles an hour now you're into like a really healthy run and then you go ahead and you increase the incline and we're now at like somewhere between a 10 and a 12 incline and so now you're running uphill this is tiring you can't maintain this for super long and in the midst of that when you're like I'm tired I can't really run at this pace for very long now someone hands you a project at work someone hands you an assignment or a homework assignment that you as a parent you're supposed to be helping but now you're actually doing it for your child or you just found out there's a 13th tournament this month in baseball right and you're just busy and you're just running and what happens is now as a byproduct of this kind of life you can't even sleep at night because you're worried about all the things that have to get done and when you do wake up you're still tired because your sleep wasn't even good from all the worry you don't know how to turn off the treadmill of worry and so you run and run and run you go on vacation and how many of you go on vacation and you run on vacation you don't know how to unplug from work or away from your phone and so you come back for a vacation and you're still running so many people are running and and because of this is costing them their peace and joy now there's a prophet in the Bible his name is Elijah and I'm thankful for Elijah's story because we find in the story of Elijah someone who is running on the treadmill of life and running cost him his peace and his Joy but even more than that it cost him almost his life he got to a point where because of all the running Not only was his peace and joyrah but he literally wanted to end his life at one point things were not the way they were supposed to be because Elijah was not the way he was supposed to be and so to see what the Bible has to say about his life let's go to the book of First Kings chapter 19. I'm going to read verses one through four it says this now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword so Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say May the gods deal with me be it ever so severely if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them how many of you know that's a bad day Elijah was afraid and ran for his life when he came to Beersheba in Judah he left his servant there while he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness he came to a broom Bush sat down under it and prayed that he might die I've had enough Lord he said take my life I am no better than my ancestors Elijah ran and ran and ran and found himself so tired with no peace and no joy and this leaves him asking God to take his life things were not the way they were supposed to be because Elijah was not the way he was supposed to be and there are two things we learn from Elijah's story that will have you running and will rob you of your peace and joy the first one is this your past will keep you running Elijah was running from people he knew because they wanted to kill him just so you understand a little bit of the background of what's happening before Elijah wants to end his life Elijah is a prophet following God and he's in the midst of uh an Empire that is led by Jezebel and Ahab and they they serve this God named Bale and they have these prophets that worship Him and there basically was a standoff it was like let's find out today whose God is the real God is it Baal or is it my God and so the challenge is simply this we're going to build an altar we're going to put a sacrifice on the Altar and then we're going to each pray and whoever's God can rain down fire from heaven and consume the sacrifice that's the real God and so the prophets of Baal it says that they go ahead and they're praying and they're working themselves up and Elijah because this is going on for hours he actually starts to taunt them right I don't know how you picture Elijah but he was someone that had a sense of humor and so he looks at the profits the bill and he goes hey guys I don't know if you're loud enough he may not be able to hear you you just can you louder can you be louder and so then they're like whatever they're doing right it says they're doing all kinds of crazy stuff slashing themselves and everything and then he's like maybe your God can't do what you need him to do because maybe he's using the restroom right like literally read the scripture that's the stuff Elijah saying he's going to the bathroom he's just he's now's not the time and he's and nothing is happening and so finally they stop and they say fine you go and he goes just to show you who the real God is I want to show you how powerful he is so I'm not just going to have him rain down fire from heaven we're going to actually soak this sacrifice in water and so much water that starts to fill up the trench around the Altar and then he prays a simple prayer God Rains Down fire from heaven consumes the sacrifice and all of the water and then if that wasn't enough Elijah's like now be gone with you all and he has all the prophets of Baal killed okay now after that happens Jezebel was like oh heck no right and so now she's like I want you dead now Elijah rightfully so all of us just run okay and that's what he does he runs but as he's running from something in his past and someone in his past he then tells his servant you stay here and he Journeys by himself into the wilderness and he's running from his past one of the things I've learned about life is that if you don't deal with your past it's going to have you running some of you are worn out because you're running from something or someone in your past it might be a past relationship that has you running it might be a past mistake a past failure a past regret a past pain or a past disappointment I remember when I was in high school I grew up on uh the east side of Indy still live there to this day graduate of Warren Central High School yo Dub C all right um so I remember when I was a senior I was in what was called the school to work program and I only had to go to school about three periods of the day and then I got to go to my job and Fridays I didn't have to work they didn't schedule me and so I would leave school I would kind of you know do some stuff at home and I'd come back because I was involved in the marching band I was in the drum line at that time and so we come and we would you know practice and warm up and get in our uniforms and then go perform at the football game for halftime right those are a Friday routine and one day I'm coming back I'm walking into the Performing Arts Center and as I'm walking in there's like something going on I can't remember what it was really was a group of students something was happening and I was just watching what they're doing and I just kept looking I kept watching and then I turned my head I ran into a concrete pillar right in my face I mean I was just like whack and I was first of all the first question is like why do you walk so fast slow down this wouldn't be so painful right and how many of you know like when you get hit in the nose you uncontrollably cry like it's not like a morning crying but it's like my eyes are just watering up right no you can't help it it just happens we're like oh man you dang like that was like I'm not weak I'm not weak I just broke my nose you know so I got smacking this concrete pillar my eyes fill up with tears I can barely see anything I'm backing away I'm like my head is hurting and I hear like like that and blood is just dripping from my nose onto the floor in front of this group of students how embarrassing right and so uh and at Warren like you know you got blood on your shirt everyone's like yo you get in a fight like that's what people are thinking and you're like I wasn't that cool I kind of walked into a concrete pillar you know not awesome at all and I broke my nose right and it was so embarrassed going to school and have like the bruising around my eyes and like everybody like oh my gosh what happened I walked into a pillar stop asking me questions right so embarrassing but I learned a valuable lesson that day and it's a lesson that has served me well and it's simply this focusing on your past will create pain for you in the present come on so you with me this morning focusing on your past is going to create pain for you in the present and I'd like to be vulnerable with you for a moment I realize that because there were things in my past traumas and dramas that I never dealt with that caught up to me and I decided it was time for me to get into therapy and I started going to counseling and I still go to counseling to this day because I was raised in an environment where we didn't deal with nothing right you just you it's brush it off don't cry you're a man don't do that suck it up son like that kind of stuff and so then you go through these experiences they were painful they were hurtful and some of them were really bad things and but you here's how you're programmed to do life stuff it and move on stuff it and move on and as a matter of fact I was rewarded for this stuffing that meant I was more respectable more honorable I thought this was a sign of strength that I I didn't get weak I didn't worry about my pain I I couldn't Express emotion I mean anger and those environments anger is always acceptable because that's a tough one right but it's crying oh no we don't do that come on anyone with me this morning come on you know how you know how it is right and so you get to a place where you're doing this and here's what happened focusing on like not dealing with the stuff in my past had me running but it had me running right past healing and I wasn't whole I was running from peace never towards it I was running from Joy never to it and many of you are like I was you're trying to run from your past and don't realize that because you're focused on your past you're about to get hurt in the present or maybe you're suffering hurt right now in your present and eventually when that does happen you are robbed of peace and joy truthfully here's what I've learned you just can't outrun your past you can't run fast enough or hard enough trying to outrun your past is like running on a treadmill with no stop button it's going to leave you tired depleted and empty on the inside Wayne Dyer says it this way if you don't make peace with your past it will show up in your present Bishop TD Jakes says you can wreck your future by running from your past and the great Theologian Rafiki from The Lion King hey that dude is breaking off some gems y'all if you don't think so you need to re-watch that movie he says the past can hurt but the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it so we learn from Elijah's story that our past Will Keep Us running but another thing we learn from his story is that your fear has you running Elijah was afraid and ran for his life and some of us run after all kinds of things because of fear we run after success accomplishing goals money power popularity and all of it is just driving us to run so hard and behind all of it is just being afraid things are not the way they're supposed to be because we're not the way we're supposed to be we run out of fear the truth is you might be here and you say I'm so afraid of disappointing people so that you try and please everyone and you're running hard you have a fear like fomo is real for you right like it's not a joke it's a real thing you're so afraid of missing out so you say yes to everything and because of that you're way over committed and you're still running for some you might be afraid of the future so you run and your mind is tired and full of anxiety some of you are afraid of being broke so you run yourselves ragged chasing the dollar bill some of you have a fear of not being liked so you run up your credit cards you overspend on cars clothes house vacations just to impress people and get a nice selfie for some of you maybe it's a fear of being lonely so you run from relationship to relationship to relationship but here's what you realize you're still empty and you're still lonely but you still keep running fear will have you running on the treadmill going nowhere and here's what's going to happen the always the end result not only do you feel tired but you are robbed of your peace and your joy every time that's what happens to Elijah that's what happened to me when I was in when I was growing up I quickly learned I grew up in a home that's like you had to be whoever you needed to be for Mom and Dad to be okay that day that makes sense you you real quick as a kid you kind of learned how to navigate this stuff and so then that bled into how I did every relationship I could meet you quickly assess what you expected of me and then work to become that so you would like me that makes sense but here's what happened I hit a point my sophomore junior year of high school where all of the trying to make everyone like me caught up and I couldn't be everything to everyone because sometimes those things didn't come together well as I was trying to dodge and pivot back and forth not really knowing who I was and I'll never forget I went through a season when I was in high school where I started to suffer with just overwhelming fear I would get on the bus and on my way to school I would break out into cold sweats I would feel nervous my stomach would hurt I'd feel light-headed I got to a point where I was like I can't continue this way and so I did the only thing I knew how to do I staged a meeting that nobody knew why we were meeting I had my parents show up to Warren inside the guidance counselor's office and I was like so I brought you all here today because I would like to resign from high school and be homeschooled and my mom was like are you kidding me you pulled me out of work for this but that's right there at that point I knew this was a bad idea I should have talked to someone first right but I just I was trying to take control because I needed something to be different I was tired of being afraid of what people thought of me all the time so many people are gripped and controlled by fear and it has them on the treadmill running that's why the Bible talks so much about fear because it's a big deal in our lives I don't know if you knew this or not but the Bible has verses like talking about do not be afraid or fear not there's literally a 365 verses on not being afraid one for every day of the year so that we don't have to walk in this Zig Ziglar says it this way fear can have one of two meanings in our life it can either mean forget everything and run or face everything and rise today I want to help you face your fears and your past and get off the treadmill that's wearing you down on the inside I want us to get things right on the inside so we can respond correctly to the outside and get your strength joy and peace back how many of you would like that this morning Elijah ran himself to the point of wanting to die but God showed him something to get his life back on track and I want to show you this and I'm going to tell you this right now just as a like a not like a forewarning but when I say these things you're going to be like this is just too simple this is too basic sometimes we think in order for something to be from God it has to be complicated don't we think that sometimes like God's going to come down and speak to us in King James English and it's like that's the only way it's God there's a lot of v's and thou's in there and so I'm going to give you these points they're going to seem so basic but listen why would God give us something complicated if we can't get the basic stuff right right so just get the basics down okay so I just wanted to that was your little warning there okay so the first thing you need to do if you want to get off this treadmill is rest everybody say rest First Kings 19 5 then he laid down come on someone say lay down under the bush and fell asleep all at once an angel touched him and said get up and eat when you're on the treadmill and running after all these things one of the best things you can do is get some rest here's what God told Elijah he's like hey son go take a nap because you're talking crazy okay go get some sleep you'd be better in the morning how many of you have raised kids and you're like you just need to go to bed your attitude is terrible go to bed right we know for them that sleep works but yet we don't exercise this for us right God is saying the same thing to us today he's saying rest take a nap here's some practical advice go to bed earlier put away the phone and get seven to eight hours of sleep really basic stuff medically speaking here are 11 facts about sleeping seven to eight hours a night sleep improves your memory extends your lifespan boosts your creativity strengthens your immune system reduces your risk for depression sleep improves your physical performance sharpens your attention reduces your stress helps your body heal itself helps you lose weight and makes you more alert you all need to go to bed seven eight hours a night listen if I don't sleep seven eight hours a night not only do I feel it but everyone in my household feels it right after church today here's your homework assignment go home take a nap get up eat a really great dinner go back to bed that is a great Sunday right there so get some rest number two God told Elijah to recharge First Kings 19 5 then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep all at once an angel touched him and said get up and he how many of you know food can recharge you if you have never tasted something so delicious that it awakens you to the presence of God you need to go do that this afternoon First Kings 19 8 so he got up he ate and drank strengthened by that food he traveled 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Horeb the Mountain of God Elijah got his batteries recharged by resting and eating a good meal he even went back for seconds which is always good it was so good that he needed a second helping listen God wants to recharge your batteries if there's anything I know about having a family of four we go through a lot of batteries right I mean batteries for the Xbox batteries for the TV remote batteries for the nose hair trimmers like all kinds of stuff okay now y'all can judge me that's okay maybe you don't use nose hair trimmers but you know what's going to happen you're going to come here next Sunday and be like We Are Family like that with your long nose hairs just remember when that happens and someone calls you out I told you so but you need to do what recharges you and that could be different for all of us for some it is to go out and eat a nice meal with some life-giving friends for some it's to go home and sit on the back deck and enjoy the cool weather while sipping a cup of coffee for some it's reading a book or going fishing and Hiking going for a bike ride or going to the park but can I tell you is the best way to recharge your batteries is spending time in God's presence First Kings 19 7 the angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said get up and eat for the journey is too much for you Elijah was visited by an Angel and he was Touched By God's presence recharging in the presence of God will restore your strength your joy and your peace you could be in the worst condition in your soul and one touch from God's presence can completely change your outlook if you want your strength recharged let God's presence touch you when you do here's what will happen number one you will be recharged with strength in his presence Isaiah 40 31. but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength someone say Amen they will soar on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not faint number two you will be recharged with peace in God's presence Romans 15 13 May the god of Hope fill you with all joy and all peace in believing so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in Hope lastly you will be recharged with joy in God's presence Psalm 16 11 you will make known to me the way of life and your presence is fullness of joy and your right hand there are Pleasures forever how many of you know the presence of God literally changes everything it changes everything today somebody is going to get off the treadmill and get your strength peace and joy back but it's going to be because you get into the presence of God and can I tell you like I don't know how you were raised to think about God and His presence the way I was raised in church where everything was a sin right the only version of God I knew was an angry being on a throne ready to strike me down the second I made a mistake that was my version of God until God radically introduced me to who he really is which is a god of Grace he reveals himself as a father and a loving one at that and he has these verses he doesn't say to his kids you need to cowardly approach my Throne of judgment no not Dad he says you need to boldly approach my throne of grace he's the father and the Prodigal Son story who runs to you never from you while we were dead in our sin he loved us listen sometimes the reason why we run from God's presence is because we're afraid and God doesn't want you to be afraid of him that's why he tells us perfect love which by the way is not just a thing it's also a person perfect love who is God because God is love cast out all fear come on are you with me this morning do you know what the second half of that verse says and fear having to do with punishment God is not your Punisher he's the one who blesses you he supplies for you he loves you he has purpose and plans for you and a Destiny for your life that's your father in Heaven amen and he wants to help you get off the treadmill restore to you your strength your peace and joy you just have to run to him

or one of the messages please go to our youtube page you can go on youtube search people's church indianapolis you can watch any one of those sermons but we are going to learn we're learning and we're going to win in 2022 i uh our family we go on a couple family vacations uh every year and uh one of the places we love to go to is the mountains we just love them especially the smoky mountains one they're close you can get there in about four hours or five or six or seven hours and we love going to the mountains and uh my wife doesn't like driving through the mountains but but i don't mind it i love just looking at god's creation and just seeing uh his beauty and just some breathtaking views so i love visiting and vacationing in the mountains what i don't love is driving at night through the mountains because there are no street lights i mean it is pitch black you could be on the edge of driving off a cliff and so when i'm going we're going on vacation i am locked in to my gps i'm watching it you can see how the curves are coming but what i forgot is that some of these mountains are so tall and so high that in some places you don't get reception and in one of our recent trips i'm driving and you ever you know you're trying to follow the map but you ever has it ever been confusing where it's like do i turn now or do is you know have you ever questioned that like that's happened to me a couple times where i what i was saying on the map and what i'm seeing around me wasn't matching up and i wasn't sure and so this happened to us on our last vacation and all of a sudden i get the rerouting dot dot dot oh lord i missed the turn and then no service oh and there ain't nobody out there there's no gas station to pull over jamie's like you need to turn around i'm like what do you mean where am i going to turn around baby you need to turn around right now we got to get back to service y'all we were lost you know what i mean that man is not fun being lost have you ever been lost and then you try to find somebody to help you and they're like yeah go north here and south there i don't know north south east or west no i need to go to the yellow tree and turn left i don't i definitely don't know it at night they're like oh look at this when the sun's out i don't even know what north huh y'all can so y'all we were lost and one of the worst one of the worst areas in our life where we can get lost is in our finances today i want to teach you how to win [Music] in your money when in your money how do you know if you are lost financially listen if you spend more than you make a year you're lost if you don't know if you spend more than you make a year you're lost if you don't care that you might be spending more than you make a year you're lost if you owe more on your car than your car is worth you're lost if you don't know how much you owe on your car you're lost if paying the minimum on your credit card is a the minimum on your credit card is a way of life you're lost if you think paying the minimum on your credit cards is good financial planning you're lost if the only money you're saving is the fica money that's been taken out of your check you're probably lost if you don't know how much debt you owe overall you're lost if you make financial decisions that you hope your spouse never finds out about you're lost if you're doing something financially that you hope the irs never discovers you're lost you can never win financially if you stay lost financially see whenever i'm lost the first thing i have to do is figure out where i am i asked jamie typically she does not know either i then got to go to the map or i'm looking for a gas station i gotta if i don't know where i am i can't move to where i want to be okay the opposite of loss though is being found when it comes to your money it's finding out where you are so that you can move where you need to be and so listen today i want to help you win financially listen don't don't get uncomfortable this this message is not about giving listen i want to help you win financially my goal today is to help you win in your finances so many people are losing financially and i want to help you win so here here's my first point to help you win with your money number one you win when you find out where you are financially the bible says in proverbs 27 23 riches can disappear fast and the king's crown doesn't stay in his family forever so watch your business interests closely and then it says know the state of your flocks and herds the first key to winning financially is to discover where you are some of you you don't know where you are you don't even want to find out where you are it can feel better not to know but if you don't know where you are you will stay lost i want to give you three things i want you to do so you can know the state of your flocks number one get on your computer get get a or get get a pen and paper and figure out how much you are bringing in monthly what is your take-home pay after taxes each month secondly write down what you are spending every month jamie and i we have a document on on evernote and we have everything listed out that we are spending every single month some people use excel sheets some use other programs but you want to write down what you are spending every month and then thirdly write down how much you owe all right any debt any debt that you owe and the interest amounts listen if you're gonna win you have to find out where you are financially number two you win when you live with margin proverbs 27 23 it says riches can disappear fast come on isn't it true that money can disappear fast it's so easy every month to spend more money than you're bringing in your lifestyle can chase your income and you have nothing left over see margin is whatever you earn minus whatever you spend and whatever you have left is your margin and most americans don't have any margin i found some margin money jokes i thought these were kind of funny someone said money talks but all mine ever says is goodbye another one said i remember being in so much debt that i couldn't afford my electricity bills it was a dark time this person said if you think nobody cares whether you're alive try missing a couple car payments i like this one i thought air was free until i bought a bag of potato chips come on so you ever opened up what like this thing is a third full air's expansive the last one i don't want money it's only the people who pay their bills who want that and i never pay mine listen people who live with no margin they make two wrong assumptions first is they assume nothing majorly unexpected will happen i don't foresee any immediate big problems and then something happens unexpectedly and people are in trouble they don't get the raise or bonus they were counting on the boss says we're downsizing the company and they lose their job the boss says everybody in the company is taking a 15 pay cut the car breaks down and it costs a thousand dollars to fix it they bought their first home and the hot water heater stops working no margin it leads to trouble and no peace this the second is they they assume the number one enemy to margin is their income people think if i could ever get the job the education the promotion the sale the huge raise i would have financial margin because all i need is a little bit more money see the number one enemy to margin is not income it's lifestyle all more money does for most people is raise their lifestyle they get more and they upgrade the car the house the television new electronics nicer vacations buy a boat more clothes more going out to eat and there are people who are making a whole lot of money and still have financial pressure and are even close to filing bankruptcy the issue for a lot of people isn't making more money it's spending less money many americans received thousands of dollars of stimulus checks from the government in 2020 and 2021 and many were still working their job first round was one thousand two hundred dollars per adult and five hundred per child second round was six hundred dollars per adult and six hundred per child third round was one thousand four hundred per adult and one thousand 400 per child a married couple with two kids who maintain their jobs received an additional eleven thousand four hundred dollars on top of their salaries and a lot of people didn't pay off debt or create margin by saving this money they spent it more money does it mean more margin more money means an upgraded lifestyle and then christians they get into financial trouble and they pray god i need you to provide more money god this tithing thing doesn't work you aren't blessing me with money and god says yes i did but you spent it you're driving in it living in it you're eating out with it you're wearing it when you don't have margin you rob yourself you rob yourself of financial freedom you can't plan for the future you can't accomplish your financial goals you can't get out of debt you can't save for the future you rob yourself of financial peace because you're always stressed out about money and when you don't have margin you rob god like god wants to use your life in greater and greater ways but when god speaks to you to give you can't respond god says i want you to go on a missions trip i want you to help someone in need i want you to feed the poor i want you to give to dream builders i want you to buy someone's groceries i want you to support an orphan but you can't do what god has laid on your heart because you don't have margin proverbs 21 20 it says the wise have wealth and luxury but fools spend whatever they get and i want you to live a life of wisdom and to have margins so that you can do all god is calling you to do one of the best financial decisions jamie and i made was to live with margin we're not going to compare we're not going to compete with people we want to have margin we obeyed god and we've been able to save because we have margin we've been able to save and we've been able to give generously and give into the things that god is asking us to give simply because of margin let me share with you how jamie and i got margin in our financial life because we did not always have margin there were seasons we were spending more than we were making we were racking up debt we were living with a lot of financial pressure and so the first thing we did is is we saved a thousand dollars in an emergency fund if you don't have an emergency fund of a thousand dollars listen save for one right now emergencies will happen whether it's your car health appliances do whatever you have to do to get a thousand dollars in an emergency front have a garage sale downsize your car stop eating out stop buying coffee cut off netflix hulu cable your phone data plan pastor are you crazy yes you're right i'm crazy i'm a little crazy because normal isn't working normal isn't working and can i tell you jamie we did we bought a vehicle we should have never bought and so we sold it and we got a cheaper vehicle that we didn't like as much but we needed margin and so we downsized and we've cut some things and we've had to make some hard decisions we had to get so get a thousand dollars in an emergency fund and then once we had that thousand dollars we didn't touch that thousand dollars in that emergency thump fund we then we got rid of all credit card school and car debt it took time it took years and right now we are debt-free the only debt we have is our house but then when we got that extra money those payments that we were that we were putting towards at times we were able to put 500 plus dollars towards debt we then instead of taking that and being like let's get a new tv no no we started to save it we started to save it and save it and kept saving it and giving it all right when we dipped into our emergency fund because there were emergencies that happened we always replenished it as soon as possible and then we worked until we got three to six months of savings into our emergency fund work to get three to six months of savings into an emergency fund we were prepared and we are prepared for major emergencies and then fifth we got term life a term life insurance policy just in case the ultimate emergency happens wanna know how jamie becomes a millionaire better treat my wife right but we're covered god forbid it to happen but we're we're covered all right number three how do you win in your money you win when you track your spending you win when you track your spending proverbs 27 23 it's as rich as can disappear fast and the king's crown doesn't stay in the family forever it says so watch your business interests closely you have to have a system to know where your money is going you can't win if you're wondering where your money went you have to remove the mystery and so jamie and i we track our spending we're looking at our debit account and we're tracking it and we make adjustments one time we tracked it and we got hacked and we're like oh lord we didn't spend those seven thousand dollars in her while we went seven it was we didn't have that much at that time but you know 700 maybe we're like no we didn't do that but but we we track our spending and we make adjustments number four you win when you plan your spending when you plan your spending proverbs 23 27 23 it says watch your business interest closely and know the state of your flocks and herds one of the best ways to watch your business interest closely is to plan your spending proverbs 21 5. it says the plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty i want to give you some keys to planning your spending number one is this develop a plan on where you will spend your money develop a plan on where you will spend your money tell your money where to go instead of wondering where it went that's all the budget is a budget is telling your money where to go jamie and i because we had so much debt uh we we decided to use one of dave ramsey's method we do the cash envelopes and so every uh two weeks when we get paid we take cash and we have our budgeted envelopes and we put them all in there so that we are not we were not disciplined with the swipe all right and so we got the cash and the envelopes to to to steer and guide and and it it it where we got a plan that we know exactly which envelopes our money is going to every month number two develop a plan to get out of debt and let me say this too i'm not saying you need to do the cash envelopes find a system that works for you to develop a plan to know uh know where you're on where you're spending your money okay number two develop a plan to get out of debt romans 13 8 it says let no debt remain outstanding except the continuing debt to love one another for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law work towards having no debt remaining outstanding and there is some debt it will keep you from having margin and peace did you realize that if your credit card balance is eight thousand dollars and the average interest rate is twenty percent and you make a minimum monthly payment of a hundred and thirty four dollars at twenty percent interest it will take you 25 years to pay off that debt you will pay 32 282 dollars in interest charges which is almost twice the balance bringing your total to 40 000 dollars 282.84 cents to pay off eight thousand dollars in 12 months you would need to make a 741 dollar monthly payment and you would pay 892 dollars in interest to pay it off in 24 months you would need to make a 407 dollar monthly a payment and your interest would be hundred seventy one 1771. to pay it off in thirty six months you would need to make two hundred and ninety seven dollar monthly payment your interest would be two thousand seven hundred and three dollars to pay it off in 60 months five years you would need to make a two hundred and twelve dollar monthly payment and interest would be four thousand seven hundred and seventeen dollars it is hard to win financially if you're paying a lot of high interest payments every month you got to attack your debt jamie died about 10 years ago we made a decision we got to attack we had 18 plus thousand dollars worth of credit card debt so we had to attack it we used dave ramsey's debt snowball method and it took a number of years but i'm telling you the relief we felt when we finally had all the credit card debt paid off all the car debt paid off i mean a weight was lifted and so if you have debt develop a plan to get out of that debt number three develop a plan to save for purchases as you work to get out of debt you have to also have a plan to stay out of debt or you will rack up a bunch of debt again and so jamie and i we are saving for purchases we knew we needed to replace some carpet in our home and so we saved for it we know in a couple years we're going to need a new vehicle and so we're saving for it jamie's got some remodeling she has a lot of remodeling that she wants to do in the house we're saving for it we save for christmas we have a christmas envelope we put away money for christmas we put away money we save for our vacations you can't win financially if you don't save for future purchases so save for that furniture save for the repair save for the car save for the tv save for christmas save for vacations and then number four develop a plan to save and invest for your future proverbs chapter 6 verse 6 through 8 it says go to the ant you sluggard considers its ways and be wise it has no commander no over sealer or overseer or ruler yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest the ant is wise because it stores for the future you are wise and you will win if you store for the future if you paid off that eight thousand dollar credit card debt and you took the 212 dollar monthly payment and you invested it for 25 years at a long term rate of 12 you would have 404 373 at a 15 rate for 25 years if you invested that 212 a month you would have 700 594 at 17 you would have one million dollars 1 million 24 hundred and three dollars and if you study rental property or flipping homes or some other type of investment or business you could earn even more students at 18 years old if you were to invest a hundred dollars a month for 40 years at a long term rate of 12 percent you would have 1 million 200 thousand six hundred nine dollars by the age of fifty eight at a fifteen percent rate you'd have three million one hundred eighty thousand nine hundred seventy seven dollars by age fifty eight listen i want to help you today learn from the and save and invest for your future and i understand that going over these numbers can be overwhelming i'll be honest with you as i was writing this sermon i'm like oh lord carried a i don't know if i can do this listen here at people's church we want to help you you may not know this we have two financial small groups we have one it's for everyone meets every other thursday 7 p.m people that are smarter than me people that know and give you tools to get out of debt help you save help you invest help you to win financially we also have a financial small group just for married couples it's called marriage and money they're going to be meeting monthly listen jamie and i have needed help at times we've gone through small groups we've gone through people that are really wise with their money some family

number two pay you second you have to save before you pay your bills or you will never save get it in that savings get it out of your hand and then third pay them third pay god first save and then pay your bills all right and so i hope today this blesses you i want to help you win a lot of people have a lot of stress a lot of angst over their finances listen god created you to win in every area of your life and that includes your finances
UTHK6_Z3U1g,"well today we're continuing a series called Miracles nothing is too hard for God and the title of my message today is you are stuck in a season you shouldn't be in you are stuck in a season you shouldn't be in about a month ago I was in um Lafayette and I was needing to get lunch and saw one of the restaurants I like they have one of my favorite salads it has uh strawberries in it I like fruit in my salad anybody else like I like strawberries and apples and raisins and oranges and I pineapple I and so it was like it's like this salad it had like strawberry and pineapple and chicken and this and this dressing and you ever go someplace and you start thinking about what you're going to eat and and you get so you start salivating you know what I mean like I'm I'm almost Sal I was salivating I was excited I pulled up and got and got got out and I'm I'm I'm looking on the the menu and I'm not seeing my salad I'm like you know you can order online now so I'm let me look on the app they must have forgot I'm looking on the app they don't have my salad I well where's my strawberry salad it was seasonal why are you going to do that to a brother why are you gonna have a seasonal salad oh you ever been there you're excited and you go there and they didn't even have it because it was seasonal they decided to take it off the menu I was so disappointed you know one of the important principles to understand about life is that life is all about Seasons look at Ecclesiastes 31 it says for everything there is a season a time for every activity under heaven for everything there's a season and the Dilemma many people find themselves in is they get stuck in a season see you can make something permanent that God intended to be temporary that's what Israel did in the Old Testament God spoke to Moses and told him to lead Israel out of 400 years of slavery in Egypt God's plan was to take his people to the promised land look at Exodus 3:17 he says and I have promis to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites Hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites there a lot of IES a land flowing with milk and honey God brought Israel out of Egypt and was PR preparing to take them to the promised land to get to the promised land they had to go through the Wilderness the Wilderness was supposed to be an 11 day Journey to the promised land it was supposed to be a short season but an 11 day Journey ended up taking 40 years because Israel got stuck in a season see God God can have a promised land for your life but you're not prepared to receive it and so I want to show you a couple reasons why Israel got stuck for 40 years the first reason is this they did not believe God's word and God's promises look at numbers chap 14:1 it says the Lord said to Moses how long will these people treat me with content how long how long will they despise reject me is what he's saying he's saying how long will they refuse to believe in me in spite of all the signs I have performed among them no matter how many miracles God had provided for them they refused to believe in God's word and Promises they constantly doubted God doubted his word and doubted his promises and you will get stuck in a season when you don't believe the word of God God and the promises of God the second reason is this they grumbled and complained against the Lord look at Numbers chapter 26 through 29 the Lord said to Moses and Aaron how long will this wicked Community Grumble against me I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites so tell them as surely as I live declares the Lord I will do to you the very thing I heard you say in this Wilderness your bodies will fall every one of you 20 years old and more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me they got stuck in a season because they grumbled and complained against the Lord for 40 years they wandered in the wilderness they were stuck in a season that was not God's best or God's will for his people but God is such a good God that even in the wilderness he provided food for Israel for 40 years it was the miracle of Mana everybody say Mana it was the miracle of Mana God rained down Mana six days a week they ate bread from Heaven every day for 40 years something that was supposed to be temporary had become permanent Israel parked in a place that they were supposed to just pass through and some of you are exactly where Israel was you have made something permanent That was supposed to be temporary you've parked in a place that you're supposed to be passing through you've parked in a relationship or a friendship that was supposed to be temporary you've parked at a job that was supposed to be temporary you've parked in a place with your relationship with God that was supposed to be temporary you've parked in a place financially That was supposed to be temporary and what's interesting is that the place Israel parked was a place of Miracles even though it was not God's best for their life see just because you're experiencing a miracle doesn't mean you're experiencing God's best or even God's will Israel was literally living every day with a miracle but it wasn't God's best the promised land was God's best for them not the Wilderness and so after 40 years right before they entered the promis land I want you to see what happens look at John 5:12 it says the Mana stopped the day after they ate this food from the land there was no longer any Mana for the Israelites but that year they ate the produce of Canaan the miracle Mana stopped because this wasn't God's best for his people can you imagine that morning coming out of the tent yawning and look oh somebody done took my Mana uhhuh I knew who it was I bet you was that neighbor over there taking my Mana walked over to the tent I guess you can't really knock on a tent door so you just holler at people hey J thr J was like what man hey man you better get my Mana back he's like what are you talk talking about my Mana you didn't take it man didn't no way take your Mana go back to bed well can I borrow some Mana man I ate mine yesterday hold on a second then Jethro comes out and he's like hey man where's my Mana I take your Mana can you imag just imag the chaos and then people are like what are they fussing about Jeth row and Micah the talking mess again let me me get my mana and tell them to be quiet they come out there's no Mana oh who took the Mana y'all better empty your tents right now and can you imagine the chaos they blaming everybody to find out nobody took the Mana the Mana stopped no oh we going to starve listen the Mir Miracle Man it stopped listen the Mana was temporary not permanent they were never supposed to eat Mana for 40 years and some of you you're stuck in a Mana season you are stuck in a relationship that's taking you backwards you're stuck in a bad habit you're stuck in a job that isn't God's will you're stuck not growing your faith you're stuck living paycheck to paycheck you're stuck in in a season of not knowing how you're going to pay all your bills you're robbing Peter to pay Paul you're stuck not having a savings or retirement you're stuck not tithing and giving to God and you can be stuck in a season and experiencing Miracles but it not be God's best for Your Life Church God's best is the promised land God's trying to get you to the promised land don't park in a place that God intended for you to just be passing through don't make something permanent That was supposed to be temporary because at some point God will stop the Mana to get you to the promised land let me explain to you why the Mana stopped first it's because God's people need to go from Mana to maturity they need to go from Mana to maturity God didn't want his people to stay stuck in the Mana season for the rest of their life he wanted them to go to the promised land and he so they could work their cattle and work the sheep in the land so they could plant seed and produce crops and own homes living off Mana it will your growth you can get so dependent on the Mana that it stunts your development you stop maturing because you just want God to give you Mana but God's plan is for you to grow and mature look at 2 Peter 3:18 it says but grow everybody say grow but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be the glory both now and forever amen God doesn't want you to stay stuck in a Mana season he wants you to grow Ephesians 4:15 it says but speaking the truth in love may grow up in in all things into him who is the head Christ God wants you to grow up in all things and one of the greatest challenges for Israel and we Face the same challenge today as they got delivered out of Egypt but they needed to get Egypt delivered out of them they left Egypt but they still had the bad thinking and the defeated mindset the losing mindset a man of mindset a settling for less than God's best mindset matter of fact each Egypt was so ingrained inside of them they wanted to go back to Egypt they wanted to go back to slavery and bondage they're like we' just be better if we just go on back listen it's a horrible place to be when you're stuck in what God used to do and it's keeping you from what God wants to do let me ask you are you stuck in Egypt are you stuck in a Mana season are you stuck in your old ways are you stuck in what used to work are you stuck in bad thinking and fear and old habits are you stuck in Old friendships and old spending habits it's dangerous to stay stuck where God was you will miss out on the new season if you say if you stay stuck in the old one because you can't have the new and hold on to the old you got to stop don't stay parked in a place you're supposed to be passing through through you have to grow you have to develop you have to mature it's time for the Mana season to be over and it's time to go to the promised land why does the Mana stop secondly because you need to go from Mana to management the Wilderness is for Mana the promised land is for management it's a new season for Israel but the same Source both seasons require God and His favor but the management season looks completely different than the Mana season see the Mana didn't require much growth for Israel it didn't require much development and maturity they didn't have to exercise their faith they literally had to wake up crawl out of their tent ah grab the Mana crawl back into their tent and eat it that's all they had to do to get the Mana that's it no faith no working no maturing they could have just rolled over a couple times and grabbed the Mana outside of the tent but the management season requires more effort more more faith more growth more maturity more work you can't have the promised land without work without management and once God's people entered the promised land they had to take care of the cattle and sheep they had to plant crops and take care of them they had to take care of their home they had to buy clothes and wash clothes see during the Mana season they wore the same clothes there wasn't a place in the desert to buy clothes but there was no Prime in the Wilderness there was no Macy's there was no Goodwill there was no there was no department store no matter of fact the Bible says in Deuteronomy 8:4 your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell for these 40 days in the wilderness they ate Mana every day and their clothes never wore out it was a miracle but it wasn't God's best it wasn't God's will no no no the promised land was God's best was God's will but it will require management not just mana come on you got to manage your time better go to bed on time be early to work your appointments work hard you got to manage your health better take care of your health versus just asking for a miracle manage your relationships better don't just depend on a miracle invest in your relationships put work into them spend time work through the problems stop the drama pursue peace you got to manage your relationship you got to manage your relationship with God better every day pray read your Bible worship attend church every week tithe get in a small group serve uh attend 21 days of prayer and fasting January 7th through the 27th manage your relationship with God better you got you got to manage your money better pay your bills on time get out of debt save money get on a budget give money to the kingdom of God and to help others there are blessings and even Miracles that come from management but people want the miracle of the next season but they want to keep the thinking and the habits of the old season you can't allow Mana Seasons to become a lifestyle you can't live in the promised land without management you have to go from Mana to management and then why does the Mana stop number three because you need to go from Mana to movement one of the challenging things for people to wrap their mind around is how God will promise you something and then require you to to work to move to exercise your faith to inherit the promise Deuteronomy 1:8 it says see I have given you this land go in and take possession of the land the Lord swore he would give to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and to The Descendants after them just because God has given you a Promised Land doesn't mean it won't require movement action faithfulness and management to receive it I I want to give you four moves to make so you can live in the promised land come on y'all remember that buster move y some of yall don't know about that some of y'all anyway those were BC days before Christ but four moves to make so you can live in the promised land number one is this you have to remove some things in your life in Joshua 56-8 if if you read those passages God told Israel that they had to circumcise the men before they could go to the promised land there had to be a cutting away of Flesh before they could go into the promised land now under the New Covenant we have through Christ it's not the circumcision of Flesh that counts praise the lord it's the circumcision of the heart and yet some of you you have some things in your life they are hindering you from going to the promised land you have some bad habits some sin some junk some filth in your life that you need to cut away so that you can enter the promised land you have to remove some things from your life so that you can go from Mana to the promised land number two you have to March around some walls Joshua 6 2 and3 the Lord toward his people they had to March around the wall to take the city listen it will always require faith to take the promised land if you don't learn to march by faith you won't take the promised land if you have to understand everything God is telling you to do before you move you will miss the promised land god is asking some of you to take a step of Faith come on he's take God's asking some of you to take a step of faith in your relationships in your career in your church in your money and your Faith with God and you've been making excuses you need to start marching by faith you got to take some steps of faith in obeying God to enter the promised land number three you have to fight some battles Joshua 65 when you hear them sound a blast on the trumpets have the whole Army give a loud Shout then the wall of the city will collapse and the Army will go up everyone straight in God gave them the city but they still had to go into the city and fight some of you aren't entering the promised land because you want everything to be easy as soon as you face a struggle a test soon as you face opposition resistance you face something challenging you give up and quit listen if you want your marriage your children your family to get to the promised land you have to fight if you want your career to get to the promised land it's not all going to be easy you have to fight if you want your money to go to the promised land you have to fight got to fight to make a budget pay off debt and to save and give if you want your life to enter the Promised Land you have to fight it takes the good fight of Faith to live in the promised land and then number four you have to give to God what belongs to him Joshua chapter 6 verse 17-19 it says the city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the Lord only Rahab The Prostitute and all who are with her in the house shall be spared because she hid the spies we sent but keep away from the devoted things so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord and must go into his treasury we learned about this last sat or last Sunday it's the principle of the first if you missed that message go watch it on our YouTube page this was the first city that Israel conquered as they're taking the promised land and God said the first city belongs to me it was devoted to because to God because God always wants to be first if they gave God the first city he would bless the rest if they gave God the first City the rest would be blessed this is the principle of the first if you give God first he will bless the rest and some of you you aren't entering the promised land because you're ignoring the principle of the first you're putting god's second third or fourth place in your life you're keeping the devoted things to yourself but if you will put God first he'll bless the rest if you'll put God first he will bless your life if you will give God the if you'll give the devoted things to God he will bless the rest of your life and so listen I I want to help you today and so I just want to give you a couple steps here number one listen give God the first 10% of your income it's called the tithe the Bible tells every Christ follower to tithe to return 10% of their income to your church and so I want to encourage you today don't keep the devoted things don't put God second put God first and he will bless the rest start start start tithing today listen I know for some of you you could be you could have apprehension you could have tension you could be afraid man do I really do I do I give God first you could have some some nervousness about that and I want to encourage you to do the three-month tithe challenge we have the three-month tithe challenge it's a C it's in the seatback pocket near you and this tithe challenge is all about Malachi chapter 3 it's where God teaches us to return the tithe to him to the local church and he says test me in this would you test God and put them first would you test God and see and and here's the three-month tithe challenge we commit to you that if you tithe for three months and God doesn't hold true to his promise of blessings will refund 100% of your hi no questions asked would you step out in faith would you put God first don't keep the devoted things would you be consistent in your tithing and giving to God how Jamie and I are consistent as we have set up reoccurring giving so that as soon as we get paid the devoted things the first it goes to God automatically that of reoccurring giving Romans 128 talks about the gift of giving some of you have the gift of giving and I would love for you to find out more about our Legacy team and so if you're a tither and you have the gift of giving that Romans 128 talks about and you'd be interested in joining our Legacy team you could text PC Legacy to the number 940000 we're going to have a Christmas uh dinner for our Legacy team December the 10th Pastor Herbert will be here he'll be here all Sunday morning and then he'll be at the the the Christmas Legacy dinner and so if you want to be on the Legacy team text in sign up and we can give you more information at that dinner if you call People's Church your home listen if you're new with us today thank you so much for being here we're so glad that you're here and excited that you get to hear about just the vision and what God's doing at People's Church but we we're not asking you to give anything but if you call People's Church your home would you pray and would you ask God what he would have you give over and above your tithe to the miracle offering this year for the miracle offering we're believing for a miracle offering of$ 750 $750,000 and when you leave today we'll have a little brochure that we'll give you and on the back of the brochure it shows you where that giving goes 300,000 goes to all of our missions efforts like Lyn wheeler missionary to Costa Rica and all the other missionaries and missionary organizations we support locally locally uh nationally uh and internationally and and then 450,000 is going to go to a permanent building we currently lease this building but we want to buy a permanent building in a prime location you're like pastor you'all already got the building no but God does oh so you want me to give to a building you don't have yet yes come on how you know it takes real Faith to give to something you don't even own yet but I'm telling you all I'm asking you is would you you pray would you ask God what youd have you give matter of fact in the brochure you'll see what you've already given towards our building that we're going to have you'll see all the other missions efforts and what not and what God's doing and what we're believing for in 20124 and so when you leave today we'll give you one of these brochures we're not doing a normal dreambuilder one-year dreambuilder commitment like we've done in the past we're simply doing the miracle offering this year and we're believing and praying and asking God that as we pray and ask and give we give $750,000 here's what I've learned jam and I we've tithed our entire life we've always given above the tithe generously we've always given to the miracle offering but it was about 15 years ago God really convicted me because when I was given to a miracle offering I would go and look at my savings and checking account before I even prayed and asked God what to give and there was just one time just God convicted me he said Chris is it really requiring your faith to go look there before you come talk to me and I was like well not really and so 15 years ago now again you should know where your money is right so I mean I know what I got but you know I mean some sometimes you just checking okay so listen if I give this much what's that I I don't do that anymore I just pray and ask God what would you have us give and there's some times I'm like Lord I don't know if that's you I got to talk to Jamie I got to Lord and praise God I got a a woman of Faith as my wife she's like where the checkbook let's write it I'm like oh Jesus here we go but you know what God's always been faithful we've written checks we never thought we'd be able to write it's all God it's all God it's all his and so all I'm asking if you call People's Church your home would you just ask would you pray would you obey that's it it's all his God's going to take care of it and I believe as we all ask and pray God's going to do a miracle through our offering why to see more change lives to see one more person come to know Jesus to see one more person one more family one more child one more teenager join the family of God to know that one more person gave their life to Jesus and they're not going to spend eternity away from God in a place called hell but they're going to spend eternity in heaven forever put God first and he'll bless the rest put him first in your finances he'll bless the rest put him first in your relationships he'll bless the rest put him first in your marriage he'll bless the rest put him first in your family and your children he'll bless the rest put them first in your career put them first with your time put them first with your talent and he will bless the rest don't get stuck in a Mana season let's mature let's get some movement and go to his will his plan the Promised Land"
5vikyOpSqH8,well today we're continuing our series we've been in this uh a month now in this series on uh the Holy Spirit and I would encourage you if you have missed uh any week to go on our YouTube page get caught up we're learning so much we're calling it reintroducing The Holy Spirit and the title of my message today is are you led by flesh or fruit are you led by flesh or fruit in this series we've learned that when you give your life to Christ you become a child of God you are born again and immediately the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of you according to Ephesians 1 13 and when the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of you he brings his fruit and gifts with him but the Fruit of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit they are in the the seed they're in a baby stage and they need to grow and be developed in your life look what First Peter 1 23 says it says for you have been born again not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the living and enduring word of God so the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of you at Salvation and he brings the seed of the fruit and gifts of the Spirit but to flourish as a Christ follower the seed needs to grow First John 3 9 it says no one who was born of God will continue to sin because God's seed remains in them they cannot go on sinning because they have been born of God John says that when the Holy Spirit and his seed of the Fruit of the Spirit come to live inside someone at Salvation there will be a change in their life you can't have the Holy Spirit living inside of you and not see some kind of change in your life now it may not be overnight but there will be a change in your life this doesn't mean that you'll be sinless but you will sin less the holy spirit's job is to produce his fruit in your life and the goal is for your life to be led by the fruit of the spirit rather than by your flesh but the problem is your flesh always wants what's contrary to the Fruit of the Spirit see when you become a Christian your flesh is stronger than the fruit because you've been living in the flesh for years your flesh has been leading your life for years and the goal is that the fruit would grow in your life so that you stop following your flesh and you start following the spirit look at Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 through 23 it says so I say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh for the flesh desires what is contrary to the spirit and the spirit what is contrary to the flesh they are in conflict with each other so that you are not to do whatever you want but if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law the acts of the flesh are obvious sexual immorality impurity debauchery idolatry and Witchcraft hatred Discord jealousy fits of Rage selfish ambition dissensions factions and envy drunkenness orgies and the like I warn you as I did before for those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace forbearance kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control against such things there is no law let me ask you is your life producing the acts of the flesh or the Fruit of the Spirit what's growing in your life flesh or fruit what's winning in your life flesh or fruit what's controlling your life flesh or fruit I have this glass of dirty water this is dirty water this is me and you even after we give our life to Jesus because this is our flesh when we give our life to Jesus all our sins are forgiven instantly but how many you know our issues don't go away instantly how many know we still got desires and flesh and we will you you know what I mean and all of you you can get saved and and you drive and home from church and somebody cuts you off and bumps you in a little bit of that dirty water you start cussing folks out on the road you're like oh what in the world you know what I mean because even though we just got so we still got our flesh and so we still may be struggling with lying and gossiping lust and and cussing and all that stuff because because if we've been led by our flesh for so long but here's what God wants to do okay he wants to take his spirit and so here we have the spirit let's see how good I am the clear stuff this is the spirit and when you give your life to Jesus you still got the flesh but your spirit is inside of you and God wants to develop the fruit of the spirit he wants to develop it he wants to pour it out and so look what happens when God pours his Spirit when he develops the fruit of the spirit in your life foreign I can't tell with the lights we still got some dirty listen and sometimes it doesn't all go away and you got to keep pouring and pouring and pouring and then all of a sudden now when you get bumped you maybe think about cussing somebody out but instead you stretch your hand and you pray for them Lord touch that touch because you got the fruit of the spirit it's been growing and it's developing and God's been molding and shaping and that Spirit has filled you up with its fruit and it's replacing the flesh so that your desires are lived to live by the spirit and not by the flesh and so I want to share with you three interesting facts about the fruit of the spirit number one is this Christ followers do not have all the gifts of the Spirit but do have all the fruit of the spirit let me explain the fruit of the spirit is different from the gifts of the Spirit the Bible is clear that the gifts of the Spirit are given out by the Holy Spirit as he sees fit not everyone will get every gift First Corinthians 12 7 a spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other first Corinthians 12 11 it is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts he alone decides which gift each person should have so here's what the Bible's saying the Holy Spirit decides who he's going to give the gifts of the Spirit he decides who he's going to give the gift of healing wisdom knowledge Discerning Spirits he decides who he's going to give the gift of tongues not your personal prayer language the but but tongues that will be interpreted in a service he's the one that desires who determines who gets the gift of the interpretation of tongues or the gift of Prophecy the holy spirit will give you a gift he'll give you two or three gifts and not every person receives all the gifts the Holy Spirit decides which gifts you get and don't get but the fruit of the spirit is different if you're a Christian you have all of the fruit of the spirit let me share with you a second interesting fact number two they are called the fruit of the spirit not the fruit of the spirit Galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the spirit at Salvation you get the fruit not the fruits of the spirit meaning when you get one you get all there are nine characteristics that make up the fruit of the spirit and it's easy for people to think they can get some of the fruit and not get some of it well I praise the Lord I got the kind kiwis and the loving lemons oh but I did not get those patient pair or those gentle grapes no no no you get all the fruit and it contains all nine characteristics but all the characteristics of the fruit of the spirit are in seed form they're in the baby stage that's why you can be saved have fruit in you and still be a jerk your kindness is in seed form baby form it hasn't grown but just because it you don't see it manifested in your life doesn't mean that the seed isn't there if you're a Christian you have all of the fruit of the spirit but you need the fruit to grow in your life here's the third interesting fact your fruit matters to God and it should matter to you most people don't realize how much their fruit matters it's big to Jesus and it should be big to You Look what Jesus says in Matthew 7 verse 17 through 20. he says likewise every good tree Bears good fruit but a bad tree Bears Bad fruit a good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown to the fire thus by their fruit you will recognize them Jesus Says by their fruit your fruit matters Look what Jesus says in Matthew 12 33. he says make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and his fruit will be bad for a tree is recognized by its fruit come on look at your neighbor tell them your fruit matters oh yeah your fruit matters I almost wanted to get a little Tutti Frutti I don't know it just hit me for a second your fruit matters Luke chapter 6 verse 43 and for Good Tree Bears Bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit each tree is recognized by its own fruit people do not pick figs from Thorn bushes or grapes from Briars and so today and next week I want to talk with you about the nine characteristics of the fruit of the spirit and so today we're going to get into five of them next week we'll cover uh the other four and then next week I also want to give you the number one reason why the fruit isn't growing in your life I want to show you how to get your fruit growing in your life your fruit can't stay in baby or teenage days your fruit has to get growing and I'm telling you when your fruits start growing it will change your life and so let's look at the five characteristics the first one is love everybody say love it's not surprising that love is at the top of the list love is not only a characteristic of the fruit of the spirit but it's also the motivation behind all of the other eight the Greek word for love here is agape everybody say agape agape love is the highest form of love in the Greek language it's a selfless sacrificial pure form of love it's the kind of love that Jesus has for all Humanity Romans 5 8 but God showed his great love his great Agape Love For Us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still Sinners while we were still sinners Christ died for us this is agape love it's an unconditional love humans tend to have love that's conditional I'll love you if I like you I love you if I agree with you if you agree with me I love you if you do what I want I'll love you if you treat me right sure I love you fleshly love is conditional but the kind of love the Holy Spirit wants to produce in US is agape love a selfless sacrificial unconditional pure love this is what the world needs to see from Christ's followers unconditional agape love look at John 13 verse 34-35 and so as Jesus said so now I am giving you a new commandment love each other just as I have loved you you should love each other your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples the world needs to see the church loving each other otherwise the church looks just like the world and the world says oh y'all can't get along you all need to hate each other hate each other over politics and covid and skin color and so many other things and my prayer is oh God let People's Church be a church that continues to grow in Agape unconditional love the fruit of love that will continue to love one another Lord help us to live a life of love this is massive look at First Corinthians 16 14. it says let all that you do be done in love first Peter 4 8 above all keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins Colossians 3 4 and above all else put on love which binds everything together in Perfect Harmony Maya Angelou said we need joy as we need air we need love as we need air we need each other as we need the Earth we share come on we need each other we need to love one another we need to be devoted to one another in love Romans 12 10 be devoted to one another in love and one of the ways the Bible encourages us to be devoted to one another in Love Is by being committed to gathering together to strengthen encourage care support celebrate and help each other grow closer to God and at People's Church we do this through small groups our small groups launch fall launch is September the 10th and I'm asking every one of you that led a spring group let a summer group remember you also lead a fall group I'm asking those of you in this room that aren't leading a group would you lead a group I can't think of a greater love than helping another brother or sister find Jesus grow in their relationship with God to get face to face to get in somebody's life to disciple them you know Jesus preached to the crowds but he discipled the twelve he discipled the three come on who are your 12 who are your three I know some of you think well I'm Not Jesus okay that's fine who are your seven who are your two but man would you sign up you can text in to go to one of our trainings we got it on the screen would you sign up for a small group leader training God wants to use you would you gather with some other believers come once you come together pray together maybe you go running or jogging or play a sport and then you're praying to God that there's just so many different ways to do life together but we can grow so much more face to face let's be devoted to one another let's be devoted in love to one another to serve one another care for one another pray for one another one of the best ways we do that is through small groups let's be devoted to one another in love here's the second characteristic joy everybody say Joy Maya Angelou said we need joy as we need air and that's the truth it's biblical Joy is a characteristic of the Fruit of the Spirit in a world full of Sorrow anxiety depression worry we can have the joy of the Lord that comes only from the Holy Spirit see Joy is something a lot of Christ followers are chasing after rather than allowing the Holy Spirit to develop inside of them let me say that again a lot of us we are chasing Joy we're chasing after it instead of allowing the Holy Spirit to develop Joy inside of us the Holy Spirit wants to produce joy in your life Romans 14 17 for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness of peace and joy in the Holy Spirit come on look at your neighbor and say God wants to put some Joy inside of you oh yeah God wants to put some Joy inside of you Romans 15 13 it says may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace and believing so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in Hope Oh God produce the joy of the Lord in our hearts number three is peace everybody say peace peace doesn't mean you're in a place where there's no trouble pain heartache hard work loss lack disappointment or grieving no no peace is being in the midst of all those things and having a calmness in your heart don't let people problems and the powers of Darkness pull you into their storm no no you pull them into your peace the Holy Spirit wants to produce this kind of peace in your heart oh god grow our peace develop peace number four is patience everybody say patience patience is the ability to suffer to wait to endure with a good attitude the Holy Spirit produces patience in the Christ follower what comes easy won't last what lasts won't come easy God give us patience Edmund Burke said our patience will achieve more than our Force there are many things you can only receive in the kingdom of God by developing the fruit of patience look at Hebrews 6 12. it says we do not want you to become lazy but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised the promises of God are inherited by faith and patience Holy Spirit give us patience when our money is funny Holy Spirit give us patience when our physical mental and emotional health is unstable give us patience when our family is acting crazy give us patience when the problems are piling up oh Lord give us patience when people are acting like knuckleheads God give us patience so we can inherit the promises for our lives and then number five is kindness everybody say kindness we live in a world where Christians justify not growing in kindness we give ourselves a pass and we make excuses for being harsh for being short with people we make excuses for being annoyed with people my boss wasn't just a jerk I wouldn't have said what I said I mean you know they learn to be a little nicer maybe I'll be a little I mean I don't understand me I'm being overlooked taking advantage of me I had to give him a piece of my mind I mean if they weren't getting on my nerves oh it just rubbed me the wrong way they're too loud they're too quiet what you looking at boo if they weren't looking at me crazy I oh God develop kindness kindness in our hearts Ephesians 4 32 it says be kind to each other tender-hearted forgiving one another just as God through Christ Jesus has forgiven you Colossians 3 12 it says therefore as God's chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness kindness kindness First Corinthians 13 4 love is patient love is kind someone once said kindness is a passport that opens doors Fashions friendships softens hearts and molds relationships that can last a lifetime our days are better when we give people a piece of our heart instead of giving them a piece of our mind God help us God we're asking you produce kindness in our hearts next Sunday we're going to look at the other four characteristics of the Fruit of the Spirit and then I'm going to show you how to grow your fruit some of you aren't seeing the Fruit of the Spirit growing in your life and I'm going to show you what's hindering your fruit from growing and I'ma teach you how to grow your fruit but as we close here I want to give you the fruit evaluator every one of us can just look at our life and when it comes to love joy peace patience kindness are we living by the flesh or are we living by the fruit flesh or fruit and just rank yourself one would be poor ten would be great and as we do this exercise we can ask the Holy Spirit to develop whatever area we're straggling or luggling in whatever maybe we still got an infant's seed it's just the seed it's the baby stage and we can ask God to take our love to the next stage our joy our peace our patience our kindness to the next level to the next stage
RRdtRK_xpWw,"well today we are kicking off this brand new series called angels and demons and I'll be honest with you before I was a Christian if somebody were to someone were to ask me about angels and demons my only reference point would probably be movies and books you know I I I I when I was a teenager before I gave my heart to Christ um I loved uh horror movies I loved watching scary movies and some of them I just you know that they weren't a big deal they didn't scare me that ones but the ones that dealt with people being possessed by a demon I think I watched a lot of those during daytime I I wasn't so sure about watching those at nighttime or if I did maybe I slept with the light on you know what I mean I'm teenager with a a nightl matter of fact I remember one night I was in my I was living with my my dad and um I watched I can't even remember what I watched but it was one of those kinds of movies and um I went to bed and I turned the light off and um it was a a three-bedroom house and my sister was uh staying and she was in the other bedroom and uh I'm you know I'm trying to go to sleep and get my mind right and all of a sudden I hear her talking and I'm like Stephanie what are you talking about and she wouldn't respond to me and it was like she was just like mumbling under her breath and I'm like and it stopped I'm like okay okay I'm go go to sleep and then she started doing it again I'm like I ain't about to go in there y' I just watch this movie Lord you know what I did I turned my light on cuz I just knew it I was just waiting for her to come she was a like a middle school age you know that's like the scariest it's like the kids you know what I mean and I just picture her walking into my room Christopher you know eyes Blazing Red I'm like a let's just say I didn't sleep very well that night but I think for a lot of people when it comes to Angels and Demons most of what they know is probably coming from some sort of Hollywood script and while some people are overly interested and preoccupied with angels demons and spiritual warfare the truth is is that most people rarely if ever think of the Unseen World or they assume if they can't see it then it's not real but just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not real look what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 6: 10-12 it says finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil schemes for our struggle is not against flesh and blood what seen But against the rulers against the authorities and against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the Heavenly Realm the Unseen 2 Corinthians 4:18 says so we fix our eyes not on what is seen But on what is unseen since what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal it's critical that we not only acknowledge that there is an Unseen World but that it's more important than the seen world and we should give serious thought to how it impacts our lives and what we're supposed to do scripture makes it clear that the Unseen has tremendous impact on the scene and that's why we're doing this series not to bring a preoccupation with angels or demons but our biggest Miss tends to be downplaying them and being unaware and so today as we kick off this series to set the T table we're going to begin with an introductory look at Angels there are over 300 references in the Bible about angels so the Bible has a lot to say and some of it may surprise you there are some incredible stories lots of action and drama but also a lot of insights I'm telling you you don't want to miss a single week of this series and so let's jump in and begin with some of the most frequently asked questions about angels and we will get all of our answers from the Bible and I'll warn you in advance some of this may surprise you and of most of you Mo know about angels again like I did from Hollywood movies or books prepare to have your perceptions shattered this is going to be fun so number one the first question is what is an angel well Webster dictionary says an angel is a spiritual being serving as a Divine messenger and intermediary and often as a special protector of an individual or Nation now while Webster's Dictionary can be helpful we want to look at it even greater Authority and see what God's word says and when you you read scripture it's clear that angels are indeed messengers of for God and Servants of God we also see that there are different types of angels and they're used for different purposes and we're going to be looking closely at the different types of of angels and I believe you're going to find it very interesting but in the most General sense there are angels and fallen angels and those fallen angels are properly known known as demons and since today is an introduction and an overview we're going to primarily focus on Angels this week one and so I won't take long on this but it is important to note that demons started as angels in heaven until a third of them rebelled with Satan and we're going to another week in this series we're going to get into Satan and his fall and we're going to get in uh uh uh more in to Demons but it's important to know that there are bad Angels also referred to as fallen angels and most commonly demons but today we're going to talk about the good Angels the ones that worship and serve God as they carry out his will they are powerful Spiritual Beings and we're going to see in a few minutes that there are a lot of them okay and so here's the second question are angels created beings the short answer is yes they were created by God Nehemiah 9:6 it says you alone are the Lord you made the skies and the heavens and all the stars you made the earth and the Seas and everything in them you preserve them all and the angels of heaven Worship You Colossians chapter 1:1 15 and 16 it says Christ is the visible image of the invisible God he existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation for through him God created everything in the Heavenly Realms and on Earth he made the things we can see and the things we can't see such as Thrones kingdoms rulers and authorities in the Unseen World everything was created through him and for him and so there are Spiritual Beings not human beings but at times they appear in human form look what Hebrews 13:2 says it sayso not forget to show Hospitality to strangers for by doing so some people have shown Hospitality to Angels without knowing it so based on Hebrews is possible that you've had an actual interaction with an angel and didn't even know about it matter of fact I've heard stories from some of my family I've heard it from friends and people I didn't even know how someone showed up at the right time the right place the right thing and then they just disappeared and so whether you've heard the same whether you've heard it on a show or somewhere else the stories are endless and I don't think you have to believe every story you hear but we do know from scripture that angels are real and they are involved in the work of the Lord and sometimes they appear in human in form here's here's another question number three here are angels male or female we tend to think of angels as women right she sings Like An Angel she's so lovely she looks like an angel come on maybe you use this one somebody better call God because he's missing an angel how you doing you know what I mean you you you use one of those to but interestingly and I'm sorry ladies but the only indication from scripture is that they are male anytime you see an angel in the Bible it is referred to as he and with over 300 references in the script scripture none of them is ever referred to as a woman so ladies that line is yours somebody better call God he missing an angel hey you if you're single you may try it you never know only two of them are referenced by name first there's Gabriel known as messenger he came to Zechariah in Luke 1 to tell him that his wife would bear a child in her old age Luke 1:19 it says and the angel said to him I am Gabriel I stand in the presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news and then there's Michael known as a warrior referenced as being the archangel June one or Jude 1 8-9 it says in the very same way on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies reject Authority and Heap abuse on Celestial beings but even the Archangel Michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said the Lord rebuke you here's another question how many angels are there the Bible doesn't give one specific number but it does indicate that there are a lot Hebrews 12 12:22 no you have come to Mount Zion to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to countless thousands of Angels in a joyful Gathering Revelation 511 then I looked and heard the voice of many angels numbering thousands upon thousands and 10,000 times 10 thousands they circled the throne and the living creatures and the elders in the Book of Daniel when God was holding Court in heaven it says in Daniel 7:10 millions of angels ministered to him many millions stood to attend him then the court began its session and the books were open you want talk about Collective power Millions upon millions of angelic beings all carrying out the work of God matter of fact if you read 2 Kings 19 God sent one of his angels to carry out judgment on the Assyrians that had defiled God and the scripture says that just one Angel destroyed 185,000 Assyrians come on aren't you glad that when you're facing difficulties and problems in this life you don't have to do it on your own that as a child of God you have access to an omnipotent all powerful one who can dispatch one of his millions of angels to help you here's the next question should we worship Angels now scripture is clear we should not we worship God Alone not his Messengers in Revelation 1910 the right John encountered an angel and it says then I fell down at his feet to worship him but he said no don't worship me I am a servant of God just like you and your brothers and sisters who testify about their faith in Jesus worship only God we don't worship them they are Servants of God not God themselves here here's a question that a lot of people want to know do we have Guardian Angels anybody ever called somebody their Guardian Angel everybody I know I did I had my appendix taken out um and this was later in life I was an adult married to Jamie and I guess when I was coming out of the anesthesia I looked at Jamie I said you're my guardian angel I don't remember that that's what she told me cuz truth be known when my stomach was feeling funny Jamie was like we were having to go back home to Oklahoma City and that's about an 11h hour drive and she's like your stomach's fine you just got some gas let's get on the road and go back home if I would have listen to her I might not be here right now but she's still an angel well maybe not cuz none of them are girls but I love her dearly but I'm sure we've all been there we called somebody our Guardian Angel and while scripture doesn't explicitly say each person has a guardian angel there are a couple of verses people reference that some think they suggest that we do Matthew 18:10 it says beware that you don't look down on any of these little ones for I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly father acts 12:15 it says you're out of your mind they told her when she kept insisting that it was so they said it must be his Angel you know probably the greatest case for Guardian Angels is some of y'all know the way that you drive and you are still alive come on you some of you can testify you got two or three of them guardian angels with you on the road many many a times but we do know that God sends his angels to minister to his people like he did with Elijah and like he did with Jesus when he was tempted and we'll go deeper on these we're going to talk about angels in a couple of our our our sermons and uh other we're going to answer other questions regarding Angels like is there anything we can do to discharge angels on our behalf but before we go I want to answer probably the most important question it's this why do we really need to know about angels why do we really need to know about angels you know these may be some of the most frequently asked questions that we've covered today and some of them may be intriguing and interesting but this study is much more than satisfying curiosity and I want to give you three reasons why we really need to know about angels the first is this we can't understand everything but should strive to understand everything we can church family we can't afford to be nonchalant or apathetic about such a critical topic the spiritual realm is real it's more real than we can imagine and just because there's a mystery to it and things that we don't fully understand that's no excuse to be flippant about it and whether we want to or not we will be influenced by movies books and anything else this natural world uses to paint a picture of Angel and demons matter of fact Satan wants to give you a false picture so that you won't know the truth he has a goal to wreck your family he wants to destroy your life he has a strategy and structure to his attack and while we don't have to be afraid we must be aware so that we can take our stand Paul said to the Corinthians we don't want to be unaware of the devil's schemes so I encourage you don't miss a sing single week if you can help it we're going to learn so much in this series the second reason why we really need to know about angels is it gives us insight into God's way and how he works even for us as Christians we can be so accustomed to the ways of this natural world that God's ways seems strange to us and the more we study his Mo word the more we we understand his ways and when we see how he created the Angels how he deals with Satan Rebellion how he uses his Messengers and how they worship him all of that teaches us about God any topic that is referenced over 300 times in scripture is obviously there because God is wanting to teach us something it's never been his plan that we would live our lives unfamiliar with the Supernatural and number three the third reason why do we really need to know about angels it gives us insight into the spirit world the spiritual battle and how to win listen this is a fight that you didn't sign up for we're in it whether we want to be or not we've chosen to follow God rather than rebel against him but the devil and his demons aren't giving up and we don't need to be afraid of losing but we need to be aware of God's plan and how to live in Victory how do we learn to use the word of God so that it isn't just a book we read but it's a weapon we use if we don't learn to use it we have no defense against the devil's attack his word it's a sword as part of the armor of God how do we learn to pray powerful prayers that move the hand of God not just religious mumbo jumbo but prayers that bring about spiritual breakthroughs and break bondage and set people free and bring Revelation what do we do when the devil attacks our marriage our children our health our peace when all hell is coming against you are you helpless and hopeless no because as followers of Jesus Christ we are living from Victory because of the cross of Jesus Christ we know that we don't have to be intimidated or afraid of demonic forces because greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world and if your spiritual eyes aren't open and you can't see it you'll be tempted to live and fear or to miss what God wants to show you and how he wants to work when you're aware you don't have to be afraid when you're unaware there's plenty of reason to be afraid and we're committed to learning God God's word and learning to fight the good fight we can be bold and have peace no matter the circumstances we face in this broken world we serve a God who is Con in control of all things he is above all things and nothing makes him Flinch you can know today that you have enemies you may feel like hell has you surrounded but God can send one Angel to destroy anything and every everything trying to take you down and if he needs to send one more he has millions upon Millions God has you covered there is an Unseen World there is a spiritual battle there will be a lot of things that we don't understand about it but there's also a good amount that we can understand that we can have Victory and we can overcome an attack of the devil or any demon or anything coming against us with the word of God that God can send his angels that God is fighting for us and on our behalf in this unseed world God has you covered"
wvBXonpKlJU,well today we are continuing our series on the Holy Spirit and if you've missed any of these weeks I would really encourage you to go to our YouTube page you can search People's Church Indianapolis we've been learning so much about the Holy Spirit and we're going to continue uh to learn more about the Holy Spirit but um don't want you to miss any of it especially if you don't know a lot about the Holy Spirit the person who he is and the work he wants to do in and through your life and so as we continue that today the title of my message today is baptized and blessed baptism Sunday is one of my favorite Sundays of the Year matter of fact today we have already baptized 15 people come on can we thank God that's a big deal y'all I don't want that number just that 15 people nine in this service come on give it up for all nine in this service got baptized went public with their faith man we are so so proud of you it reminds me of our very first baptism we were meeting at Fall Creek Valley Middle School we had grand opening in August and in September we did a a baptism bash we did them outside and uh I remember we were like all right but man how are we gonna get water to this tub and we started you know the school had uh you know spigots on the outside but none of them were working like we're gonna have some water if we gonna baptize some people and so there's actually a company that drives around a tanker of water and they will come and they'll fill up whatever you need to fill them up so we called up that company and they pulled up that big truck and uh they they put the the holes in the in the tub and in the tank and I mean 10 seconds that bad boy was full gushing water the problem was um it wasn't heated water so folks were getting in that water and people thought the Lord was touching them they were like oh people like oh the Lord and man Hallelujah no yo that water was freezing that's they would like baptize me and give me up out of here I was like man hey ever since then ever since then we always try to make sure we got that water warm lukewarm nice for you uh I remember when I got baptized 18 years old I remember being anxious I remember the nerves I remember my stomach uh being a little in knots and um just remember being in that water and just being so thankful for Jesus who saved my soul save me forgave me of all of my sins I remember tears that day they were just tears of joy and tears of gratitude today I'll never forget and today I want to take you to a passage of scripture where the Holy Spirit shows up at Jesus's baptism it's In this passage that we see all three persons of the Trinity God the Father God the son and God the Holy Spirit and I think it also highlights the significance of water baptism look at Matthew chapter 3 verse 13 through 17. it says then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John but John tried to talk him out of it I am the one who needs to be baptized by you he said so why are you coming to me John's like hold up you're Jesus I'm not supposed to baptize you you're supposed to baptize me you know I mean that's like Peyton Manning coming up to you and saying hey I need some help with my throwing form can you can you can you teach me how to throw a football you know what I mean it's like Reggie Miller asking for some help with his free throws or Steph Curry asking you know I just need can you just help me with my three-point shot I just you know it's like it's like Einstein asking for help with his math homework you know what I mean you're like no you're the expert in this I'm not supposed to show you look what it says in verse 15. it says but Jesus said it should be done for we must carry out all that God requires and so John agreed to baptize him I think it's interesting to know that these are the first words of Jesus since he was a 12 year old if you aren't familiar with your Bible when Jesus was 12 that's when his parents lost him so parents take courage even the parents of Jesus how are you going to lose Jesus you know what I mean like at all they Lauder like where is he and he's like I was in my father's house I was doing my father's business Jesus at 12 was on Mission and here he is he's around 30 years old he is still on Mission and this is a profound moment he's around 30 years old and he's about to launch into his public Ministry and he goes to get baptized before he launches off into his public Ministry he gets baptized this is so very significant verse 16 it says after his baptism as Jesus came up out of the water the heavens were opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him and a voice from Heaven said this is my dearly loved Son who brings me great joy I want us to see from this passage the connection between the anointing of the Holy Spirit and Jesus's baptism and when we talk about water baptism I understand that concept may be newer to some of you like what does it even mean like man is there something special in that water like what but let me just help you what it's not mystical and it's not theologically complex it's just a picture it's a picture it's like when you see somebody waving a white flag it's a picture what does that mean it means that they surrender or maybe let's just be a little bit more relevant today sometimes we just send an emoji we're trying to communicate an emotion or a feeling or a message or my emoji folks out here got any folks you like using emojis you're like I don't even have to use words I just use my emojis and I I use emojis I'll show you a couple mines so here's one of the Emojis I like to use I'm around some funny people in my life so they you will get this one quite often if you even if it's a little funny you'll get that I am crying uh laughing at what you're saying you'll get the cry laughing one when when when you when you send me something funny uh my brother he's always my brother-in-law he's always sending me these little secret videos and these reels uh on on Instagram and he gets a lot of he gets a lot of those emojis and so uh here here's another Emoji uh was anybody using one this week oh I got hot y'all hey I was in Oklahoma it was over a hundred and the wind blowing not a Cool Wind okay it was like walking around somebody following you with a blow dryer just blow just hot on your face like disrespectful it was so it was hot it was hot uh how about this next Emoji here anybody ever use this one everybody in it you know what I mean when I used to have to change diapers that was an emoji that I might use or actually the first time I had sushi I went and uh a guy was like man you gotta try this one it is amazing and it looked good y'all it looked delicious okay but it had eel on it okay I took I put it in my mouth the minute I tasted it my stomach turned um I couldn't even swallow no joke I ran to the bathroom and spit it out my stomach was just turned ugh disgusting that was I just would have I would have uh just sent that emoji and here's another Emoji oh yeah you know the crying Emoji you know that's my my little boy Cohen is going to kindergarten he's going to be in full-time School me and Jamie will be posting this Emoji to all our friends and family you know just the tears uh streaming down here's here's another emoji that maybe you do here you go I don't care what anybody says you get this Emoji for me you getting prayed for that is not a high five those are prayer hands in the name of Jesus okay you get that for me I'm not giving you a high five I'm praying for you that's what those are those are prayer hands all right and then this last one here oh yeah you know what I mean you get that text Jamie's like I'm making your favorite dinner you know I'm making steak or something you just drooling you know what I mean you just excited matter of fact I I told Pastor Herbert he is a huge uh Sushi connoisseur he loves Sushi and he said he said you just need to come to my sushi place and I'm like man I'm telling you Pastor I'm just not a sushi guys I would just come to my place I gotta roll you're gonna like and I'm like oh Lord so we go and it's called the Sumo roll all right and right away when they bring it out there's salmon on top of it I don't like salmon I don't eat salmon my wife all the time she's like Chris this salmon is like butter I'm like no it's like salmon and I'm like pastor I told you what happened I'm at least swallow it okay but I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a shot and I don't know if the Lord touched this sushi but it was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten oh I ate the whole row you know roll it like it's like eight of them there I was now don't judge me I had to use my Fork I can't quite do the Chopsticks but nonetheless with that spicy mayo oh I tore right there if he invites me to get some sushi I'm I'm sending them to drooly Emoji yes the Sumo roll let's do it see water baptism is a physical picture of a spiritual reality it's a physical picture of a spiritual reality a person is immersed in water symbolizing being dead and buried to their old sinful life and then they come up out of the water symbolizing their fresh new life in Christ and people who have been baptized tell you how meaningful it is I mean you got to see the folks that got baptized today some With Tears in their eyes some felt a weight was lifted you see the joy the Gratitude the the excitement it is a wonderful mile marker in the life of a Christian and what's surprising is that a lot of people who attend church have never been baptized and so let me share with you some reasons people don't get baptized first reason is this is that they don't see the importance of it now I don't believe people are trying to be rebellious they just didn't realize it was a big deal this is my story my parents had me baptized as a baby they did a little sprinkle on me and and and so when someone asked me have you been baptized I'm like yeah I was baptized as a baby and they were like oh he's like well have you have you chosen to be baptized yourself no I'm good right but I'm a new Christian I didn't even understand and then they started to show me in the scripture everywhere you read in the Bible someone was baptized after they made a personal decision to follow Jesus then they made a personal decision to get water baptized and so when I saw that in the scripture that oh man after you give your life to Jesus you're you're to take the next step in getting water baptized once I saw it in the Bible and what it taught I was like sign me up I was signed up for the very next but I just didn't know I didn't have an understanding I was ignorant to what the Bible the Bible taught like what my parents said that was their decision I had no choice over that but I realized that water baptism comes after you make a decision to follow Jesus and then you take the next step to be water baptized and so when I learned it was eye-opening for me and so a lot of times people can have an un uh biblical perspective on baptism and and they choose not to get baptized I've heard people say well I'm just not ready and I'm like the only reason you would not be ready to get baptized is if you're not a Christian if you're not a Christian you're not ready to get baptized but if you give your life to Jesus the moment you give your life to Jesus you're ready to get baptized but we can start to believe things that the Bible doesn't even teach and it can hold us back from having this incredible encounter and taking this amazing next step in our faith journey and so again some people they don't get baptized because they don't even really know or even understand what the Bible says about it uh another reasons people don't get baptized is they allow Pride to keep them from being baptized maybe they've been saved a long time and they don't want the people to see them just now getting baptized oh man well people what would they think of me like I've been living for the lord well they think I'm doing I did something wrong or whatever first of all who cares what people think right the only one we should care about is the Lord and what he thinks all right and if you're a Christian you've given your life to Christ it's not like you forfeited it or you missed it oh man I didn't get baptized within the six-month window of getting baptized after salvation guess I should never no it doesn't even exist right you just you should do it but Pride can hold us back and we're worried about what people think hey Pride can hold people back because they thinking about their hair like I just got this hair done Pastor Chris I know you ain't got no hair on your head but do you know what it cost all right you're gonna talk about something about Hey listen we got hair nets it's all good we got stocking we got the hair the Caps you know what I mean but Pride all of a sudden we're we're worried about what people think or our hair getting messed up or our makeup I don't want to be wet in front of everybody and practice and pride Believe It or Not Pride keeps a lot of people from obeying God uh in this area and listen the enemy he'll do whatever he can to stop you he'll he'll he if he can keep you from believing the wrong things about the Bible he'll do it if he can get your pride to get in the way he'll do whatever he can to stop you from taking that next step because he knows God blesses obedience he knows God's going to bless you just as he blessed Jesus when he got baptized and so Pride can get in the way he'll try to shame you and think that you're not worthy we're never worthy and we never will be worthy that's not a requirement for getting baptized some people I need to go clean my life up and get some things together guess what you'll always have something to clean up you'll always have something to get together that's not what baptism is it is symbolic it's a picture of letting people know you are saved and you are forgiven and and and you are his if you keep waiting till you get some stuff together you'll be waiting forever but that's not a prerequisite forgetting water baptized third reason people don't get baptized is they aren't followers of Jesus frankly there are a lot of people who consider themselves to be Christians and some who even go to church who have zero desire to learn the commands of God and certainly don't feel obligated to do them they see the Bible as a book of suggestions and so when it comes to a desire to be baptized there isn't any there's there's no statement to be made and it should always sound an alarm if we think we can follow God by choosing our own path it should always sound an alarm when we come to God but won't surrender our will and if you're here today and you've never given your life to Christ just know that he loves you we're so glad that you're here and we want you to know that accepting Jesus as your lord and savior it is the greatest thing you will ever do and when you do being baptized in water will be an amazing experience for you and for any that are here today and you've accepted Christ and not yet been baptized let me give you some great reasons why you should take the next critical important step the next critically important step let me give you some reasons you should be baptized number one make a statement to yourself listen after you raise your hand and pray the Prayer of Salvation the devil wants to come and he wants to snatch that seed he wants you to doubt your decision he wants you to make you he wants to make you think it was just an emotional response and when you take that next step of getting water baptized you're making a statement you're declaring no this was an emotional then listen I've decided to follow Jesus no turning back I'm making a statement to myself I am going all in with Jesus and I'm taking the next step I'm getting water baptized and after you get water baptized whatever that next step is I'm taking that next step and whatever the next step that is I'm Gonna Keep On stepping I'm making a statement to myself whatever God has for me I'm going to keep stepping into it step by step by step number two another reason it makes a statement to the world water baptism is a public Declaration of a personal decision I'm telling the world that I identify with the deaf burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ I want the world to know that I'm I am dead to my sin the old me is buried with him I'm a new Christian I want the whole world to know I'm a Child of God I'm forgiven I'm his I'm a kid of the king I want the whole world to know hey I'm still not perfect but I have Jesus I have a perfect Savior and I've given him my life and I am saved it's a so you see you make a statement to the world number three a third reason you should get baptized is your next step is always your most your most important one your next step is always your most important one if you you've never given your heart to the Lord that's your very first step that's your next step if you haven't given your heart to the Lord give your heart to the Lord but if you've done that you've given your heart to the Lord your next spiritual step is to be water baptized don't allow the enemy to keep you from moving forward into all that God has for you don't get stuck keep moving take the next step salvation is just the beginning of an exciting life and journey with Christ the next step is always the most important so if you haven't been water baptized that is your next step and it's the most important step if you have been water baptized your next step is to get in the growth track so that you can discover your purpose so that you can take your next step to get on the Dream Team and start serving others your next step is always the most important step and so we got to keep stepping everybody in this room no matter where you are in your faith Journey God has the next step for you you just keep stepping keep stepping the next step is always the most important number four fourth reason you should be baptized Jesus said you should isn't that a good reason if none of the other reasons have moved your heart this is really the only one that's needed we need to get baptized because that's the plan of God we see Jesus highlight its importance when giving the disciples the Great Commission look at Matthew 28 verse 19 through 20. he says therefore go and make disciples of all Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit Jesus said this is my plan You're Going To Go Make Disciples people don't give their heart and life to me and then you're going to baptize them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and then he says then you're going to teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I've given you and be sure of this I'm with you always even to the end of the age in the early church when people heard the gospel and wanted salvation they asked Peter what they needed to do Acts 2 38. Peter replied each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God that's the first step and the next step be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of your sins then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit God's plans and commands aren't optional if you want to follow him and experience His blessings James 4 17 remember it is a sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it if you know what you ought to do it do it by faith take the next step number five the fifth reason to get baptized is that God's blessing follows obedience I want you to know that anytime and every time you do what God tells you to do there's a blessing on the other side of your obedience look at Matthew chapter 3 verse 16 and 17. it says after his baptism remember Jesus said I I have to John was like whoa hold up no Jesus I know Jesus was like no no John I have to and it says after his baptism as Jesus came up out of the water the heavens were opened and he saw the spirit of God descending on on like a dove and settling on him and a voice from Heaven said this is my dearly loved Son who brings me great joy notice after he was baptized the Holy Spirit came and rested on him it's a picture of the blessing of God the presence of God the power of God coming to rest on Jesus and the father said I am pleased he demonstrated his pleasure then by sending the holy spirit in the form of a dove to rest on Jesus why did Jesus get baptized because Jesus lived to please the father it was the next step John 8 28-29 Jesus says I do nothing on my own but say only what the father taught me and the one who sent me is with me he has not deserted me for I always do what pleases him when you get baptized you can know you are pleasing the Lord after all he's done for you you can know without a doubt this pleases him and Jesus knew this was something he needed to do he was about to launch into his public Ministry but first things first he needed the blessing of the father he needed the strength and the anointing of the Holy Spirit he knew he would be tired and hungry and he'd be thirsty and weak and he knew that when he did what the father wanted him to do he would have the strength and the anointing to do what he needed to do it would later be it would later be recorded this way in the book of Acts Acts chapter 10 verse 36-38 it says this is the message of good news for the people of Israel that there is peace with God through Jesus Christ who is Lord of all you know what happened throughout Judea beginning in Galilee after John began began preaching his message of baptism and you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who oppressed by the devil for God was with him you know I've found in life we like to skip steps come on how are you like a good shortcut you know what I mean a shortcut how do I skip to the front of the line look little Cohen he don't quite get that yet he dead I'm cutting everybody I'm like boy get back here you're not cutting nobody we like to skip steps you know what I mean my daughter Cali she take the with the keys to the car in an instant dad I don't need to wait till I'm 16 she start driving that thing right around we just man if we could skip some steps if we could get ahead and Jesus is showing sewing to something so profound because if anybody could have skipped a step it was Jesus you know what I mean John was like what geez I don't need to baptize you come on man baptize me she said no no no need you to baptize me before I start my public Ministry he didn't skip a step see the blessed life is a faithful walk of obedience one step at a time your most important step is the next one and as you take it you will go from blessing to blessing James 1 25 it says but if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard then God will bless you for doing it God blesses obedience I got saved in 1999. and I got baptized in water it was about three months because again I didn't even know I didn't even understand but once they explained it to me I was like sign me up prior to that I had such a radical change in my life almost weekly every Sunday or every Wednesday night at youth group somebody was coming up to me they're saying you're gonna be a pastor and I'm like don't uh don't say that I don't want to be a pastor no you know what I mean that was I was not flattered no you know oh I'm just telling you I see some you're gonna be a pastor you're gonna be a man I'm like stop it I don't want to be in a Ministry I don't want to be a pastor okay I'm gonna go to IUPUI I'm gonna get my degree in education I'm gonna be a teacher in a high school maybe help coach and I'm gonna have season tickets to the Colts I gotta figure it out okay back up off me every week [Music] oh you gonna be a pastor oh no I'm not people trying to be God no I I do not I don't want to be a pastor I'm starting to get frustrated with people oh you're gonna be no I don't want to be I have zero desire and matter of fact right before I got baptized but it came up to me is it I said you're gonna be a pastor pass you backhand somebody before you get baptized yes she gets okay because again I already I'm saved but I'm not perfect I'm just letting people know that I got a relationship with the savior [Music] and so I get in the water and I remember just being baptized in the moment and just I can remember how the Wilder would look more I just remember all of it right and I remember going under the water and I remember coming up and coming out of that water that was the first time in my life where I felt like God spoke in such a clear inaudible voice to me and God said I want you to be a pastor [Music] I was shook I was like I think I got somebody else's message in the tub I thank God I think God wasn't looking at the baptism order correctly here and I get out of the water I'm tyling off and I'm just consumed with this thought you're going to be a pastor you're going to be a pastor and I'm like I'm just I'm processing it all and then this lady comes up to me she says you don't know me at all but I want you to know God told me you Gotta Be You Gotta Be careful with folks if you're telling you stuff like that right she said I want you know God told me he's going to use you in the ministry to impact many people's lives oh you know what I went home that night I still fought God God I don't want to be a pastor and the more I said the louder I said I don't want to be a pastor the louder God said you're going to be a pastor and I for whatever reason prior to getting baptized that was never revealed to be my God a lot of people were trying to say stuff and I had to figure it out I was going to be a high school teacher I was going to have season tickets to the Colts I was good but after I got baptized man I got the blessing of my calling and and when God said it that was it that was a done deal but you know what that day I didn't just get the blessing of my call to full-time Ministry but I also got the blessing of having family members at my baptism and friends that would never ever ever come to church but they came that day because I got baptized in that day they got to hear my testimony and that day they got to hear about Jesus I'm just telling you God blesses obedience okay He blesses obedience and now listen I'm not saying you're like so what if I get baptized I'll be called a full-time minutes I have no idea it's between you and God I don't know what blessing Waits on the other side of your baptism I just know there's a blessing because God blesses obedience there's a blessing on the side of whatever step it is some of you have already been baptized but you haven't taken the next step you haven't taken the next step to join the Dream Team or start serving you whatever that step is whatever step you have any time you take a step of obedience there is a blessing on the other side but we gotta take the step and I don't know what the blessing is but I know his word says his word says God will bless you for doing it so let me ask you are there any errors in your life you need to repent of because you know God is clearly told you to take a Next Step and you've clearly chosen not to today you can change all of that and take that step other steps of obedience you need to take maybe some of you today you're a Christian but you have not been water baptized and you're already trying to think of some excuses well I didn't bring a change of clothes and you know Pastor Chris I did just get my hair done and hey you know what we got you all covered we got hair Nets was not a net you know what I mean like it's the one hair cap I don't know what you call it again I ain't had hair in a long time y'all but you can put it on your hair your hair won't get wet we got draws see I don't know what draws all we got underwear brand new come on you get a brand new pair of underwear from people's church today we got undergarments we got shorts we got t-shirts we got towels we don't want and I don't want anybody in this room to miss the opportunity to take their next step matter of fact there was a man that got saved he said what do I need to do so you need to get baptized and they're like there's water right here they're like they baptized them right then and there hey we got water right here for your next service if that's your next step would you take it today and would you get baptized in water God blesses obedience
nasCjPoLtdM,well good morning People's Church uh we just want to say thank you we are we are missionaries that this church supports and we couldn't do what we do without the help of you um we had an amazing year at IUPUI a lot of students uh come to Jesus we baptized 13 students for first time at the end of the year this last year so just thank you um thank you so much so yes we're missionaries but this is also our home church if we're not traveling speaking somewhere this is where we are we love this place and it's a awesome church amen and we are launching this new series on reintroducing the Holy Spirit and so I want to open up with a story I want to tell you about a boy this is a boy that is from the east side of Indy right here you can see he's hardcore right that's a guy takes nothing off a nobody yeah right um well this East Side Indie boy left for a small Bible College in Springfield Missouri and there he met his college Crush and she's a Latina lover of Jesus Hallelujah there's only one problem she wasn't crushing on him and so they both graduated from college and uh they never dated and they started their individual lives seven years later through Facebook however listen if it would have been just a couple years sooner how many of you know it would have been Myspace right come on how many of you remember my space right people were sliding into Myspace Pages there was no DMS there was just my space right some of you flirted through my space you were like hey girl you want to see this face you need to log into Myspace and if you pray for his grace then he'll give you the wisdom to know you should be my mate right that's that's that's the kind of flow I had right there um but seven years later through Facebook by Fate the two of these people reignited a friendship and by Fate I mean the Lord hallelujah and he brought us back uh together so those two they dated for a while long distance her in Missouri me and Indiana and we called and we Skyped each other until one day she decided to say yes after I proposed and um several months later after that the two of them got married where she realized he was the funniest person she had ever met I mean literally she's doubled over people that's how funny I am just want you to know that's what she thinks and how's it going you ask well he's still making her laugh and honored to be her husband so leading up to us getting engaged we both had a lot of questions right a lot of questions we asked them all so that we could get to know each other how many of you remember that phase of the relationship the really long maybe late night telephone calls right if you come from my generation the landline telephone calls with the 50-foot long cord how many of you remember those phones you hang it up and that Core Go spiral up right away you'd stretch it out slide it under slide that cord underneath your door so you could be in a different room with the door shut and you're on later nine you're like are you hang up no no no no no you hang up you want to know who always hung up first the other person you want to know why because I fell asleep every time I'm a morning person I don't do these late night phone calls you start hitting like midnight I'm a and they're like are you are you there are you seriously sleeping right now and then you wake up and then they're mad at you and you're like what happened like you fell asleep on me like well it was midnight let's be a fair okay um but those late night phone calls you're learning about each other you want to know what each other are like and there's this season where you have so many questions where you want to learn right and so I use that story because I think our relationship with the Holy Spirit is kind of similar and the fact that we have to take time to get to know the Holy Spirit we're going to ask questions we got to learn right so let me show you what I mean the Bible says something interesting as Paul was meeting with some Believers and he wanted them to know the holy spirit in Acts 19 verse 2. it says did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed they answered no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit see these early followers of Jesus had never even heard of the Holy Spirit they didn't know about the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Spirit and for some of you here this morning you may be just finding out that there even is a holy spirit for some you have heard about the Holy Spirit and you're just beginning to know the Holy Spirit and for others if you're like me you've known the holy spirit for years and you still need to know more because we'll never exhaust everything we can understand about the Holy Spirit or about Jesus or about God listen if you understand everything there is to know about God then then you must be him you with me this morning he's bigger than you you understand that right we can't just fit God in a nice tidy box and say all this makes sense he's always going to blow our mind if you let him and so the holy spirit is the same way and let me tell you this after being married to Danny for almost 13 years we're still getting to know each other truthfully I will never stop learning about my wife because the day I believe there's nothing left to learn is the day that our relationship stops to flourish like it just doesn't do it doesn't grow anymore because like I just know everything there is to know and I don't I'm always learning we don't want our relationship to become dry and stale so there's always learning involved and leaning in and learning about my wife requires both effort and intentionality lots of conversations lots of questions knowing her desires knowing what she is thinking and knowing her dreams and it's the same way with the Holy Spirit no matter how long you have been a Christ follower you cannot lose your desire to get to know the Holy Spirit more and more and let me tell you there's so much more to know so let me show you this in a couple scriptures First Corinthians chapter 2 verses 9 through 12. however as it is written what no I has seen what no ear has heard and what no human mind has conceived the things God has prepared for those who love him these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit everyone say spirit the spirit searches all things even the Deep things of God for who knows a person's thoughts except their own Spirit within them in the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the spirit of God what we have received is not the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from God so that we may understand what God has freely given us in Romans 11 verse 33 oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and untraceable his ways in these two passages we learned that we will never be able to search out all the depths of God there's always so much more to learn and discover but in order to help us start this journey in discovering more about the Holy Spirit I want to walk you through five questions if you're taking notes five questions about the Holy Spirit now I'm going to give this as a caveat I am going to use a lot a lot of scripture all right so if you're someone who's like I want to turn you your hands are going to be on fire this morning okay um so if you are afraid you're going to fall behind everything's going to be on the screen but the reason why we do that is because I want you to know that these things I'm saying about the Holy Spirit I want you to know this is not just my opinion or things I'm just throwing out randomly I want to show you in the Bible so you can have a foundation where this stuff comes from amen so whether you have grown up in church or just checking out the church you've probably heard things that you thought were weird about the holy spirit so the first question we want to cover is what is the Holy Spirit because the truth is we've heard all kinds of things especially if you've grown up in church so you say the Holy Spirit he's a dove and if you grew up in the 90s or early 2000s in in Christian circles at all and you ever saw a Christian drama that's how they always portray him right you even see people do like Happy Hands Club stuff they're up there and they're like and then if you have more rhythm you're more like you know but host bear he's a dove right he's he's like water um so if you grew up in the church I grew up in we have brother Curtis he come in and preach all the time he's like the Holy Ghost actually say like this he said Holy Ghost like that get this that right there I don't know what that is why we do that right basically Holy Ghost he's like a he's like what was that word he said fire is is that what we're saying fire just making sure he's fire he's the Holy Ghost right if you grew up like I did it was a lot of questions but seriously what is the holy spirit the simply the simplest answer is this the holy spirit is God the Bible teaches us that there is one God who exists in three distinct persons God the Father God the son and God the holy spirit in Acts 5 verses 3 through 4 then Peter said ananias how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and if kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land didn't it belonged to you before it was sold and after it was sold wasn't the money at your disposal what made you think of doing such a thing you have not lied just to human beings but to God everyone say God see at first ananias it says that he lied to the Holy Spirit but then he says he lies to God this is not a contradiction because the holy spirit is God let me say it this way the father is God Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is God and they are all one and yet three distinct persons this is what we call the doctrine of the trinity let me show you their distinctness and togetherness in a few passages let me zero in on their distinctness first Acts chapter 10 verse 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power and how he went around doing good and healing all who are under the power of the devil because God was with him and this passage you see God the Father anointing Jesus the son with the Holy Spirit we see all three distinct persons Matthew 3 16-17 as soon as Jesus was baptized he went up out of the water at that moment heaven was opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove notice he didn't say the spirit was descending and he is a dove he says he's like a dove so he doesn't have to be a bird for everybody okay um so he descended like a dove and a lighting on him and a voice from Heaven said this is my son whom I love with him I am well pleased this is another example of their distinctness but they're also one they are one in three and three and one and let me show you this John 10 30. I am the father R1 John 17 11. I will remain in the world no longer but they are still in the world and I am coming to you Holy Father protect them by the power of your name the name you gave me so that they might be one as we are one Jesus's prayer is that although we are different people that we would become one Spirit just like the father and son are one and just how perfect was their Union let's look at some more verses John 5 19. Jesus gave them this answer very truly I tell you the son can do nothing by himself he can do only what he sees his father doing because whatever the father does the son also does they are the perfect union three distinct persons but they are one one example we see of this in scripture is how Jesus only does what he sees his father doing John 14 10-11 don't you believe that I am in the father and that the father is in me the words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority rather it is the father living in me who is doing his work believe me when I say that I am in the father and the father is in me or at least believe on the evidence of The Works themselves we see that the father and son are one so the son only does what the father tells him to do but the holy spirit is also one with the father and the son John 16 verses 13 through 15 but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is Yet to Come he will glorify me because it is for me that he will receive what he will make known to you verse 15. all that belongs to the father is mine that is why I said the spirit will receive from me well he will make known to you I hope you're starting to see this church that there's one God who exists in three persons it's hard to wrap our minds around this mysterious biblical truth because the truth is it is bigger than us to make complete sense out of it honestly some of the best metaphors I've ever maybe come across is like maybe this relationship is kind of like water and the fact that water although it's always H2O it can manifest itself as a solid a liquid or a gas right you can you can have ice you can have the liquid form of water you can boil it and then you see Steam but the outward function or appearance although it might change water itself is not changed it is H2O and and although that might be a good metaphor I think understanding the Trinity is even way beyond that I think there's a chance the Lord hears us trying our best to explain what he's like and he's like oh you're cute you know like you ever have your kids explain something or they try and make sense of something that you know they don't fully understand but when they're explaining it you're not mad because they got it wrong you're like that you're adorable right I think sometimes God has those moments when we're trying to explain him he's like you're adorable I love you you know but the truth is it's really big and it's fully complex and hard to wrap our minds around but here's the point I want you to catch there's one God made up of three distinct beings the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and they all possess the same essence or the same divine nature they have the same attributes and Perfections no one is less than the other they're all the same and they're all just alike they're all in agreement they're in Perfect Harmony the description of one belongs to the others they are all God three in one and one in three which means the holy spirit is God but the holy spirit is also a person the holy spirit is not in it is not a thing the holy spirit is a person and scripture uses personal pronouns when talking about them for example in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 11 all these are the work of one and the same spirit and he distributes them to each one just as he determines Hebrews 3 7 so as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice scripture teaches that the holy spirit is a person it's not a thing he's not an it he's a person and so then that leads us to our second question and that is this what makes the Holy Spirit a person by a person we mean one who has their own Identity or individuality as a rational being a person is one who's conscious of their own existence when the Bible says that he's a person it's not saying that the Holy Spirit has eyes and feet and hands it's just saying that that he is per like a person in the fact that he's conscious and he has an existence and he has a will and there's all these things and he's personal and so I want to show you why the Bible calls God the Holy Spirit a person number one he is alive Romans 8 verse 2 and because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death and for all of us that are Christians we say Amen he gave us power to defeat sin that was leading us towards death number two he has a mind Romans 8 27 and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God just like you have a mind just like you have thoughts so does the Holy Spirit but you have to get to know the Holy Spirit more so you can know his mind it's not just something we just tap into Jesus even says it this way in our relationship with him he says the Sheep know my voice but how many of you know the only way you can know his voice is by spending time with him so you recognize the voice of the shepherd right you're not going to know his voice if you're not working on the relationship and getting deeper in understanding and knowledge you have to know him more and more it's like my relationship with Danny if I want to know what's going on in her mind I have to get to know her to that level she doesn't think like me we are not the same person I'll give you a prime example maybe and this is for a lot of marriages maybe one of the greatest tensions on Sunday morning is getting to church on time how many of you say Amen how many of you know that and most couples there's one who's really punctual and there's one who is not okay I'm not gonna say which one is which actually I am I'm the one who loves to be on time okay and to a point where it's probably something I need to work on because I literally start to get worked up and nerved up if I can tell we're going to be late and so what we've discovered though especially coming here is we have different definitions of what on time is see on time for her means that when we show up to the 11 o'clock service we're pulling into the parking lot at 11 o'clock and I'm like no no no no that's not on time she's like what do you mean I'm like well we have to get out of the car then we have to walk to the front doors and listen I'm an extrovert okay I have the opposite of social anxiety I have social excitement okay whenever we come to church I'm like I want to be there early enough so that I can actually talk to the greeter I don't want to just shake their head I'm like how are you what's your story let's camp out for a while you know like I want to know people I'm excited I love the people moment I have introverted friends that call this place their home and they think about coming to church after the people moment so they don't have to meet anybody they're like I'm terrified I'm like terrified I might turn around and make a new best friend today that's how I'm thinking right so I'm like no no we got to get to church early enough that we can get into there I can talk to the greeter we can check in the kids get them in and talk to a few people and then still hear the first note of the worship song that's on time anybody with me this morning okay how many other people by show hands are like my wife we're going to show up when service starts that's on time okay there's some of you that are honest and a lot of liars in this room okay just being honest we're going to keep it real this morning so the Holy Spirit has a mind but he also has a will First Corinthians 12 11 all these are empowered by one in the same Spirit who apportions to each one individually as he Wills the Holy Spirit has a will this is important to understand because there's so many people that do what they want to do and then slap the holy spirit's name on it right and listen let me say you got to be careful throw in the God card on things that you want as a matter of fact there's a lot of biblical evidence to say that's what it means to take the lord's name in vain it's not using God's name as a cuss word it's saying God said when God didn't say because it's what you want and you don't want anyone to question it so we'll just slap God on it right but the Holy Spirit has a will and he wants to accomplish it in your life and on this Earth he also has emotions Romans 15 30. I urge you brothers and sisters by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the spirit to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me the holy spirit is loving Galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace forbearance kindness goodness faithfulness the holy spirit is joyful and peaceful he has emotions he can even be grieved we see this in Ephesians 4 30 and do not grieve the holy spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption you have to learn what Grieves the Holy Spirit and you can only know that by knowing what Grieves him the holy spirit is a person that hurts even when you lie to him acts 5 3 then Peter said ananias how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you receive for the land so this is important stuff to understand because a relationship is built on trust and for you to have a successful relationship with the Holy Spirit you can't lie to them and how many of you know you can't really lie to God anyway because he knows everything so you might as well just be honest it's not like he doesn't know right so be honest and have an open and and very foundational relationship built on trust with the Holy Spirit another thing the Holy Spirit has a personality he has unique and identifiable characteristics when I got to know my wife I began to discover her unique qualities and attributes she has her own unique personality our four kids all have their own unique qualities and personalities and my relationship with all of them is not a one-size-fits all it's Unique and tailored towards each individual child my my uh my youngest my baby girl JoJo she is she's a Spitfire and so my relationship with her looks different than Gavin my son who's a little bit more in tune with his emotions and so I have to be in relationship with them uniquely and differently and it's important to understand that when the Holy Spirit is in your life your relationship with him might look a little bit different because he has his own unique qualities so we've answered what is the Holy Spirit and what makes the Holy Spirit a person but our next question is where did the Holy Spirit come from and when you want to get to know someone learning their history is very very important one of the first things I learned about my wife Danny was that she was the daughter of a Mexican father and a white mother who grew up in a very small town in the Ozarks of Missouri as I was getting to know her I was learning her history and how all of her history creates how she's become and who she's turned into the holy spirit's history is interesting though because he has no beginning and that may be hard to grasp so that is why Isaiah says this Isaiah 40 28 do you not know have you not heard the Lord is the Everlasting God the creator of the heavens of the earth he will not grow tired or weary and is understanding no one can fathom Revelation 1 8 I am the Alpha and the Omega says the Lord God who was and who was who is and who was and who is to come the Almighty Hebrews 9 14 just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our Consciousness from sinful Deeds so that we can worship the Living God for by the power of the eternal spirit Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins the Bible teaches this that the godhead the holy spirit is included in that right is eternal he's always been and always will be and I know that's hard for us because every one of us has a beginning and we'll all have an end but they don't they just always were and they always will be and that should on some level be like I mean it should be like how is that possible and for me that's what makes God so amazing that he's that big right that he can just blow my mind and so the Bible teaches us the holy spirit is eternal he's always been he always will be his No Beginning No End matter of fact he was present and part of the creation of the world the heavens and earth and Humanity Genesis 1 2 now the Earth was formless and empty Darkness was over the surface of the deep and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters the Holy Spirit was a part of creation because he is God he has no beginning or end he's Eternal Everlasting Alpha and Omega and not only does he not have an origin but he also does not have a single residence because the holy spirit is everywhere David said it this way in Psalm 139 7 I can never escape from your spirit I can never get away from your presence Psalm 139 78 where can I go from your spirit the answer to that question isn't implied nowhere because he's everywhere and that shouldn't freak you out the holy spirit is not like a stalker like with you everywhere just waiting for you to mess up right the second you make a mistake ah gotcha like that's not what he's like it should be a comfort because that means anything you've ever walked through no matter how painful or traumatic he's there and the reason why that's good news is because one of the descriptions of the holy spirit is that he's a comforter he is that presence of God that lies within you that is there to comfort you when you go through difficult times and I'm thankful for that aspect of him because how many of you know if you live life long enough you will go through some tough things when I was growing up in church they used to teach that you know if you just if you cling to Jesus and you live a good life like you're going to avoid a lot of bad things and I clung to Jesus and I loved him with all my heart and I suffered a lot of things and I'm not mad at God for it I actually don't think God caused any of it but what I am thankful for is that God was present with me through his Spirit when I needed all of the healing when I needed the power to walk through therapy to get healing in these things in my life the holy spirit is encouraging me and plotting me on because he wants to heal what's in my heart amen and he wants that for you as well but he's everywhere and by now you're probably starting to wrap your minds around some of what the holy spirit is but what does the Holy Spirit do that's our fourth question this is an important question when you're getting to know someone and that's what Danny and I would ask each other what do you do where do you work what do you do for fun what do you want to do with your future to really get to know the Holy Spirit you need to ask what does the Holy Spirit do that is different from the father and the son now remember although they're three in one they also have distinct roles and so first I want to show you this the father created The Plan of Salvation John 6 37-38 all those the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me I will never drive away for I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me Jesus the son he executed The Plan of Salvation Galatians 4 4 but when the set time had fully come God sent his son born of a woman born under the law the father had a plan he wanted executed to save Humanity from their sin and Jesus accomplished the father's plan in Luke 22 42 father if you are willing take this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done Jesus dies on the cross he rose again on the third day and Jesus is part of Salvation was to take on our sins through his death and on the cross and then he defeated death Hell In The Grave by Rising again and Jesus has done all he's going to do to save us from our sins I want to show you this Hebrews 7 27 unlike those other high priests he does not need to offer sacrifices every day they did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people but Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as a sacrifice for the people's sins although Jesus is sitting at the right hand of his father praying for us he has done everything he needed to do to reconcile us to the father that is why when he says it is finished it truly is listen here's the good news why that why this is good news for you today Jesus isn't going to do anything else to make you more Christian he died on the cross he rose from the dead he's already the Victor he's already the king you just have to embrace your new identity in Christ to live the way he wants you to live [Music] and so when you mess up and you sin and you wake up and you feel all this condemnation like what's wrong with you why would you do that understand that's not the voice of your father in Heaven that's the voice of the devil but remind the devil you've already been defeated you don't have a right to my mind because Jesus is transforming me by the renewing of my mind I will speak what's true of me I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I am already bought with a price I am already saved I am already walking in his grace and you can't take that away from me [Music] I used to love when people say when the devil reminds you of his past remind him of his future he's a defeated foe Jesus has won the battle he's done everything he needs to do so the father creates The Plan of Salvation Jesus executes The Plan of Salvation but the holy spirit is carrying out the Plan of Salvation John 16 7-9 but in fact it is best for you that I go away because if I don't The Advocate won't come this is the holy spirit he's talking about if I do go away then I will send him to you and when he comes he will convict the world of its sin and of God's righteousness and of the coming judgment the world's sin is that it refuses to believe in me the holy spirit is the one on the earth working today he's carrying out the plan of the father and building upon the execution of the son which leads us to our last question what does the Holy Spirit do in the life the Christ follower this is where it gets down to you and I right here in this space what does he do in the life of a Christ follower and with that question comes a whole other set of questions for example what does the Holy Spirit do in my life how do I get to know him better what will happen in my life when I do get to know him better does the Holy Spirit speak to me personally for some of you like I've heard this thing called speaking in tongues what is that I've heard about the fruit of the spirit how do I get that Josh you talked about grieving the Holy Spirit am I doing that am I following his will what does the Holy Spirit want to do in my life Josh I need some answers about the Holy Spirit and how to get to know him better what we're going to do is through the remaining weeks of this series we're going to help you understand and wrap your mind around him more and more and more and hopefully answer a lot of these questions for you [Music] I if I could just tell you this close with this I want you to know the Holy Spirit I would say of all the parts of the Trinity he's the one that's most often forgotten or overlooked we know God [Music] and we know Jesus but this member of the family called the Trinity the Holy Spirit a lot of us are like and what I hope happens through this series is that you don't neglect him but you allow him to have space to work in and through your life because let me tell you I have been walking with the Holy Spirit for a long time and he is vital like I can't live the Christian Life without his help can't oh man without the spirit I may have prayed a prayer and said Jesus Come into my heart but without the spirit's help I'm still someone who wants to try and impress everyone I'm still someone who would rather lie if it makes me look bad then tell the truth I'm someone who has all kinds of things going on internally that I don't know how to understand and I don't know how it affects other people but the Holy Spirit when they give him space he starts to convict those things in my life and I want you to understand conviction is not condemnation condemnation is saying you're worthless conviction is saying you're better there's a big difference between me looking at my son and saying you screwed up what's wrong with you verses that's not who you were created to be there's more in you and I'm excited to see it so the Holy Spirit comes in and he says hey son reminds me of my identity hey son you're better than your acting there's more for you that's what I want but he's vital you need a relationship with him
QTESE8_O5rQ,well today we are continuing our series I wish I would have and the title of my message today is I wish I would have made a comeback I wish I would have made a comeback I Googled what is the largest comeback victory in NFL history and I discovered it happened a few months ago and involved my beloved Indianapolis Colts unfortunately they were not the team that made the comeback if you remember watching that game the Colts were playing the Minnesota Vikings the game was in Minnesota and it looked like just the Colts were Unstoppable matter of fact at halftime the Colts were winning 33 to zero announcers shared how hundreds of viking fans at halftime left the stadium so you know they're not true fans hundreds left and in the third quarter Colts are up 33-0 and then I'm going to show you what happened warning if you are a Colts fan like I am this footage may be painful check out what happened cousins play action for cousins looking at Zone open oh that's not good spring with Alvin cook and let him chew up the yards um cousins because it's first down Osborne Jose has been a superstar potential field goal attempt cousins North and the kick it's good oh to my Colts fans painful painful painful but man the Minnesota Vikings came back had the greatest comeback and and down 33 to zero what a comeback you know we've all experienced setbacks in all the Colts fans can now say Amen next year I'm hoping my message will be a little different the Colts will be making a comeback but we've all experienced setbacks in life we have felt like we were down 33 to zero down 33-0 with our your family down 33-0 with your marriage in a friendship down 33-0 in your finances 33-0 in your health down 33-0 in your career we've all been downed 33 to zero and in the middle of a setback we can feel like those Minnesota Vikings fans felt at halftime I'm done I quit I'm leaving there is absolutely no chance no hope we might as well give up because there's no way a comeback could happen but no matter how severe the setback you can make a comeback even if you are down 33 to zero you can experience the greatest comeback because we serve the god of the comeback he specializes in come back David came back from adultery and murdered and was called a man after God's Own Heart and led Israel as king Elijah went from the height of Victory to the depths of depression but he made a comeback and God used him powerfully Samson disobeyed God lost his strength was captured was a prisoner was ridiculed and mocked but he called out to God and he made a comeback and defeated his enemies Moses murdered a man ran away from his purpose struggled with fear but he answered the call again and made a comeback to lead the nation of Israel out of slavery in Egypt and Jesus he hung he bled he died on a cross and he was put in a borrowed grave but we know three days later he had the largest comeback in history when he rose from that grave he defeated death hell and the grave come on would you give God praise and thank him he's a god of the comeback he's a god of the comeback and today we're going to look at the comeback story of Peter if you're not familiar with this story he denied Jesus three times as Jesus was arrested beaten dying on the cross Peter blew it big time and I want to First share some insights that led to Peter's setback the first thing I want you to see is this is that he relied on his own strength listen to what Jesus told Peter in Matthew chapter 26 verse 31. it says then Jesus told them this very night you will all fall away on account of me for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered look at Peter's response in Matthew 26 33 Peter replied even if all fall away on account of you I never will come on Peter was puffing up his chest he was pretty confident in his own strength they may all Jesus but Jesus I never will listen to what he says in Matthew 26 35 but Peter declared even if I have to die with you I will never disown you and all the other disciples said the same Peter said I I I will never I'll never do that I'm with you and I'll stick with you and he's just talking about himself he is relying on his own strength he's leaning on his own strength and regret is always right around the corner when we lean on our own strength regret is always around the corner when we're like I got this I'm the only one I'll do that but I I when we rely on our own strength notice what happens next number two he reacted without thinking Matthew chapter 26 verse 69 and 70. it says now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him you also were with Jesus of Galilee she said but he denied it before them all I don't know what you're talking about he said Peter was relying on his own strength and In the Heat of the Moment he reacted and denied Jesus so many regrets happen because we reacted we reacted and said something hurtful we reacted and did something we regret we reacted and we we reacted and we lied we reacted and had the fling we reacted and did the drug we reacted and we bought the item at 30 percent interest with money that we don't even have reacting without thinking leads to regret then thirdly he caved to the crowd you can read it yourself but in Matthew 26 72 and 74 Peter denied Jesus two more times to the crowd so much regret is centered around caving into people trying to fit in trying to please people trying to be liked or loved trying to make people happy so many students do stupid things they regret because they cave to the crowd come on even adults do stupid things because they cave to the crowd they cave to culture they caved to relationships or a friendship and then comes regret he caved to the crowd and then fourthly he went backwards instead of forwards when we pick up the story of Peter several days after his setback he had went back to his old life and career look at John 21 verse 3 he says I'm going out to fish Simon Peter told him and they said we'll go with you so they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing Peter went back to fishing he went back to his old life he went back to what was familiar he went back to the very thing that God called him from and called him out of Jesus said come and follow me I'll teach you how to fish for men and Peter followed him but then he had a setback and he went back to the very old thing that God called him away from and some of you you have allowed regret to take you back to Old Friends old thinking old relationships old bad habits you've allowed regret to take you back to some old things that God had called you out of and said no that's not my plan that's not my purpose but regret has caused you to go back to those old relationships to those old thought patterns see regret can either suck the life out of you and take you backwards or you can allow it to be the fuel that drives you forward to a comeback I want want you to begin to use regret as fuel for your comeback feel for your comeback and so today I want to give you three catalysts to a comeback three catalysts to a comeback number one is this choose to reflect over regret choose to reflect over regret the difference between reflecting and regretting is that when you regret you look back and you focus on the losses when you reflect you look back for lessons let me say that again when you regret you look back and you're just focused on losses but when you reflect you look back at the lessons learning the lessons leads to Blessings just snap that right or have whatever you want to do with it but learning the lessons leads to Blessings staying stuck on the losses only costs us and so let me teach you some effective ways to reflect first a part of reflecting is grieving a part of ref reflecting is grieving look at Matthew 26 75 it says then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken before the rooster crows you will disown me three times and the Bible says he went outside and wept bitterly Peter grieved his mistakes as you choose to reflect on your past regrets it's necessary to embrace what you lost it's okay listen be honest with yourself about the mistake the pain who you lost and what you lost grieving is a part of reflecting and to get past your past you have to face your past and part of that is you got to confess It and Weep over it see grief is the way you get through the laws the transition and failure in life you can't go around it you have to go through it but you gotta go through it and not live in it let me say that again with grief listen you can't go around it you have to go through it but you have to go through it not live in it see reflecting is how you learn from it grieve and learn don't grieve and repeat grieve and learn don't grieve and repeat you can't come back if you keep repeating it I see I like well I don't know what was like but but I will do it I will revisit what I did what I said situations mistakes leadership decisions and learn from them most people never learn from regret and so they repeat and they stay in defeat learn and grow don't repeat and stay in defeat we could we I'm rhyming this morning learn and grow and don't repeat and stay in defeat and so as you reflect got to reflect grieving is part of reflecting let me give you the second Catalyst and that's this choose community over isolation choose community over isolation in this story both Judas and Peter made mistakes and were full of regret Judas betrayed Jesus Peter said I'll never disown you and then just own him three times the difference is Judas went off by himself got alone in his thoughts and took his life but Peter went back to his brothers a big part of his comeback was he chose community over isolation Easter morning the the disciples they were all together look at John 22 and 3. we see that after Jesus's death Peter is with his brothers it says so she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple the one Jesus loved and said they have taken the Lord out of the Tomb and we don't know where they have put him so Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb Peter blew it big time and he was full of regret but he ran to community rather than to isolation a catalyst to your comeback is you got a to go inward to run away from people when you go through a major failure loss setback you have to resist the urge to isolate and insulate yourself resist the temptation to process all by yourself see the enemy scheme is he wants to get you all by yourself just like Judas and nothing good comes from staying all by yourself when you're experiencing a setback and so don't believe the lie don't buy into the LIE of the enemy too many people they allow condemnation and guilt and the grief to cause them to go into isolation no no no listen too many people think well what are people going to think about me I'm sure Peter who's probably embarrassed and like man in front of all those dudes I said I'll never disown you I'll die with you and then I denied him but I thank God that Peter swallowed his pride and he went back to his brothers his brothers hey Miss okay we've blown it too we've messed up too come on we're going to stay together we're gonna do this thing together we're with you listen you God you have people in your life and if you don't get in a small group get connected find there are people in your life they're not going to beat you up they're going to pick you up people in your life that are going to be humble enough to say man I've blown it too and I've messed up too but I'm with you and I'm beside you choose community over over isolation number three choose the voice of Jesus over the voice of the enemy when you have a setback the enemy the accuser the liar will tell you it's over you'll never come back from what happened the enemy's whispering in your ear you are down 33 to zero in life it's over give up quit throw in the towel you are finished but let me tell you what Jesus says to you after your setback you said it to Peter and he's saying it to you here's the first thing that Jesus is saying to you he's saying I am not shocked by your setback Jesus told Jesus told Peter he was going to deny him Peter you are going to make some big mistakes I'm not shocked I'm not surprised by your mistakes Peter I know you're going to mess up even before you mess up hear me today God's not surprised by your failure your mistakes and your setbacks and he still loves you he didn't dismiss Peter he didn't say Peter get away from me he still loved him and cared for him and did life with him Jesus said I am not shocked by your setback secondly he's saying I am praying for you look at Luke chapter 22 verse 31 and 32 Simon Simon Satan has asked to sift all of you as we but I have prayed for you Simon that your faith may not fail and when you have turned back strengthen your brothers Before Peter ever made his big mistake Jesus said Not only am I not shocked by it but I'm praying for you before during and after the mistake Jesus knows one of the devil's greatest weapons is to kick you when you're down is to take your failure and rub it in your face it's to sift you as wheat to kill kill steal and destroy you and Jesus said I know the enemy's plans and I'm praying that your failure will not destroy your faith right now Jesus is praying for you right now Jesus is interceding for you he is standing in the gap between your failure and your faith he says I'm praying for you and then the third thing he says to you is I still believe in you and your comeback I still believe in you and your comeback Before Peter ever failed Jesus prophesied his setback but he also prophesied his comeback look back at Luke 22 32 it says but I have prayed for you Simon that your faith may not fail and when you have turned back strengthen your brothers Jesus said when you turn back when you make your comeback not if but when Jesus said I know you're going to have a setback but I also know you are going to make a comeback I believe in you I've seen you I made you I created you don't let your setbacks disqualify you from a comeback come on somebody needs to hear this today your setback is just a chapter in your book it's not the entire story it's just a chapter it's just a comma not a period and Jesus is the author of your story Jesus is the wind with the the holds the pen to your story and he has more of your story to write so get back up and move forward look at Proverbs 24 16. it says for though the righteous falls seven times they Rise Again everybody say rise again come on Rise Again get back up don't stay down get up listen Peter got back up move forward word and preached the first message on the day of Pentecost and 3 000 people were saved that day he made a comeback God continued to use Peter mightily to build his church and just like Peter God has more for your life but you have to get up stop allowing regret to keep you from what God has next in your life stop allowing your past defeats to rob you of your future victories listen I got this this basketball here all right and come on I can dribble with my right hand if I did my left we might be in trouble but the beautiful thing about a basketball is a basketball was created to bounce back it was created to bounce and to bounce back into my hand and so the creator of the basketball when he made this basketball he made it out of material so that the basketball would bounce up it would bounce back and I need you to know today that God created you with material to bounce back that you may feel that you're down 33-0 in your marriage and life in relationships but God he made you with material to bounce back to have a comeback your finances can bounce back your worship can bounce back your prayer your your marriage whatever it is in your life come on he created you to bounce back would you stand to your feet come on could you stand ing the god of the comeback he's got a comeback for you he created you and made you a material to bounce back

somebody or maybe you had somebody say that to you but it's also a phrase found in the bible last week we looked at in in samuel king or not king but david little shepherd boy came to bring his brother some food as they're getting ready to fight goliath and they're actually not getting ready they've been stuck for 40 days they're afraid of goliath and david comes on the scene he's like what are you all afraid of like i'll go fight him right now and king david was like hold up hold up hold up don't be ridiculous david you are just a boy he is a man he is a soldier he's been trained for this for life don't be ridiculous and if you know the rest of the story david did not let that hinder him david had ridiculous faith he said no no no no i serve a big god i will go defeat goliath and king saul said all right go ahead and god did a miraculous a ridiculous work through david's life as he defeated that giant he had ridiculous faith that's actually the title of my message today is ridiculous faith if you know me at all uh you know that i love starbucks i probably get it daily it's rare that i miss a day but i i love starbucks and uh one day i was a gentleman that i've become friends with probably in the last four or five years or something i don't even remember why it came up we were getting lunch together and somehow it came up he asked me what my favorite drink was at starbucks and it's very easy i get the same thing every time i go to starbucks i get a grande iced coffee not the cold brew i don't like the cold brew grande iced coffee no classic sweet and low and cream you like pasta crisps even in the winter time yes in the wintertime i don't like hot coffee i think hot coffee is gross i do not like it so yes when it's 20 below 12 inches of snow outside a brother's got a iced coffee with no classic sweet and low and cream okay that's my that's my drink and so i shared that with him and i i can't remember why he had whatever what the conversation went didn't even think twice about it well a few weeks later we were meeting up again we were meeting in the morning and he said he showed me a text right before me he's like hey man i got something for you i'm like okay what pulled out and he had starbucks he said man you need to get your starbucks today i got you man i got your favorite drink and i'm looking and i'm like where is it because all i saw in his hand was the you know the white cup the the or the christmas the christmas cup now i saw the cup for the hot coffee i'm like no that's not the so i thought maybe he had it in the car and he's like man look i got it for just the way you like it hot coffee with no classic sweet and low and cream and he was so excited like man i got you i hooked you up yo i did not have the heart to tell him i said man you are so awesome man give me that cup and i think i fake sipped that thing for about a whole hour you know what i mean just put it to the lips but nothing went in my mouth and i just couldn't tell him like man he thought he had hit the nail on have you ever had to hear somebody they're like oh man wait till you see what i got you and you see it and you're like oh i hope that's not what you're talking about you know you're like oh you shouldn't have really you shouldn't have you know what i mean like come on anybody ever be like oh thank you so much and the next day you're returning that thing you know what i mean looking to get something you like a little bit better where somebody thought man they were pleasing you it was going to make you so happy but they missed the mark and there are some people that think they are pleasing god and they want to please god but they're not look what hebrews 11 6 says it says and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those that earnestly seek him it is impossible to please god without faith that's that's strong y'all like think about it you can come to church and not please god if you don't come in faith you can read your bible and not please god if you don't read your bible in faith you can tithe given a miracle offering or give to dream builders and not please god if you don't give in faith you can pray and not please god if you don't pray in faith the only way to please god is to live by faith look what james 1 6 says it says but ask in faith never doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind if you're going to please god you have to ask in faith give in faith worship in faith pray in faith live by faith matthew 21 21 jesus replied truly i tell you if you have faith and do not doubt listen god wants you to have faith and to not doubt he wants you to have big faith in a big god jesus says not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done people who live by faith don't just talk about the mountain they talk to the mountain mountain be gone in jesus name and so let me ask you do you have faith that pleases god or do you have a faulty faith you think it's working but it's not it's like that charger cord plugged it into the outlet plugged it into your phone went to sleep woke up your phone is dead like what it's a faulty cord you thought it was working but but it wasn't or do you have a fresh faith well let me explain a fresh faith romans 12 3 says each one of you is given a measure of faith so if you're a christian god has given you a measure of faith but the question is is your measure of faith growing bigger or smaller see many people have a measure of faith but they don't know how to use the fake that god has given them their faith is not growing it's not being elevated in fact for some it may be shrinking it's like they get a new electronic and it has all these features but they have no idea how to use it or maybe you have a fake faith see some people talk big faith but they don't but they don't live big faith it's like somebody's like oh i'm a hooper oh i got game oh i got game you're like all right man come and come out to the gym i'll get you on my team and they show up they got the jordans on come on they got the shorts and the in the tank top they got the compressor the compressor paint you know what i mean they got the they got the sleeve got the headband oh and they they ready you like oh yeah we got to do something you passing the ball brick brick they just building a house of bricks like oh man talking about you got game you you can't shoot a lick but they're dressed all up oh they look like they got game but oh no they do not have game or maybe you have a fading faith some of you used to live by faith but maybe things have happened maybe life has taken some hits gotten distracted and your faith is fading no longer living you stopped living by faith see what god wants you and i to have is a flourishing faith a flourishing faith is growing it's thriving it's active it is a moving forward faith james 2 17. it says in the same way faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action everybody say action faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead flourishing faith it is a forward moving faith it is always accompanied by action is your face is your faith accompanied by action or do you have a dead faith faulty faith a fresh faith fake faith or a fading faith listen god wants you to have a flourishing faith he wants you to have a faith that is moving forward it is taking action every day every month and every year a moving forward faith let me show you today what a moving forward faith looks like number one is this is you must move forward afraid you must move forward afraid faith isn't the absence of fear faith is moving forward in spite of your fear i think about moses we're gonna look at the life of moses today when you look at moses moses moved forward afraid if you don't know the story god told moses moses to go back to egypt he said i want you to deliver my people the people of israel they have been in slavery for 400 years and when god told us to moses moses was afraid look at his response in exodus chapter 4 verse 1 moses answered what what if they do not believe me or listen to me and say the lord did not appear to you he was afraid he was afraid of how the people would react look at his response in exodus 4 10 moses said to the lord pardon your servant lord i i've never been eloquent i mean you're asking me to do all this but i've never been eloquent neither in past nor since you have spoken to your servant i'm slow of speech and tongue he's insecure he's scared of how he may say scared he may mess it up and he's trying to tell god i'm not cut out for this and and look what he goes on exodus 4 13 he's like all right god you're not hearing me he said but moses said pardon your servant lord please send someone else he just said let me let me just make it clear for you i'm afraid please please send someone else moses was afraid and he gave god every excuse in the book but god said no no no i've called you i've chosen you go and moses he moved forward afraid see people with big faith aren't people who don't have fears they just move forward in spite of their fears faith isn't the absence of fear hear me faith is moving forward in spite of your fear you have to let your faith be bigger than your fear i can tell you that every major step of faith that i've taken in my life i was afraid i battled fear i i used to be scared to death of speaking in public absolutely no way you're going to put me on a stage with the microphone i just pat pass i mean i uh oh no i would not show up i'll go ahead try to put me up there i'm not i'm scared and then i remember the first time i felt god calling me to preach a sermon oh my stomach like oh and then the opportunity came that whole day stomach is in knots heart is racing i was shaking for the first ten minutes of preaching i mean i was scared to death but i thank god that my faith was bigger than my fear and that i did it afraid i remember when god called me to full-time ministry i was like moses god pardon me excuse me pick someone else i don't want to be a pastor that like that life scared me that that responsibility scared me that calling scared me i remember arguing got a whole night just scared man i can't do this i i don't i'm not i don't know the bible i don't i'm a nobody in it just remember being afraid but i thank god my faith was bigger than my fear and i did it i remember going away to bible college i don't want to leave indianapolis i loved indianapolis trying to send me to springfield missouri i don't want to go no springfield like i was scared i didn't want to leave my family i didn't want it but i was scared but but i did it afraid moving to oklahoma city when we went to be youth pastor over there we never been to oklahoma city i don't know what's over there i'm like man people running around with with with cowboys and indians no joke y'all our first week in oklahoma city in our neighborhood a student shot another student not with a gun an arrow step up on my yard boom arrow i'm like oh lord we need to go back to indianapolis i didn't know what i mean i was scared we didn't know nobody we're now 13 hours away from our family but i thank god that we did it afraid we were afraid to start the indie campus just felt inadequate there's insecurities there's fear there's doubt but we did it afraid don't let fear be bigger than your faith if you're going to move forward you got to move forward afraid number two you move forward when it's risky you move forward when it's risky obeying god and moving forward in faith was risky for moses if you don't know the backstory he had fled egypt 40 years ago because he had killed an egyptian and now god is telling him to go back to a place where he's wanted for for murder not only that god's like i want you to not only go back to that place but i want you to confront pharaoh hold up god you mean confront billy joe no no no pharaoh the most powerful man in the country you don't confront pharaoh you will be dead you know what i mean that would be the last i mean it was risky for moses to go back to a country where he's wanted for murder to go and and confront merrell that it's risky it took ridiculous faith and moses he moved forward even when it was risky listening starting people's church indianapolis was risky most churches with campuses their campus is 30 15 to 30 maybe 45 minutes away not three states away you know what i mean like normally you can just drive to all the campuses and visit them and and check them out you know what i mean and still have plenty of gas no we're talking it was risky it was risky for pastor herbert it was risky we had never done this before we had never started an out of state campus we never started a live speaking campus and here we are three days away there was risk but i thank god that we took the risk because we're not only the first we won't be the last we're gonna do many more out of state campuses because we took a risk move forward when it was risky number three you move forward without all the details oh i know some of you i'll rebuke that pastor chris the devil is a lie you tell me to move forward without all the i need the details for some of you detailed folks some of us like i don't need no details i'm like you crazy moses obeyed god and he moved forward without all the details he had think about this he had no timetable timetable of when god was going to deliver the people out of egypt he didn't know if it would happen in a day or another 40 years he didn't he wasn't giving those details he didn't know how god was going to deliver god just said i want you to go into confront he didn't know what was going to happen how would he have any of the it was ridiculous faith for him to go back to egypt and confront pharaoh without all the details and then when he confronts pharaoh oh the unexpected happens read with me exodus 5 20 through 23. it says as they left pharaoh's court they confronted it's the people of israel the people that moses came to deliver they confronted moses and aaron who are waiting outside for them the four men said to them may the lords judge and punish you for making us stink before pharaoh and his officials you have put a sword into their hands an excuse to kill us then moses went back to the lord and protested why have you brought all this trouble on your own people lord why did you send me like you didn't tell me anything like why ever since i came to pharaoh as your spokesman he has been even more brutal to your people and you've done nothing to rescue them see after moses confronted pharaoh pharaoh decided he was going to make life as hard as he possibly could on the jewish people and the jewish people wanted god to punish moses for this i'm sure moses was like you could have warned the brother you could have let me know moses has to be thinking god why didn't you tell me this was going to happen here's why god never gives us all the details when he asks us to step out in faith he might like why listen if you have all the details that's not faith there's no faith if you got all the details and all the information god doesn't oftentimes all god gives us is the next step he says well you trust me think about joseph joseph had a dream from god at 17 years old that he was going to be a powerful leader but he had no idea of all the details he had no idea the ups and the downs that he was gonna matter of fact if he knew all the details he might have got real quiet about that little coat he had and about the dreams he had he might have got real silent once he found out what his brothers were going to do he didn't have all the details but he moved forward in faith david was anointed and promised that he would be the next king of israel but had no idea when or how but he moved forward with faith god told abraham he was going to be a father of many nations all right which one lord i'm not don't worry about that i'm not going to tell you okay what nation do you want me to go right now it's not important just start walking and i'll let you know when you get there say what i mean that's what god said to him look at the hebrews 11 8 it said it was by faith that abraham obeyed when god called him to leave home and go to another land that god would give him as his inheritance and the bible says he went without knowing where he was going that's ridiculous faith yo lord if you ask me to leave my i gotta know am i going to a city am i going to the country is there a walmart stop lights is it hot is it called i need something come on give me is there a target how about a starbucks i just need to know lord what i am getting myself into you know what i mean if i can be able to buy a house like like i got to know some details and god doesn't give us all the details often times he just gives us the next step i know in my faith journey i've never had all the details many people don't know this i think because we're a campus of people's church and and jamie and i were on staff at people's church in oklahoma city many people believed that we moved here to to start a people's church campus but that is not the case we didn't move here to start the people's church campus that was never an idea or even a thought at least in our mind we left people's church and we knew that god was just calling us back to indianapolis we didn't know what that was going to look like we were going to get a phone call from a church as a church looking for a pastor is a pastor about to retire are we going to have to plant ourselves and you know maybe it's going to take a couple years maybe we need to find a job on staff at a church we had no idea we just knew that god was calling us back to the northeast side of indianapolis and so we moved here by faith without all the details we moved back here it was in june we pastor herbert brought up a people's church campus in october and we so we just we just didn't even know now when he brought that up we knew exactly what god was doing but we didn't have all the details and oftentimes we won't the bible says in and it says in psalm excuse me it says in psalm 37 23 it says the righteous man steps are ordered of the lord you just got to know your steps are ordered god has ordered your steps and oftentimes all he does is give you the next step and then the next step and so we thank god that we took the step we thank god that we took the step we didn't know how it was all going to look or what it was going to be we just knew god had called us here to impact this city and then october when we got the phone call to start the first out of state further we just took that step and then we had to find a school and we took that step and and we didn't know how it all were going to look but we thank god that even though we didn't have all of the details we moved forward by faith god wants us to move forward even when we don't have all the details and trusting god that he'll always show us the next step he may not show all the steps but it'll show the next one number four number four you move forward when it does not make sense you move forward when it does not make sense moses moved forward and it didn't all make sense i mean think about it the people of israel have been in slavery for 400 years under pharaoh the most powerful man in the country and god is sending one man moses who is scared doesn't even want to go please send someone else he's not sending an army he's sending moses and his family to deliver the people of israel makes no sense and then god says hey you're going to cross the red sea on dry ground lord you mean a dry boat no dry ground makes no sense but there they were walking on dry ground as the red sea split then god said hey you gonna go live in a desert there's gonna be no water and food but that's okay i'm gonna make it rain manna from heaven you're like you mean bananas no no no manna all right and then when you're thirsty you need water go hit a rock gonna make water come out of it makes no sense and then when they get to the promised land they're ready they're like okay we're ready we got our army we're gonna storm the gates guys like no no no i just want you to march around the walls okay we need conditioning before we attack all right all right all right god i got you you know gotta make sure our blood pressure's right you know what i mean pulse is going good and so they're marching around you're gonna march around seven times all right marshall and then we're gonna take it over we're gonna storm it no no no you can march around seven times and you're just gonna yell and the walls are gonna come crumbling down makes no sense no sense whatsoever but they moved forward in faith and they entered the promised land listen people who have ridiculous faith they move forward when things don't make sense come on people's church are you ready to move forward in faith so you can please god come on there's a pandemic but you're moving forward gas prices are high but you're moving forward you have personal problems but you're moving forward you've had some setbacks but you're moving forward 2021 has been a challenging year but we are moving forward in faith everything doesn't make sense but we're moving forward in faith we're moving forward we're moving forward let me tell you about a time in our lives in jamie's lives where god really challenged our faith really challenged us to move forward when it didn't all make sense and it was in the area of our giving jamie and i have always been tithers since we've been married we always tithe we return 10 to the lords it's his and so we've always been tithers and we have always given offerings offerings are over and above the tithe so for as long as we've been married every year when we we look over our budget and we're getting ready for next year uh we would determine what we were going to give over and above our tithe to dream builders or missionaries whatever it was okay and so oftentimes the way that this looked is we would go and and we were what i would call budget givers okay when it came time for us to determine what we're going to give next year we'd go look to the budget that's a good that's a wise thing we would go look to the budget and we would look at what we have and based off what we have we determined what we would give monthly over and above our tithe now we weren't just budget givers and again we always gave every month but we were also sacrificial givers okay so it wasn't just okay what do we have there there are times we cut expenses there were times where we made sacrifices and we cut things out of our budget so that we could give more okay and it was probably about eight or ten years or so we had been on staff at people's church and again we've always given and whenever it's time to pray about the next year and what we want to give again we'd go to the budget we'd pray and then give and there are there are a few times in my life where i feel like god has spoken crystal clear to me it's not all the time i wish i wish it was i wish it was every day but outside of god's word right that's if you want to hear from god every day read his word all right but but like an audible like voice telling me something and because this is what i would do i would look to the budget and then we would determine what we give i remember god saying this because i remember the the sermon was about giving by faith and i remember god saying this to me said chris are you really giving by faith if you go look at your budget first and then come ask me i was like whoo well lord no that that's not it's not quite given by faith and so i just remember so clearly from god god says i want you to stop looking at your budget i want you to come to me and i want you to pray and ask me what i would have you give now after that you can go to the budget because when i talk to you you may need to cut some things and you may need to adjust your budget and look at it right and i remember having this conversation with james i said man that the lord has really convicted me we always give all right because we believe in giving but we've always looked at the budget first and i believe and i told jerusalem god wants us to talk to him first and pray and the number that he gives us we need to make a commitment to that and and do everything we can to give that and uh uh jamie she's just she's full of faith she's like oh yeah absolutely she's like let's let's go i'm like oh lord be careful what you'd be telling my wife lord oh she gonna come up with numbers and i'm like oh so i'm always a little nervous hey babe what's the lord telling you but listen this was about 10 years ago and you know what every year we go to god first and sure enough god gives us a number then we look at the budget there's no way we can make it happen there's no way and we wrestle we wrestle we pray and god said will you trust me will you trust me and i can i tell you for the last eight to ten years god's always given us a number and sometimes he's giving us a number we're like gotta i just have no idea how we're gonna give that this year i just have no idea i know what our income is i know what our expenses are god we're even gonna cut and there is just literally without intervention there's no way we're going to give that but we've made that commitment and every year god supplies every year he makes away now again he makes the way but we don't spend the way okay all right listen all right we get that where that unexpected 500 check oh girl let's go today let's go to let's go to cheesecake factory and ruth chris no no we like men that's the lord's we give that to him and you know what every year what god has done we've been able to do things we dreamed of every year we're able to give thousands over and above our tithe to missions to see more changed lives it doesn't make sense there's times he gives us numbers that does not make sense but we trust him and he has made a way i'll never forget one year we were like we have no idea how we're gonna do this we're even looking at the whole year and i remember this was probably the one where i was like lord i either ate something or man and in my mind it would have taken all of the year and everything we sat in june and we had given the full amount and god was like listen will you trust me will you trust me make the commitment and give it didn't make sense at all we end up giving more than we ever thought we could ever imagine and listen it's moving forward in faith moving forward in faith even when it all doesn't make sense let me give you number five here you move forward in spite of your inadequacies in spite of your inadequacies people who have a faith that pleases god realize god doesn't use us because of us he uses us in spite of us anybody thankful for that today he uses us in spite of us listen if you got some issues and some problems you are in good company because all throughout the bible god used people in spite of their inadequacies moses he was a murderer had a stuttering problem sarah she was too old to have a baby but at 90 years old she did caleb he was too old to take the promised land but at 85 years old he stepped into the promised land david was too young to fight goliath he was somewhere around 13 to 18. no way he could defeat goliath but god did ridiculous and miraculous through his life david messed up too bad to be king of israel he had an affair he was a murderer but god forgave him restored him and used him jacob was a liar and a deceiver joseph was abused by his own family and falsely accused gideon was scared he was hiding he was the weakest in his family and clan but he moved forward in faith and god used him elijah was suicidal jonah ran from god naomi was a widow job went bankrupt you're some good company here rahab was a prostitute peter had an anger problem and denied christ three times paul persecuted the church the disciples fell asleep while praying with jesus martha worried about everything zacchaeus was too small timothy had an ulcer the samaritan woman was divorced five times and lazarus was dead y'all don't you tell me that god can't use you to do the miraculous to do the ridiculous and use you in ridiculous ways all you got to do is you got to keep moving forward in faith keep moving forward in faith even when you're scared keep moving forward in faith even when it doesn't make sense keep moving forward in faith even when it's risky keep moving forward in faith even when you don't have all the details keep moving forward in faith even when you're feeling inadequate and you know all your issues and all your problems keep moving forward in faith it pleases god and he'll use you in ridiculous and miraculous ways and here at people's church we're going to keep moving forward in faith we're going to keep moving forward in faith to see more changed lives we're going to keep moving forward in faith to reach our city and reach the entire world i shared this with you last week but right now we're looking right now that we we this building we're in right now it's elise and we're believing god in 2022 we're going to own our own building we're going to buy land to own our own land own our own building in a prime location like pastor where i don't have all the details but god does and i look forward to when he reveals them to us well i just can tell you we're moving forward in faith and we're believing next year we're going to own our own land our own property where we're one church in five locations but next year we're starting a sixth location in edmond oklahoma we're moving forward in faith we're gonna be one church in six locations jamie and i we we lived in edmond oklahoma we're excited to see another people's church there and what god is gonna do we're moving forward in faith we're gonna keep giving to local missions national missions international we're gonna continue supporting those hundred orphans in eighty we're gonna continue to help people plant churches we're gonna continue to support our missionaries and add more missionaries why because we're moving forward in faith we're moving forward in faith and you can move forward with us just want to go over this commitment card when you leave today we'll be passing these out to everybody and please hear me if you are new to people's church we are not asking you for anything just want you to know you're a part of a church that has big vision and big dreams but if you call people's church your home we're going to give you a card it says big faith big future 20 21 22 commitment and on the back of it it says what are my next steps and so i want to give those to you number one is this if you're not a tither would you move forward in faith and start tithing would you become a consistent tither in 2021 20 22. come on god god he he he is pleased when we move in faith move forward in faith today and start tithing the the next step on there it says would you pray and ask god well he would have you give over and above your tithe to dream builders for us to see more changed lives jamie right now that's what we're doing we're praying and asking god do it every year we're so we're doing it right now for next year we're listening to god what he would have us commit what he would have us give over and above our tithe to see more change lives over and above our tithes so that we can by land or a building over and above our tithes that we can continue to support missionaries local missions international and national missions the third step on there is we'd love it if you could if you could submit this card and your commitment by november 21st and then lastly would you give your best miracle offering on december 5th december 5th is miracle offering sunday the miracle offering you give it goes towards your dream builders commitment would you give your best offering would you give as much as you can as quick as you can every year at the miracle offering jamie and i we try to get bigger we try to give the biggest we've ever given and we're going to do that again this year we're praying we're seeking god we're trusting god and so would you would you do that with us and give to the miracle offering so that we can accelerate the vision to see more changed lives listen when we move forward in faith god will do the ridiculous in and through our lives listen moses none of it made sense he was scared god choose someone else but he moved forward in faith and moses saw miracle after can you imagine when he goes and confronts pharaoh and pharaoh doesn't kill him miracle can you imagine when finally pharaoh says fine let the people go and all of a sudden now everyone needs you but here is moses leading the people out of 400 years of slavery what a miracle can you imagine they're going and also not the red sea like oh lord you've done so many miracles and now we got this body of water and like god's like it's okay you're gonna cross on dry land can you imagine listen it was because moses moved forward in faith he walked through a miracle walked on dry grand with the water standing still then they got to the desert and manna came down he ate a miracle because he moved forward in faith water came out of the rock he drank a miracle because he moved forward in faith he he ended up he played a part in the people getting back to the promised land why because he moved forward in faith god is asking us wherever you are today listen don't go backwards don't have a stagnant faith listen god wants you to have a flourishing faith that is moving forward day by day by day come on would you stand with me all across this room i believe miracles are going to happen as we move forward in faith we're going to sing this song can we make this song our prayer would you believe more than you've ever believed before would you pray bigger than you've ever prayed before come on we are moving forward in faith and when we do that miracles happen miracles happen come on would you sing this with me come on worship the lord let him fill you with faith come on lift your hands right now lift your hand say god i don't know how but i'm trusting you i'm surrendering to you wherever you say to go i'm going whatever you're saying again i'm giving whatever you say to do i'm doing whatever you say to sir i'm serving god i'm moving forward [Music] [Music] fill [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] miracles [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] can we give god praise in this place call us thank him in advance for the miracles the breakthrough jesus we're moving forward [Music] in faith one step at a time with heads still bowed and eyes still closed for some of you today the step is very clear for whatever reason you don't have a relationship with god and i want you to know that god loves you that he sent his son jesus to die on a cross for you so that all your sins could be forgiven so that he could be lord of your life so that when you die that you won't spend eternity away from god in a place called hell but you would spend eternity with god in heaven so if you're here today and you need to take that step i want to give you that opportunity he loves you he sees you and he's just waiting for you to take a step of faith and give him your heart in life you don't have to have it all figured out that's why it's called faith you don't have to have your life all together that's why it's

iDrynulJImE,"the title of my message today is preparing for a miracle Ephesians 3:20 says God is able to do far more exceedingly abundantly above and beyond what we could ever ask think or imagine I I want this verse to become real in your life I want you to experience the more that God has for your life I've asked you to be committed to a small group for8 weeks and I want to say thank you to every small group leader thank you to our Brotherhood and Sisterhood table leaders come on can we give it up for them right now thank you thank you thank you tons of people are learning how to step into the more that God has for them because of you even people outside of our church are learning about uh the more that God has for their life through these small groups we're also enjoying the devotionals together as a church in the more guide and if you haven't received a more guide or the more booklet after service stop by uh guest Central in the lobby we want to give you that more booklet inside of it our daily devotions there's testimonies um and so we want you to have that and believe it'll be a blessing to your life throughout this series we've learned that we all want to know the will of God and want to experience the more that God has for our lives and our church and to do this you have to live out Romans 121 and be a Living Sacrifice you have to leave where you are to go to where God wants to take you we never outgrow surrendering to God last week we learned to experience more we have to hear the voice of God and then do what he says God is a speaking God and God is speaking to each of us during this spiritual journey and you need to hear his voice and do what he says this week we're going to talk about how to prepare for a miracle there are times in life where we all need a miracle where you need God to show up with his power and I want to teach you how to receive a miracle from God now hear me we can never try to turn God into a formula okay but there are principles in Scripture that teach us how to prepare to receive a miracle from God the particular Miracle we're going to study today we see four times in the gospel and when there's a story in the Bible four times we ought to pay attention to it and learn the principles from it the first principle is this you have to have a need Mark chapter 6 verse 35-36 it says by this time it was late in the day so his disciples came to him this is a remote place they said and it's already very late send the people away so that they can go to S the surrounding Countryside and Villages and buy themselves something to eat let me give you the setting here there's a crowd of about 15 to 20,000 people is getting late they're in a remote place there's no Chick-fil-A there's no Dees the disciples see the people are getting hungry kids are getting tired and hungry there's a huge need a big need and you know everybody says they want to see God do the miraculous but people don't want to have miraculous needs people want to have big God stories but not big God needs they want to have big God testimonies without big God tests they want big God breakthroughs without big God obstacles you can't have a miracle without a need and today some of you are a candidate for a miracle because you have some big needs and I've got some great news for you today every Miracle God has ever done always started with a need if you have a big need that means you are a candidate for a big miracle maybe your marriage or relationships are in big trouble your finances your health your career your children are in big trouble you're a candidate for a big miracle we serve a miracle working God nothing is impossible for our great God and our church is a candidate for miracle we have some big needs we have some big vision and this is not my vision it's not Pastor Herbert's Vision it's not our staff's vision it's not your vision this is God's vision and I believe I'm just articulating what's on the heart of God for our church we have a big need to renovate our first permanent home renovations that will take our space from 30,000 square ft to 45,000 Square ft and a large lobby with a cafe so that people can build Godly relationships a secure and Safe Kids area for kids to learn about Jesus and develop a strong faith around a 900 seat state of the are Auditorium where we will have Sunday services and we have a big need of $3 million to renovate this facility our first permanent home for one purpose purpose to see more changed lives we have a big need and we serve a big God a God who specializes in Miracles number two the second principle is you have to put what you have in Jesus's hands Mark 6:37 but he Jesus answered you give them something to eat Jesus said you give them something to eat you meet the need you do what you can do you get involved in this miracle let me give you four reasons people don't put what they have in Jesus's hands first people don't understand that God wants them to participate in the miracle Jesus tells us the same thing he told his disciples you give them something to eat many people never experienced the miraculous because they don't understand that God wants to use them to be a part of the miracle see a lot of people don't want a miracle they want magic they don't want to do anything they just want to sit back and all of a sudden Abracadabra Hocus Pocus Shazam and there's a miracle that's not how God works God wants your participation in the miracle he wants you to put what you have in his hands so why don't people put what they have in God's hands secondly people have more logic than Faith Mark 6:37 but he answered you give them something to eat they said to him that would take more than a half a Year's wages are we to go out and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat the disciple says Lord this doesn't make mathematical sense we are doing the math and it would take half a Year's wages to feed all these people come on Jesus be logical we need a better plan how many of you can find yourself being like those disciples and analyzing everything through your logic and your plan I know I can be that way I'm a big analyzer I'm I'm very logical and I'm a big planner Jamie and I plan out our year we plan out our budget we live on a budget Jamie and I have kept ourselves out of debt besides our home we are logical and planners our staff and leadership team they run the church on a budget and with a plan we have an audit every year and I thank God for clean audits year after year I'm grateful we have strategic plans for our church because I love having a plan but if I'm not careful I will logic analyze and plan God right out of my life in our church and if some of you aren't careful you'll do the same thing you will be so analytical and logical and you will push God right out of your life and situation think about this have you ever stepped out in bold Faith with God and then seen him show up in your life with a miracle when's the last time you stepped out in bold faith and watched God show up and do a miracle when's the last time you had bold audacious and big faith in God on several occasions Jamie and I we have pushed past our own logic and reasoning to step into the more that God had for us it wasn't logical when we gave all of our savings to another church plant right before we planted People's Church it was n logical when Jamie and I stepped out in faith and made a one-year commitment of $10,000 over and above our tithe to the dreambuilders building project to see more changed lives even in this season in our life it's not logical for us to make the largest financial commitment we've ever made and give the largest Miracle offering that we've ever given our oldest is about to go off to college in about a year and a half and his sister is right on his heels how know it's about to be an expensive season for us in the next few years but Jamie and I have a strong faith in God because time and time again we've seen God do Miracles when we put what we have in Jesus's hands I I shared this with you last week and I want to share it again because God wants each of us to deepen our trust in him and that's three levels of giving the first level is what can I afford what can I give without giving anything up this is all logic there's very little faith at this level the second level is what can I sacrifice what can I give only if I give something up it's good for us all to sacrifice but it doesn't require a lot of faith it's more logical and planning the third level is what can I trust God to do through through me what can I give only if I give something up and then trust God to be my source this level requires God's miracle working power to work in our life this is the faith commitment level Faith gives because God asks for it not because it's logical Faith gives because God asks for it not because it's logical the reason people don't get to the third level of what can I trust God to do through me is because thirdly they Overlook the god Factor the god Factor doesn't make any sense it messes up our logic our analysis and our plans logic and plans are all about what can happen if you keep what you have in your hands but the god factor is when you step out in faith and put what you have in God God's hands many people Overlook what can happen when they take their fish and bread and they put it into the hands of Jesus they're so focused on what they can do they don't leave room for what God can do Church it matters whose hands it's in a football in my hand is worth about $60 a wobbly pass and probably an interception but a football in Patrick M H's hands is worth $45 million a year a basketball in my hands is worth about $50 and every once in a while hitting a jump shot but a basketball in LeBron James hands is worth 50 million a year two fish and Five Loaves in the disciples hands is still two fish and Five Loaves but put it in Jesus's hands and it feeds 20,000 people it matters ERS whose hands it's in put what you have in Jesus's hands one last reason we don't put what we have in Jesus's hands is it's hard to care for others when we are comfortable ourselves in John 69 it says they found a boy who had five pieces of bread and two fish see there was only one person in the crowd that day who didn't need a miracle from God it was that young boy who had the lunch that his mom made for him earlier that morning before he left the house that day that little boy could have told Jesus you can't have my lunch mine is I sure hate that people don't have anything to eat Jesus I feel bad for them but I'm hungry too I'm taking care of I hope they find some food it can be challenging to give your lunch to Jesus when your life is going good and we have to remember that it's not all about us it's about people who don't know Jesus it's about those that are not here yet it's about those who need to experience the lifechanging power of Jesus Christ is about more changed lives we're already going to heaven now it's about how many people can we take with us and we have to put our lunch in Jesus's hands because it's not about us Jesus multiply our lunch so that more people can know his grace and mercy and love you will never leave a legacy for God just focusing on yourself you will never step into the more that God has for you by only living for yourself here's the third principle God does miracle mirales when we partner with him Mark 6: 41- 42 says taking the Five Loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people he also divided the two fish among them all they all ate and were sa satisfied I want to give you two principles of partnering with God so you can experience Miracles the first principle is this partnering with God begins by giving what you have one of the greatest mistakes is to do nothing because you can only do little that little boy only had two fish and Five Loaves but he gave his little to Jesus the way God does Miracles is when we give what we have to Jesus because little is much when God gets involved so don't wait to give your lunch to Jesus right now give what you have to the Lord and allow him to multiply it number two partnering with God requires Steps of Faith and obedience the Bible says the disciples obeyed Jesus and took the bread and began to distribute it to the people the miracle happened as they stepped out in faith and began to distribute the bread and fish this is so important miracles happen when you start Distributing what you have see so many people are so focused on what they don't have so they never start Distributing what they do have well I'll start giving when I get a race when the business deal goes through then I'll give when I get out of all this debt when the economy is doing better or when the election is over then I'll give to the Lord but it's when you start Distributing what you have God shows up with his power God wants to partner with you to do the miraculous without God we cannot and without us God will not you have to start Distributing what you already have and then God shows up and multiplies it we just had this happen with a family in our church listen to what was set in by Julian and Cammy I said on Tuesday my husband and I felt like God was telling us to give $1,000 in the miracle offering this October through December and $110,000 over the next three years we had no idea how we were going to come up with this but said we will limit Christmas to only our kids and even small gifts to them Friday morning we woke up to find a little more than $10,000 in our bank account from the VA that neither of us were expecting after looking at the payment it was only $150 shy of paying all of our credit card debt off completely and by paying this off we will be able to use the amount we were paying monthly towards the three-year commitment and now we will be able to give $25,000 in three years God is amazing he gave us exactly what we asked for and because of this we will be able to give more than twice what he promised what we promised to give come on that's God right there that's God and as soon as they decided as soon as they decided to give God ,000 do God showed up and multiplied it you have to put what you have in Jesus's hands fourth principle partnering with Jesus produces more changed lives first it changes your life it changes your life when you see God do a miracle through you that little boy went home telling his mom how Jesus multiplied his lunch and fed thousands his mom said boy stop lying what happened to that lunch he told his friends at school the rest of his life he told everyone how Jesus performed a miracle because he gave his lunch to Jesus I want you to have miraculous stories to tell your children your grandchildren your friends your family and co-workers I want you to be able to say I partnered with Jesus during the more spiritual journey campaign and God did miracles in my life and in my church secondly it changes other people's lives John 6:14 it says after the people saw the sign Jesus performed they began to say surely this is the prophet who is to come and to the world when we partner with Jesus it changes lives every single week we see lives changed at People's Church that's why we do do what we do when I was a little kid my family didn't really talk about Jesus we would go to church on Christmas and on Easter but that was about it I was a honorable student never got in trouble I was in all kinds of sports when I was about 13 years old I was at church camp and my mom picked me up and I knew something was wrong and she had told me that my dad had only had 6 months to live he ended up living for 2 years but he died at the age of 38 from drug and alcohol abuse when my dad passed away I just gave up on everything I started hanging out with the wrong crowd I started drinking doing drugs having sex I got pregnant at the age of 14 had my daughter when I was 15 I always wanted to be a nurse that's what my grandma was I tried going to College I fa a drug test and I got tested out so then I just started doing harder drugs smoking it wasn't enough for me anymore so I started using a needle my life spired out of control so I gave temporary custy of my daughter to my mom I lost everything that I had my child everything I owned my car my house I just knew that I was either going to die or I was going to go to jail for the rest of my life I just remember being in a jail cell and I got on my hands and knees and I just asked for God's forgiveness and to take me out of that lifestyle that was literally life or death for me when I got out of rehab I saw a sign for People's Church um they were out of the middle school at the time and I decided to attend when I first walked in they were just so friendly so welcoming they just treated me like family they didn't look at my ankle bracelet they looked past that and they just Lov me and was there for me my life just started changing I started meeting people at People's Church the small groups the people that I met there they just welcomed me with open arms I just raised my hand on Easter Sunday 2017 and said yes to Jesus have my daughter at such a young age and then giving my mom temporary custody she went through all that with me I believe it was 2017 it might have been 2018 but Mother's Day me and my daughter got baptized together here since going to People's Church and giving my life to Jesus I got married had another son bought a house and this past June I passed my boards to become a registered nurse I never would have thought my life would be what it is today I just started coming to church and serving and like God just started pouring blessings over me things started happening that I never thought would be able to happen with you know being an addict and you know being in and- out of Joe and going through that lifestyle I just never thought that this life was possible [Music] amen what it's all about I still remember Crystal coming to People's Church when we were at Fall Creek Valley mle mid school it's been incredible she's a walking Miracle everything that God has done in her life because she put her life in Jesus's hands and at People's Church we're in everyone's Church want to see everyone saved everyone healed everyone restored want to see everyone touched by the power I've got everyone discover their purpose and that's why we're asking everyone to be committed cuz there are more crystals out there you have crystals in your family friends at work in your neighborhood they need Jesus they need a place where it's okay not to be okay they need a church like People's Church where they could come with their habits and hurts and Hang-Ups and they can come and their life be transformed by the power of God and so that's why we're asking everyone to be committed everyone committed to attending two Sundays in a row October 16th through the 13 everyone to committed to attending a small group for eight weeks everyone committed to making a three-year commitment on October the 6th this week I'm asking you to pray over your commitment card and come to church next Sunday ready to fill out your cards the cards are in the paperbag your lunch bag like the little boy the cards are in that bag you can take the bag you can take the card and together this week let's pray over the cards and then together next week we're all going to make a three-year Financial commitment over and above our tithe to renovate our first permanent home to see more changed lives we're asking everyone to be committed to giving in the miracle offering October 13th through December 31st everyone giving your best offering towards your three-year commitment your best offering may be 10 20 30 40 50% of your threeyear commitment and if you're a guest please feel no obligation to make a commitment or to give but our church is doing this because we want to see more changed lives People's Church is all about more changed lives there are more crystals look into drugs and and different things and all the wrong place there are more C crystals that need a second chance that need our church that need hope that need Jesus and we want to do all we can we want to hear from God so that we can make a difference to see more changed lives"
JF4hlNbRz-0,well today we are continuing our series called dysfunctional why relationships are not working and I just want to encourage you to continue to attend every week if you missed a week you can go back on our YouTube page and watch the message but if you'll attend every single week I believe your relationships will get better and the title of my message today is why communication is not working why communication is not working a friend of mine shared with me a story that him and a buddy when they were around seven years old they found some matches and they went into one of the rooms in the house and they started lighting the matches and seeing what you know they started playing with fire and so they lit a match and they lit some paper on fire and then they lit another match and tried to light a little stick on fire and they're watching it burn and so then now they're getting Legos they're getting creative here let's see what happens if we light a Lego on fire and I think it just melted a little bit and who knows they may have grabbed a little action figure so just doing all this and all of a sudden they had this idea let's see if the carpet will catch on fire and so they lit the match and they lit the carpet and it caught fire but all of a sudden the fire kept growing and they're they're trying to blow it out they couldn't blow it out and the the carpet catches more on fire so they run out of the room and they close the door because right when you're seven if you just run out the room and close the door and go hide in another room it's gonna make it all better oh no it did not if fire alarms are going off the whole carpet caught on fire I mean luckily the fire department was able to get out there and get it put out but they learned a valuable valuable lesson that day and you know one of the top reasons why relationships aren't working is people's words are setting their relationships on fire people say all types of things in their relationships and then they walk out they close the door and they walk away and their marriage is on fire their kids are on fire their friendships are on fire their co-workers are on fire their boyfriend and girlfriend are on fire let me ask you a question today is your mouth setting your relationships on fire some of your words have started a fire and you just keep talking and throwing more gas on it your your tongue your mouth you just walking around relationships on fire and just pouring gasoline all over your relationships look what the Bible says in James chapter 3 verse 5 and 6. it says likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts consider what a great Forest is set on fire by a small Spark the tongue also is a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole body sets the whole course of one's life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell your tongue can set the whole course of your life on fire some of you your life and your relationships are on fire because of your tongue research says that the average people speak on average people speak seven thousand words a day that is seven thousand opportunities to set a relationship on fire another study showed on average we have 27 conversations per day that is 27 opportunities to set your relationships on fire relationships are not working because communication is not working some studies show that communication problems is the number one reason why couples get a divorce I know oftentimes when I talk to people about dysfunction in their relationships whether it's marriage whether it's with a parent or child or relatives or co-workers or dating or friendships most dysfunction can be traced back to poor communication poor communication have you feeling frustrated distant confused tension anger and resentment and if you will improve your communication you will improve your relationships look at Psalm 34 Verse 12-13 it says whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies this is such an important scripture that Peter referenced it in his writings first Peter 3 10 for the scriptures say if you want to enjoy life and see many happy days keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies the quality of your communication will determine the quality of your life and relationships and and so today we're going to put out fires and improve our communication I want to start off by sharing with you four barriers that lead to bad communication for barriers that lead to bad communication the first barrier is this it's beginning with the wrong approach Proverbs 18 21 it says the tongue has the power of life and death so much debt death is happening in communication because people don't understand the power of their words and when you don't understand the power of your words you don't value your approach bad communication begins with a bad approach approach matters more than most people realize look what Proverbs 15 1 says it says a gentle answer turns away Wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger the Bible is pointing out the power of approach you can say the same thing and have two very different responses could you please take out the trash today or can you please take out the trash and then you grab the gasoline can well you think that trash got legs trash been sitting in there I asked you will you please and you just pouring gas the approach the approach matters Proverbs 29 22 it says an angry person starts fights a hot tempered person commits all kinds of sin and people they begin talking they just start off with a gasoline can in their hand angry hot temper just pouring gas all over the fire they create fear they don't make it safe to have a conversation and they're just pouring gas on their relationships Proverbs 15 18. it says a hot tempered person stirs up conflict Proverbs 25 15 it says patience can persuade a prince and soft speech can break bones the message says it this way it says gentle speech can break down rigid defenses taking the approach of being patient and gentle in your communication versus impatient and angry makes a big difference whenever we're impatient and angry we are grabbing the gas can and we are just adding fuel to the fire but when we're patient and we're gentle poor nice cool water on our relationships let me give you the second barrier the second barrier is being quick to talk being quick to talk is a communication barrier that will set your relationships on fire people who are quick to talk really don't care what the other person has to say they just want to talk and be heard Proverbs 18 13 it says to answer before listening that is folly in shame you just pouring gasoline on that relationship Proverbs 17 verse 27 and 28 it says a truly wise person uses few words a person with understanding is even tempered even fools are thought wise when they keep silent and their mouths shut they seem intelligent the Bible is teaching us to listen more than we talk proverbs 10 19 too much talk leads to sin too much talk we start picking up the gas can and pouring it on our relationships let me give you the third barrier third barrier is bringing the attack to the person instead of the problem Proverbs 26 21 a quarrelsome person starts fights as easily as hot Embers like charcoal or fire lights would some people are just quarrelsome you know what I'm talking about every those folks just they just love to argue and fight now don't Point come on don't Point don't don't point don't don't side eye anybody in the room because you know what you just did you just started a fight in an argument on your drive home but some folks quarrel some quarrelsome people are always attacking others with their communication instead of focusing on the problem they're launching personal attacks just pouring gasoline they're disrespectful they're trying to hurt others with their words they're constantly interrupting people when they talk they raise their voice to intimidate they're defensive and just pour in gasoline number four the fourth barrier is this backing away from tough conversations let me explain another big barrier is some of you avoid conflict you avoid tough conversations listen avoiding the tough conversation is false comfort it's like those little boys Who lit that rug on fire oh and they just ignored it walked out the room closed the door and went and hide but listen when you avoid tough conversations you're closing the door on the problem but it's still there and the fire is growing and listen I I understand it's not easy but to have healthy relationships you have to be willing to have tough conversation the Bible says it this way Ephesians 4 15 instead speaking the truth and love there's a barrier in your relationships because you're not speaking the truth in love and so you have to stop avoiding the tough conversations I now want to give you six ways to build a bridge of communication come on let's stop Burning Bridges and let's start building bridges with our words for these six points we're actually going to spell the word Bridge all right we're gonna we're gonna use the word bridge to improve our communication so we can improve our relationship and so here's the B the b in Bridge stands for this begin with me begin with me whenever you're having a problem in one of your in one of your relationships always begin with you see your natural reaction to a communication problem is to begin with the other person what they need to change what they're doing wrong but to build a bridge of communication it's important to begin with you what can you do better to improve the communication what can you do to improve your approach your tone your anger your patience Matthew 7 5 it says you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the spec from your other's eye begin with you you can't change the other person but you can change yourself you can't change the other person but you can change yourself let me give you the r the r and the word bridge is relationship is my win relationship is my win let me explain God is a God all about relationships he's God the Father God the son God the Holy Spirit God himself he is a relational God he does everything relationally he says I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob God is all about relationships and the devil is all about destroying them make it your goal to have the best relationships you can my goal with my wife and kids is not to win the argument or disagreement is to always have relationship and I'm not perfect and I mess up but that is that is my goal always have a relationship relationship is my goal even with my friends people I work with I'm always thinking how can I communicate in a way that makes having a healthy relationship the win even when people that don't like me and I don't have a great relationship with I'm asking myself how can I put water on this relationship instead of pouring gasoline on the relationships relationship is my win and listen this is not easy it takes time I've had to learn I've had to practice what I'm going to say I've had to ask people I've had to ask my wife and then if it's something I'm talking to my wife about I gotta ask somebody with some wisdom that's not going to be like you just need to tell her off speak your mind you just need to put your foot down I need somebody's like Chris you want to have a happy home you want to have a happy wife let's think about how we're gonna have this conversation and what you're going to say because the relationship is the win the relationship the relationship relationship is my win let me give you the eye the eye initiate asking for forgiveness don't let Pride stop you from initiating forgiveness admit when you're wrong say you're sorry stop waiting for the other person oh I used to do this all the time I was pouring gasoline all over my marriage and apologizing first I'll apologize after she apologizes and then there were times we got an argument and she came to say so I am ready for you sorry no no no no no no it's too soon too soon no uh Jamie's like what in the world what is this man want I mean I was just pouring gasoline all over my marriage with my words and my tongue the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 31 and 32 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamber and and slander be put away from you along with all malice be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another as God and Christ forgave you let me give you the D the D in the word bridge is this discover where people are discover where people are your success of building a bridge in your relationship will Skyrocket if you make it a priority to discover what the other person is thinking and feeling before you begin the conversation ask yourself what is the other person's perspective what are they feeling how do I communicate in a way that will meet them where they are and listen where they are may not be right they may be wrong but it's where they are and if you're going to help them get to a different place if you want to begin to build a bridge listen you got to know where they are Proverbs 18 2 it says fools find and no pleasure in understanding but Delight in airing their own opinions fools don't want to understand what the other person is thinking and feeling they just want to air their own opinions but wise people they care about the person's perspective and feelings and they build a bridge let me give you the G in Bridge the G is this grow in my communication no matter how poor or how great at communication you are you can get better no matter how young you are or how old you are you can get better make it your goal to get better at communication come on you I hope you're taking notes you're taking notes and you're writing them down find two or three things you want to get better at go listen to this message again on the YouTube channel and take notes get better if you will improve your communication I'm telling you you will improve your relationship there were days and times my commute was poor I was pouring gasoline on my co-workers on my staff I'll pouring gasoline on my marriage my kids and let me tell you my relationships got better when my communication got better but it did not happen overnight I had to learn I had to study I had to take it to the Lord I had to do devotions on my tongue sometimes for months and months studying and praying and meditating I had to talk to other people and get wisdom so that my tongue wasn't doing damage if listen if you will improve your communication you will improve your relationship Psalm 19 14. it says may these words of my mouth in this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight Lord my rock and my redeemer James 1 26 if you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue you are fooling yourself and your religion is worthless a growing Christ follower must be growing in their communication and lastly let me give you the E the e in the word bridge is this ensure my communication aligns with the Bible ensure my communication aligns with the Bible communication will not get better if you're not biblical it will not get better if we're not biblical in the in the Book of Matthew 18 verses 15 through 17 if you read Jesus's teaching there he tells people listen if you have an issue with the person you need to go to them first and if that doesn't work then you need to bring two or three people with you and go to that person and then if that still doesn't resolve it then you go to the church and ask the church to help resolve the conflict listen so many times communication isn't working because people aren't following the biblical pattern some of you you are putting gasoline on the fire because you don't go to the person first you go to other people you talk behind people's backs you gossip and slander listen don't gossip and slender look at Proverbs 26 20 without wood a fire goes out without a gossip a quarrel dies down listen this is a word from the Lord for some of you today stop gossiping and slandering people you are burning up your relationship the fire will die down if you will stop the gossip and slandered next build people up with your communication make it your goal to build others up instead of tearing them down see some of you think it's a spiritual gift to tear people down to be negative it is not that is not a gift from the Lord Ephesians 4 29 it says do not let any everybody say any any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen be life-giving and build others up instead of Life draining and tearing them down listen we got to put down the gas can we got to put down the gasoline we got to stop pouring gasoline on the fires that are all over our relationships with our tongue and our communication just do it down well we got to put down the gasoline we gotta pick up the water hey how may I know when you see a massive fire it takes a whole lot more water to put out that fire but eventually you keep pouring water on that fire the fire will go out if you start using your wall your words to bring water I'm telling you it may take some time so it's not always just a quick I'm sorry after that just keep pouring while we keep pouring water on the fire the fire will go out here's what I want you to be be a person of peace be a person of Peace Romans 12 18 if it is possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone listen you can't always be at peace in every relationship but don't make it because of what you're doing and what you're saying I don't have peace in every relationship but I'm doing my part to have peace some people are just impossible to have peace with because of their behavior but you determined to be a person who per serves peace well at least we got to start building a bridge we gotta start using our words the tongue it has the power of life and death let's use it to be water let's use it to put out the fires let's use it to build a bridge let's use it to build people up build a bridge build a bridge how do we build a bridge you got to begin with me relationship is my win initiate asking for forgiveness discover where people are grow in my communication and ensure my communication aligns with the Bible First Peter 3 10 for the scripture says if you want to enjoy life and see many happy days who doesn't want that come on every single one of us wants to sign up for enjoying life and seeing many happy days the Bible says keep your tongue from speaking evil the quality of your communication will determine the quality of your life and relationships
b3msKKueAHg,well today we are continuing our series called winning and today i want to talk to you about winning with your habits winning with your habits our theme versus first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24. the bible says don't you realize that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize so run to win god created you to run to win not to run to lose not not to run to just just get by and then not to run just to barely make it but god created you to run to win you can win you can win you can win and last week i talked about i preached a message titled think like a winner if you missed that message please go on our youtube page watch that message i promise you it will bless you it will help your life and today i want to help you win with your habits and uh i i did some research online you know all of us have some weird and funny habits i i found a few come on how many of you save things you'll never use like you got 50 plastic bags right now underneath your sink come on you got 50 of them just sitting underneath your sink or you got random popsicle sticks or empty coffee cans or random rubber bands come on how many you got a drawer full of unmatched socks like they're there you just i don't know why but you leave them there they're unpatched i guess someday you're hoping him believing that match is gonna show up hey how many of you stare in the fridge or pantry as if food is just gonna jump out and say make me for dinner come on you you just stand there looking just believing lord if i stand here long enough and if i look long enough something yummy is going to appear hey how many of you you you you currently do this or maybe you used to do this when you were a student you cram late night for tests come on where the procrastinators at in here you're cramming late at night for those tests how many of you you don't let your food on your plate touch each other while you're eating you're like oh no i cannot do that i can come on how many of you you mix it all up you like oh stir it up and mix it all together i do this next one how many of you talk to yourself out loud yeah yeah i do that i do that from time to time or go how many of you sleep with the cover over your head anybody do that sleep with the coat yeah there's a few people first service too like hey don't bother me i'm i'm i'm in and i'm asleep how many of you sleep in a completely dark room pitch black can't i hope you don't trip all right how many of you sleep with a night light on come on how many is hey you're like jesus is the light ain't the light of the world and i'm having a light hold in my room how many of you you hit the snooze button every morning come on how many you hit here i've seen some of those people they got like 20 alarms 20 like not just one they got 20 of them so they that extra five minutes of sleep i'm sure nobody does this how many of you leave a shopping cart in the middle of the parking lot oh lord touch touch touch the saints all right how do you do this you wash your clothes and then you leave them in a basket and you let them there and they get all wrinkled until you need to pull out a shirt come on how many you do that and then you just throw it back in the dryer that's all good just throw it in the dryer for about five minutes get a whole of the wrinkles out so man these habits are funny they make us laugh but our daily habits they are critical to either winning or losing in life see success is found in our daily habits the things we do constantly and repeatedly they will make us or break us to win in life you have to create winning habits you have to create biblical habits you have to create godly habits we become what we repeatedly do and winning people are simply those with winning habits and in the book of romans the apostle paul he talks about some habits that were impacting his life look with me look with me at romans chapter 7 verse 15. paul says i don't really understand myself for i want to do what is right but i don't do it instead i do what i hate paul says i want to do right but i keep doing the very thing i don't want to do i have some he said i have some bad habits that are hindering my life let me ask you do you have any bad habits that are hindering your life what habits are keeping you from drink from from winning maybe you're getting drunk or high over and over again you keep losing your temper time and time again you keep looking at pornography day after day you keep getting into bad relationship after bad relationship you keep eating ice cream and junk food night after night you keep losing weight and picking it right back up you keep charging your credit card debt month after month charging up your credit card debt month after month you keep missing church week after week you know sometimes we can feel just like the apostle paul why do i do what i don't want to do and not do what i need to do paul went on to say this in romans 7 24 oh what a miserable person i am who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death don't you feel the same way sometimes oh what a miserable person i am why do i keep being negative to the people i love why do i keep doing the same horrible things over and over again oh what a miserable person i am i know what i should do but i don't do it how do i stop these bad habits how do i start good habits is it even possible and paul goes on to tell us a secret weapon to stopping bad habits and starting good habits look at romans 7 25 he says thank god the answer is in jesus christ our lord i want you to know that there is hope and the hope and the answer is jesus that through jesus christ and the power of the holy spirit you can stop bad habits and start some good habits that jesus christ gives us wisdom through his word in the bible to stop bad habits and to start good habits that through jesus christ there is hope you can win he's the answer you can stop bad habits and you can start good habits you can win and so let's get some wisdom from god's word on how to create winning habits i want you to write these down number one is this small start small starting small is one of those principles in god's word to stop bad habits and start good habits luke 16 10 jesus says if you are faithful in little things you will be faithful in large ones but if you are dishonest in little things you won't be honest with greater responsibility be faithful in the little things start small little matters to god listen if you will do the little things like they're big things god will help you do big things like they're little things but you have to start small look at zechariah chapter 4 verse 10 the bible says do not despise these small beginnings for the lord rejoices to see the work begin small beginnings matter to god go ahead and dream big but start small dream big but start small let me give you two important reasons to start small first is this start small so you don't get overwhelmed and never start so many people want to start big and end up never starting i'm gonna change 22 things cause it's 20 22. no you're not listen nobody can stop doing 22 bad habits at the same time nobody can start 22 good habits at the same time but many want to start big and they get overwhelmed and they never start and if you never start you'll never change you're gonna start small it says the lord rejoices to see the work begin so start small instead of trying 22 things try two two things two things and as you think about the habits you need to start i would encourage you to begin with your spiritual life see if you'll seek first god's kingdom everything else will come much easier what's spiritual happens excuse me what spiritual habits do you need to start so you can win is it daily prayer and bible maybe it's attending church every sunday maybe it's leading a small group joining a small group starting to serve on the dream team start tithing start sharing your faith what happens do you need to start or stop to be a better person what habits do you need to start or stop to be a better spouse a better parent what habits do you need to start or stop to be a better child what habits do you need to start or stop to be more healthy maybe it's eating better exercise stop smoking what habits do you need to start or stop to be more effective at work school or in sports today here's what i want you to do i want you to write down two or three things you need to stop and write down two or three things you need to start okay and then here's the second thing you need to do start small with two or three things that you wrote down so you're gonna write down about four to six things but then just start with two or three of them see so many people don't implement a new habit in their life because they begin with big change instead of small change i'm gonna work out six days a week how about you just start with three days a week i'm gonna do a hundred push-ups every day how about you start with ten every day all right i'm gonna run a marathon real soon no you're not how about you start walking a mile three days a week i'm gonna read the entire bible this year how about you start with reading a verse a day i'm gonna read one leadership book every month how about you just start with two this year me and my spouse we're gonna pray together every day how about you just start with once a week i'm not drinking any soda in 2022. how about you just start with one a day instead of four a day i'm gonna be a team leader on the dream team how about you just start with coming to church every sunday and serving on the dream team start small if you will do little things like they're big things god will help you do big things like their little things start small number two is this start with a plan start with a plan proverbs 21 5 it says careful planning put you ahead in the long run hurry and scurry puts you further behind i want to help you put together a winning plan so that you can implement some winning habits and so i'm going to give you two techniques to a winning plan the first technique is this it's called habit switching habit switching the best way to stop a bad habit is to replace it with a good habit experts call this habit switching but you need to know that habit switching wasn't first discovered by experts it was god's idea paul said jesus is the answer god's word is the answer god teaches us the importance of habit switching come on everybody say switch ephesians 4 28 it says if you are a thief quit stealing instead switch use your hands for good hard work and then give generously to others in needs god's word says switch from stealing to giving switch ephesians 4 verse 31-32 it says get rid of all bitterness rage anger harsh words and slander as well as all types of evil behavior instead switch be kind to each other tenderhearted forgiving one another just as god through christ has forgiven you god's word says switch bitterness rage and anger to forgiveness and kindness switch ephesians 5 18 and 19 it says don't be drunk with wine because that will ruin your life instead switch be filled with the holy spirit singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves and making music to the lord in your heart god said switch from spending time and addictions to spending time and god's presence this is one of the keys to getting free from addiction a bad habit listen you got to get filled with the holy spirit you got to switch come on switch from the club and party scene to the church scene switch from worldly friends to godly friends switch from your radio presets and your smartphone music being secular to christian music switch an hour of tv to an hour of game time with your family switch from using credit card purchases to only using cash for purchases switch from drinking soda to drinking flavored water switch from dating just anybody to dating christ followers switch your netflix membership to a gym membership switch smoking cigarettes to chewing gum you got to switch switch last year during prayer and fasting the lord just really convicted me and i wanted to just start losing weight and getting a little bit healthier and and so i had to make a switch because i'll be honest y'all i love cereal in the morning cinnamon toast crunch not the healthy cereal oh honey nut cheerios a big old bowl and you know sometimes i poured a little bit to milk that that just means i just need to pour a little bit more cereal after i yeah so anyway so i i made a switch in 2022 i stopped eating those sugary cereals and i switched to to oatmeal and so every morning just just a simple switch switch to bad habit for a good habit and that played a part last year i lost about 15 pounds because i had to make some switch habit switching switch a bad habit for a good habit you're like why don't you switch it for eggs i don't like eggs i had to find something i liked that was healthy and i realized praise jesus i like oatmeal even put some blueberries in them bad boys gotta make a switch make a switch number two the second technique is habit stacking habit stacking this idea comes from the book atomic habits habit stacking is where you take a new habit you want to start and you pair it with a current habit you already do it's simply attaching a new behavior you want to start with an old behavior you already do and the idea is you stack habits on top of each other so that you'll remember them more easily but once again this idea isn't new god's word teaches us this look at colossians chapter 4 verse 2 and 3. paul says devote yourselves to prayer it was a habit they they would pray and he says but listen let's stack on to your prayer time let's do it with an alert mind stack it and then a thankful heart he's stacking onto their prayer life and then pray for us too so don't just devote yours but stack it that when you're having your prayer time that's when you pray for others look at matthew chapter 28 verse 19 through 20. jesus said i want you to go and make disciples of all nations he's telling his disciples this is what i want you to do and they did it it was a habit of theirs they were going out and making disciples but it doesn't stop there he says when you go make disciples then baptize them in the name of the father son and the holy spirit stack it and then teach these new disciples to obey all the commands i have given you stack it one of the best ways to start a new habit is stack it with a habit you already do all right so i have half some are really good habits some they're not great but they're not horrible right but i'll be honest with you one of the things that's not a good habit is i do not like cardio i like lifting weights i do not like cardio i just don't like it i just like you know i'm on the elliptical and i'm like oh it's probably been about 20 minutes and i look down five minutes oh jesus i just feel like it takes forever like it's so slow and i don't like it and i'm not saying this is a good habit but i like my shows i have a habit of watching my netflix shows i got some series well guess what a show is about 30 to 45 minutes and so i'm like you know what i'm a habit stack i know i want to watch my show so i'm gonna go to the gym to watch my show and bam 45 minutes feels like five minutes habits stacking all right i i go to starbucks uh i like working from starbucks and so i like to work on sermons i like to do planning um and and so almost daily i'm at a starbucks um but i got to get my water in every day i want to be healthy i want to get my water in want to get you know i want to get at least 64 ounces if not more and i don't know about y'all but sometimes just like man just drinking water and you're not even thinking about it and you got to buy all kinds of bots and so just again it wasn't easy for me to always get my water in but starbucks will give you free water and so every time i go to starbucks i get a venti ice water every time 26 ounces y'all come on somebody and then a lot of times i'll get a refill before i leave that's another 26 ounces i found an easy way to get 52 ounces now i still got to get the rest but but but i have it and if i didn't get to refill at starbucks i go home every day it's a habit i hope it's a habit of yours too that you go home when i go home i feel that same cup and i drink it now it drives my wife crazy you got your starbucks cups i'm like it's helping me get my water in have it stacking so let me give you let me give you some ideas of habit stacking some of you you make your coffee every morning add reading your bible to all the coffee's being brewed and while you drink it come on some families they do family brunch every sunday add coming to church and then go eat brunch if you watch television it's a habit of yours when you get home from work start working out on the elliptical the treadmill or get on the floor do some sit-ups and push-ups habits stacking after you take off your work shoes immediately change into your workout clothes and go for a walk if you work at your job and there's a second or third floor of the building instead of taking the uh the elevator take the stairs habit stacking getting your steps in when you go to the grocery store i know it's a habit for some of y'all instead of trying to find the closest spot and cutting somebody off or driving around until you find one park in the farthest spot and walk to get your steps in habits stacking most of us drive to work while you're driving pray in the car listen to the bible after you sit down and eat dinner say one thing you're grateful that happened that day habit stacking after you get into bed at night give your spouse a kiss or pray together after you turn off your alarm in the morning immediately read the verse of the day after dinner on saturday evenings pray for our sunday services and the people's church staff habit stacking after church on sunday when you drive home talk over the sermon with your children after you eat dinner and clean up the kitchen read for 30 minutes when you're putting food on your plate always put the veggies on first to create winning habits you need a plan so this week start some habit switching some habit stacking and it's going to help you have winning habits so you got to start small start with a plan and then number three start with somebody start with somebody if you really want to change your life by changing your habits you need the help and accountability of others don't try to do it all by yourself ecclesiastes 4 12. it says though one may be overpowered two can defend themselves a cord of three strands is not quickly broken one of the big reasons people don't create winning habits is because they try to do it all by themselves and they get overpowered by their bad habits they get overpowered by their excuses they get overpowered by discouragement listen when you're all by yourself it's easy to get overpowered but you will create winning habits if you surround yourself with a winning team come on get you some friends to help you the bible says in hebrews 10 24 let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works to create winning habits you need some people who will motivate you to do acts of love and good works let me ask you are you on a winning team are you trying all by yourself the one of the reasons this is one of the reasons that being in a small group is so vitally important when you get in a small group you intentionally are surrounding yourself with some friends that can help you win listen this small group semester find a group that will help you win in an area of your life if you want to be more healthy get in an exercising group or start an exercising group i promise you're not the only one trying to get healthy if you want a better marriage find a marriage group or start a marriage group if you want to find a godly spouse

a group listen start with some body don't do it alone lead a group join a group winning isn't a mystery it's a result of your daily habits and you have to have the right team to win come on who's on your team get in a scroll small group number four is this you have to start and stay steady start and stay steady proverbs 19 2. it says enthusiasm without knowledge is no good haste makes mistakes let me give you some important knowledge so you can win too often people don't stop bad habits or start good habits because they get impatient and hasty people get all excited on the front end they get so enthusiastic and they're expecting immediate results but the key to changing habits is to start and stay steady results rarely happen quickly it takes time it takes staying steady if you miss a day just start the next day stay steady if you miss a week start the next week stay steady it's one day at a time one moment at a time one step at a time come on you read the entire bible one verse at a time just keep reading you run a mile one step at a time just keep walking you read a leadership book one page at a time just keep reading you get debt free one paycheck at a time just keep paying it off you get better health one workout at a time just keep working out you drink less soda one glass of water at a time just keep drinking you become a millionaire by being wise with your money and investments one day at a time just keep investing you attend church all 52 sundays one sunday at a time just keep attending you start tithing one paycheck at a time just keep tithing you graduate from high school and college one class at a time just keep studying you restore your marriage one counseling session at a time keep going to counseling you build a successful business one sale one customer at a time i want to encourage you today to just keep going don't quit don't stop keep stepping it's one moment at a time one step at a time one day at a time one week at a time keep stepping keep moving keep going folks says how are you and jamie happily married after 17 going on 18 years we just kept working we just kept working on it through the good the bad and the ugly just kept working pastor have you been a pastor for almost 17 years we just didn't quit we kept showing up every week to keep showing up have you been living with financial peace we didn't always have financial peace we had thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars worth of debt but we paid it off one paycheck at a time one month at a time that we have financial freedom because every month we tithe every month we save every month we invest pastor how'd you lose 15 pounds last year one day at a time one week at a time one month at a time took about five to six months but i started i stayed steady how do you know god in the bible i pray every day i read my bible almost my entire adult life attended church every single sunday people who win are not more special they just have winning habits your habits will make you or break you so start small start with a plan start with somebody with some friends and then start and stay steady
TaldgTSPlVI,well today we are continuing our series like Pastor Chris said miracles nothing is too hard for God and I want to talk to you for the next few moments about the the idea of the miraculous power of worship the miraculous power of worship now many people especially if you grew up in church like I did all of your life when you hear the word worship the first thing that probably comes to your mind is music now we know that worship is more than just a song We Sing it's more than just a part of a church service we experience weekly however the truth is that music is still an essential and a very important part of worship and scripture actually shows us that but how many of you know man music is a powerful thing music really I somebody felt that they're like I know it is you see music can change a person attitude can change their mood it can change their frame of mind and thankfully for people like me you don't have to be a good singer you don't have to be a phenomenal uh musician to be able to experience the power and the Influence of Music now thanks to music streaming services and Technology we're even able to build all of these different playlists to help us get ready for a moment and experience or a day how many of youall got a running playlist like okay like six of you were like really spiritual and you enjoy running like oh my goodness or a workout playlist like y'all I've got several different workout playlists I love the lift too and then some of us we got a commuting playlist that we put on on our way to work or when we're dropping the kids off at school some of us have a studying playlist which is like really impressive because I would get distracted uh trying to study and listen to music and then some of us we have a date night playlist come on somebody and it's all Jesus music too isn't it we're not going to go there today how many of you know though music is powerful enough to change the environment I mean could you imagine watching a boxing match what I what I think is so cool about boxing is how they'll bring out the first fighter like through the entrance and he's like walking through the crowd to like get into the ring and he's got his song right that they're playing behind him and he looks all intimidating you're like man that that fine business like he about to beat up on some fool and then the other guy comes out and he's just as intimidating he's coming out got his hood on over him and he's like he's jamming his music and I'm like this is going to be cool I don't even know if the fight's goingon to be good but the entrance was amazing right because the music was part of that moment could you imagine watching two guys walk out about to beat each other up and there's just no music is dead silence like what are we doing or some of could you imagine could you imagine a movie with no soundtrack now I know like they put the youth pastor up here today the Young Buck I'm 24 years old but what I tell you if this is not it's one of my favorite movies if not one or if not my favorite movie of like all time I'm not a super big musical person my wife is so because she is I've probably seen all the musicals that all you musical people are like yeah that's my jam but I think every good movie has a good soundtrack I really do and that's why one of my favorite movies if not my favorite movie of all time Rocky four that's all I'm saying somebody said oh no we won't pray for deliverance today you see man I'll throw I'm not gonna lie one of my workout playlists I was talking about earlier is the rocky Forest soundtrack how many y'all remember that scene where he's like in Russia there's like snow everywhere they can't even drive their cars and my brother is wearing a beanie a wife beater and he is just going to town working out and I'm like he I'm like we should pray for this Russian because he about to meet Rocky B boa that training montage in The Burning Heart y'all know what I'm talking about y'all seen the Rocky movie and I'm like let's go now if there was no soundtrack you'd be like this is miserable right but then he's like he's in the ring with the Russian and he's letting him have it and the whole time that music's going and I'm like that's me in the gym y'all see music is powerful could you imagine a college football game with no marching bands like my uh my my birthday is in March and my wife surprised me a while back with uh colle with h Notre Dame football tickets and so we went to uh their home opener in September I've been a Notre Dame football fan since I was nine years old and some of you like I'm so sorry Pastor I'm gonna pray for you thank you um we beat UFC so I'm I'm a happy man but we uh yeah that's right come on Frank I appreciate that so we're going to our first game I'm really excited and I like got it mapped out like we're going to get here at this time park at this time get in the stadium at this time because if I would have gone as a nine-year-old or even an 18y old I would have just been like bro let's go watch the game The Players the coaches that's what I'm here for I'm a little bit older a little bit wiser and a little more immersed in the college football and tradition I was like I've got to hear the marching man I'm like I got to hear I got to hear the players run through the tunnel and the PA guy go here come the Irish and the band's like y'all know what I'm saying so like it took forever to get through security the game tips off at 3:30 it's 3:29 and my wife and I are like we're running like Rocky B to get to our seat and finally it's like about to hit 330 and as soon as our rear ends hit the seat you hear here come the Irish and I'm like we made it yes and then every time they're scoring a touchdown people are doing push-ups and it's like great the band is going to town and I'm like like this is unbelievable I love this and so like we're playing Tennessee state so for those of you like Tennessee States a school like yes it is and uh so it's halim we're like supposed to beat these guys by 40 and like we're dominating this game so they send the marching B out there for halftime and Notre Dame comes out and I'm like man that was awesome and then it's Tennessee state's turn and the guy gets on the PA announcer and he's like and now for the best marching band in all the BCU football and I was like that's quite a claim I'm like they got to be halfway decent y'all I thought it that football stadium turned into a church when them Tennessee state folks stood up started clapping I about took my jersey off I like I'm going just have church with y'all for the next 15 minutes in this stadium and then a halftime show was over and Notre Dame won like 56 to3 but can I tell you that whole environment changed for that fan base when the music started going the marching band started playing they were like man this is a great time I'm like man I'm glad you'all had a good time coming all the way from Tennessee to get that whooping but music it's music is powerful today I want to show you how the power of worship can sometimes be the gamechanging factor for us to experience miracles in our lives in fact go with me in your Bibles to 2 Chronicles chapter 20 well I'll go back and for the different passages but that's where we'll spend the majority of our time together today but let me first provide you with some context here before we begin at this point in history uh because of sin and Rebellion the Kingdom of Israel had been divided into two kingdoms we would know uh the northern kingdom would be called Israel the southern Kingdom would be called Judah so where we're picking up in 2 Chronicles chapter 20 there were three nations that surrounded the kingdom of Judah that decided to come together join their armies together and they were going to annihilate the kingdom of Judah and so judah's King his name was King Jehosaphat when he heard this the Bible says that he was terrified that he begged and pleaded with the Lord for guidance and he actually mandated and ordered everyone in the entire Kingdom to pray and to fast why because they found themselves in an impossible situation and they desperately needed a miracle so as they're praying as they're fasting the Bible says that the spirit of the Lord Came Upon one of the men of Judah and he began to prophesy and declare the word of the Lord and this man said into the whole congregation he says people of Judah Don't Be Afraid don't be discouraged this battle is not yours but God's he says tomorrow you're going to March to the battlefield you're going to take battle positions but you're not going to do any fighting you will stand still and watch the Lord bring Victory Don't Be Afraid don't be discouraged because the Lord is with you and then the Bible says that when King Jehosaphat and the people of Judah heard this they bowed to the ground and they began to worship what I love about this is that even before the battle had been won even before the miracle happened they worshiped I want us to look at some principles in 2 Chronicles 20 regarding worship and how it releases God's miracle working power in our lives the first thing I want to show you is this number one worship is a command worship is a command in verse 18 it says then King Jehoshaphat bowed low with his face to the ground and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem did the same worshiping the Lord so as soon as king Jehosaphat heard that these armies were plotting against his kingdom it drove him to his knees before the Lord along with the rest of the people because worship was not optional for them it was essential and I think that's so important for us to understand understand that worshiping God is Not optional there should be no debate it is essential for us as followers of Jesus in fact I believe that worship and prayer should be our first response when we find ourselves in a battle you see worship is not a matter of your church background your church tradition or your style of how you like to do Church worship is a matter of obedience you see God's word it commands us in scripture to worship so when we worship God we are being obedient to his word when we do not worship God we are being disobedient to his word Psalm 956 it says come let us Bow Down and Worship let us kneel before the Lord our maker Psalm 99 ver9 it says exalt the Lord Our God and worship at his holy mountain for the Lord our God is Holy he's saying if you don't have any other reason to worship you can just worship because your God is Holy in Psalm 100 verse2 it says Worship the Lord with gladness come before him with joyful songs each of these three Psalms are so unique and so powerful because the first word at the beginning of all those verses is a direct command it is an action verb it says come it says exalt it says worship he is giving instruction he is giving a command because worship is a command church not not only were we created to worship God we're also commanded to worship God and when you find yourself needing a miracle you need to Worship in fact because King Jehosaphat understood the power of worship the Bible says he sent his singers ahead of his soldiers in the battle look at verse 21 it says after Consulting the people a king appointed singers to walk ahead of the army singing to the Lord Lord and praising him for his holy Splendor this is what they sang give thanks to the Lord his faithful love endures forever maybe you read the Bible like me a lot of times I like read something like that and I'm like my guy was probably a really solid King but a horrible general or like a horrible military strategist why are we going to take all the people with powerful voices and put them in the front line of the battle against the enemies that got every single weapon you could possibly think of it is going to be a blood bath but you see Jehosaphat and the people of Judah understood that there is Miracle working power in worship and I think sometimes we have to learn how to send our worship ahead of the battle sometimes we have to send our worship ahead of the problem ahead of the challenge some of you are facing battles with your children you're facing battles in your marriage you're facing battles in your health you see whatever battle you might be facing in your life today you you need to send worship ahead of it come on can we just take 10 seconds right now and can we send worship ahead of whatever battle we're facing because we give God the praise and the glory in the middle of the battle you see what happens when we send worship ahead of the battle yes worship is a command but what happens when we send worship ahead of the battle well number two is this worship creates an atmosphere for the miraculous creates an atmosphere for the miraculous you see worship creates an atmosphere where God shows up and when God shows up miracles happen look at verse 22 it says at the very moment at the very moment they begin to sing and give praise the Lord caused the armies of Ammon Moab and mount seir to start fighting among themselves the Bible says at the very moment they begin to worship was the very moment God showed up to work you see when you begin to worship God begins to work at the very moment you begin to worship God can shift the atmosphere completely in your situation and what I love about God is that it doesn't matter if you're in a church building if you're in your house if you're in your car if you're at your job or if you're at school if it's your marriage your children at the very moment you begin to worship the SP spirit of God will show up in an instant and the atmosphere will begin to change you see worship it creates an atmosphere where God shows up it also creates an atmosphere where God shows off verse 22 we read it at the very moment they began to praise and worship and sing it says that the Lord showed up and he began to work Israel didn't have to fight just as God said why because he turned the enemies against one another he began to work he began to demonstrate his power his presence and His glory the Bible says when as they worshiped God demonstrated his presence and his power and sometimes some of the most powerful moments we can encounter the manifestation of God's presence and God's power is when we worship I remember perhaps one of the most heavy one of the heaviest and most difficult seasons of my life during that time I was very discouraged even a little hopeless and feeling defeated about where I was my season of life and where I was going into the future and I remember one day getting into my car and instead of listening to a podcast a sermon uh sports radio local news I just remember plugging my phone into the car and going to Spotify and whichever worship playlist popped up first I just hit Shuffle on that one like I was just not in the mood for any particular song I was just like whatever's going to play is going to play and as I'm sitting there in that car and I and I hit Shuffle on that playlist there's a good old gospel song from 1997 that came on by Kurt Franklin and God's Property some me all about the bus out and have Revival I said Kurt Franklin and I remember as that song began to play it said you don't have to worry and don't you be afraid Joy comes in the morning troubles don't last always for there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears way and if your heart is broken just lift your hands and say I know that I can make it I know that I can stand no matter what may come my way my life is in your hands with Jesus I can take it with him I know I can stand no matter what may come my way my life is is in your hands y'all like that so I'm G give you the second verse too says so when tests and trials may seem to get you down and all your friends and your loved ones are nowhere to be found remember there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away and if your heart is broken just lift your hands and say and I just remember we under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the presence of God just flooding into that vehicle I lifted my hands right there balling like a baby and I said I know that I can make it I know that I can stand no matter what comes my way God I know my life is in your hands I don't know what the future holds but I know that I know that I know you hold my future and with Jesus I can take it with him I know I can stand and no matter what comes my way my life is in your hands let me tell you the atmosphere didn't just changed in that car that day but the atmosphere begin to change in my situation because it was worship that paved the way for the presence of God to show up and bring a miracle it's our worship that clears the way for God to move and it's a moment of worship that will set a miracle into motion see worship creates an atmosphere where God shows off his power and His glory in worship it creates an atmosphere where the enemy is shut down y'all ever remember seeing those I can't remember the company but like the JJ wat commercials where he's like hey Grandma nice to see you shut you down like like that's what I think about when we worship and it shuts the enemy down in verse 23 it says that the enemies of Moab and Ammon turned against their allies from Mount seir and killed every one of them them after they destroyed the army of seir they began attacking each other so when the army of Judah arrived at the Lookout Point in the wilderness all they saw were dead bodies lying on the ground as far as they could see and not a single one of the enemy had Escape church I believe that so many people sadly and unfortunately miss out on God working in their life simply because they do not worship we get so busy trying to work our way out that we miss worshiping our way out some of you get so busy trying to work your way out of a battle you miss out on worshipping your way out of a battle and worshiping your way to a miracle you see God will fight your battles for you if you will learn to worship your way out you see some of us we keep trying to fight battles in our lives that only our worship was intended to win I love what Psalm 82 says it says through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the Foe and the Avenger you see when the enemy says that you should be depressed it's worship that can bring joy when the enemy says that you should be worried you should be anxious it's worship that can bring peace when the enemy says that you should be afraid it's worship that can bring Faith when the enemy says that you should be bitter it's worship that can bring gratitude when the enemy says you should be jealous you should be bitter it's worship that brings healing when the enemy says that you should give up it's worship that brings hope you see some of you I wish y'all help me Preach Today some of you man your battles were not meant to be worked out but with worship If your battle's going to be won it won't always be with work but sometimes it's with worship see worship creates an atmosphere where the enemy is shut down and worship also creates an atmosphere for Freedom the Bible says that the people of Judah witnessed the Lord defeat their enemies and it prevented them from falling into captivity and enslavement like they had done previously throughout their history you see God's people experienced Freedom that very day and that very moment because of God's miraculous power and it was their worship that served as the key to their freedom and maybe some of you need freedom in your life today some of you need to be set free from an enemy some of you need to be set free from an addiction some of you need to be set free from fear from worry anxiety or depression you see when you worship you are literally inviting the presence and the power of God to set you free Paul WR wrote this in 2 Corinthians 3:17 for the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom you know the Bible also says that God inhabits the Praises of Israel he inhabits the Praises of his people people and the picture I like to read scripture in terms of like thinking about it in pictures the picture I get is that the lion is the king of the jungle he inhabits that jungle are you think about some of the greatest sea creatures that God created to dwell in the ocean what do they do they inhabit that body of water they inhabit that space the Bible says that God literally inhabits he dwells and he lives he rests in the Praises of his people and I don't know about you but I don't want a rock crying out in the very place where I was created to give him glory and to give him worship I want him to inhabit my marriage I want him to inhabit my bank account I want him to inhabit my career and I have to worship because he inhabits the Praises of his people you see I believe some of you today walked into this building in bondage but you're going to walk out being free indeed today in Jesus name because where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom verses 25 through 26 worship creates an atmosphere for provision worship creates an atmosphere for pro provision this is awesome verse 25 says King Jehoshaphat and his men went out to gather the plunder they found vast amounts of equipment clothing and other valuables more than they could carry there was so much plunder that it took them three days just to collect it oh y'all this is like my wife when she goes to Target like hey there's not enough space in the car not enough resources not enough time we got to make another trip right that's how blessed they were on the fourth day it says they gathered in the valley of blessing which God its name that day because the people praise and thank the Lord there and it is still called the valley of blessing to this day man I love that because the Bible says that the people of Judah they were marching to a place the valley of war the valley of Bloodshed the valley of violence and the valley of death but because God showed up and moved and performed a miracle there it was immediately renamed to the valley of blessing it doesn't matter what you are going through today because we serve a God who can turn the valley you are walking through right now into a valley of blessing but you have to remain committed to worship him through the battle and through the valley sometimes God's miraculous power is just on the other side of your worship and sometimes you have to worship your your way to a breakthrough and lastly number three worship must be continuous must be continuous you see not only is it important to worship God before the miracle comes but we also can't lose our worship after God brings the miracle in verse 27 it says then all the men returned to Jerusalem with Jehosaphat leading them Overjoyed that the Lord had given them victory over their enemies they marched into Jerusalem to the music of harps lears and trumpets and they proceeded to the Temple of the Lord so the Bible says that they they worship before the battle during the battle and after the battle because their worship was continuous see the power of worship is not about a one-time visitation it's not a one andone it's not I'll do it when I need it or when I feel like it no we are created to live a NeverEnding lifestyle of worship to our God I love what Hebrews chapter 13 verse1 15 says it says that through Jesus there let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise the fruit of lips that openly profess his name Psalm 341 he says I will bless the Lord at all times before the battle during the battle after the battle when the miracle comes or before it comes his praise shall continually be in my mouth and then Psalm 718 says my mouth is filled with your praise declaring your Splendor all day day long church if you will live a life of worship then you will live a life of Miracles if you'll live a life of worship you will open the doorway for God to move and to do miracles in your life but worship must be continuous it can't just be 15 20 minutes on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night that won't do it it's what you should do every single day let me give you these before we pray don't let the battle Ste your your worship see some of you you're tired you're weary from fighting one battle after the next after the next after the next you've been fighting for a long time and you're like Pastor I'm exhausted you can't allow the battle to steal your worship you have to keep worshiping God even in the middle of the battle don't let people steal your Worship in 2 Chronicles 20 people were part of the problem it was these kingdoms Ammon Moab mount seir but they never occupied judah's mind God did you see they worshiped God in spite of people and I believe there's some of us here today who aren't worshiping because we have allowed people to occupy the space in our life that should only be reserved for God Almighty himself you see worship will always shift your perspective from people to God don't let people steal your worship don't let Pride steal your worship worship is all about surrender they could have fought the Battle their own way but instead they invited God into the battle with worship Church you cannot have control and worship at the same time you have to surrender control surrender your pride and worship God don't let feelings steal your Worship in this battle the people of Judah they had to make a choice not to allow their feelings of fear confusion uncertainty to to defeat their faith and take their worship some of you you have allowed how you feel or how you don't feel to rob you of your worship but there are blessings you can only experience on the other side of worship don't let your feelings dictate your worship press past your feelings and worship no matter what and then lastly don't let success steal your worship even after God destroyed their enemies what I love is in the beginning of the chapter it says that when they heard they heard the news that the battle was coming they bowed down down and they worship and then God turns their enemies against one another in Victory comes and what did they do they did what they did before they fell down they bowed low and they begin to worship unfortunately I've seen too many people in my young life allow success to distract them and take their worship from them friend don't let your education rob you of your worship don't let how much money's in the bank dictate your worship don't let your career don't let success steal your worship because God is always worthy to be worshiped you cannot allow success to get in the way of that come on how many of you know God is worthy to be praised and we are called to give him our highest praise because he is worthy of all of our praise in a few moments we're going to worship God together today and what I'm believing is that as we provide this to worship we're going to invite the presence of God to join us in the battlefield I believeing we're going to see Miracles great throughs healing Victory and freedom today in Jesus name
XHiUmuVb_D4,well as you can see my beautiful bride Jamie is here and uh we're gonna be tag team preaching today y'all got my better half up here to help me bring the word and so we're excited to share God's word with you in this series um has been all about relationships and why relationships are not working and I really really encourage you to be here every single Sunday I believe if you'll be here every Sunday your relationships will get better now I don't know about you but when I was in elementary school my favorite class was recess anybody else out there anybody else my favorite class was recess going outside playing basketball kickball freeze tag come on anybody play tetherball I wasn't even sure how that worked but any tetherball folk you'll have to explain it to me later but I was I was probably shooting Hoops but I loved recess and and one game that was a lot of fun was called Red Rover how many I remember Red Rover any anybody remember Red Rover Red Rover Red Rover send Jerome on over and so it if you did not have the blessing of playing Red Rover as a child I will explain to you what you missed out on and so you had two teams all right and the two teams would get in a line and they would stand opposing one another maybe 20 yards away from each other and so Jamie's going to help me illustrate here and so on your team you were holding hands and you would choose somebody from the other team and and so you would and you would pick one and you would say Red Rover Red Rover send Jimmy on over okay and so what Jimmy had to do is he would he would look and he would try to find the weakest link he would try to find the weakest spot because his goal was to run as fast as he could through the arms of of two people holding their hands together he would try to run through all right and your job was to stop him and here's what happened if Jimmy ran and you held your arms together and you held up Jimmy Jimmy now joins your team but if Jimmy runs through and breaks through your hands Jimmy then gets to take one of your teammates you would normally pick one of the biggest and strongest and take them back on to his team and so that's how Red Rover worked it was a it was a lot of fun and the devil plays Red Rover yeah he's always sending a bunch of mess on over he's always looking for a weak place to separate to break through the devil loves to separate first Peter 5 8 it says stay alert watch out for your great enemy the devil he prowls around like a roaring lion he is looking for someone to devour he is looking for the weak spot he is looking to to cause division see the enemy is looking to devour relationships he's looking to bring separation he's a divider he loves to divide Nations and divide cities he loves to divide Christians and divide churches he wants to divide friendships and divide families and to divide siblings to divide parents and children and divide marriages the devil is searching for the weak spots in our relationships our families marriage so that he can divide and separate see the devil is a divider but our all-powerful God is a uniter the Devil is a separator but God joins people together amen and so today we're going to talk about marriage why marriage is not working single folks don't tune me out you want to take really really good notes and so Mark chapter 10 verse 7 through 9. it says for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be United to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what God has joined together let no one separate God joined Jamie and me together on May 15 2004 we became one flesh and the Bible says he who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord and there's been favor on our lives simply because God joined us together and listen God joined you and your spouse together and you may not even recognize it but there's a favor on your life because of your union so don't let anyone separate what God has joined together don't let a man a woman a child a problem a trial a demon separate you and your spouse don't let the enemy stop the Divine favor on your life after 18 years of marriage 18 years of ministry we've been on staff at People's Church 15 years now Jamie and I we have identified some of the most common schemes the enemy uses to stop marriages from working to divide and separate marriages yeah the first way marriages aren't working but can work is number one unresolved conflict separates marriages healthy communication joins marriages Ephesians 4 26 27 says in your anger do not sin do not let the sun go down while you are still angry and do not give the devil a foothold when we have unresolved anger conflict Strife in our marriage we give the devil a foothold and the devil will use anything that's unresolved in your marriage to drive a wedge between you and your spouse many times Chris and I have had conflict I mean we argue quite often about a lot of different things because we're just so Polar Opposites I mean we've we've argued over our marriage we've argued over kids we've argued over our money we've argued over intimacy we've argued over our personalities and how we're so different we've argued over his driving we've argued over my driving pray for us pray for us none of us wants to give the other person control um I argue with him when he doesn't give me enough compliments on the fact that I made a delicious dinner I ate it all I mean I'm I'm like the plate is empty but I've learned it no no that's not enough but if he hums while he eats that's how I know it's actually really good that's how you know you've been married for a while but we we even argue sometimes we're on our way to a date night we're like where do you want to go I don't know where do you want to go will you pick no you pick well I don't feel like picking like we'll even argue where to go to a date y'all we even argued over how to write this message last night Lord help us I was like you preached that he's like you could preach that I was like fine I appreciate he's like well you want me to preach I'm like oh you're driving me crazy here's the deal though at the end of the day you're going to experience conflict in marriage you are and it might be over small things like not taking out the trash or not picking up their socks again off the floor but at the end of the day you're not talking about me why y'all laughing I'll be laughing at yourselves I was surprised about how many people left at that first service we got a lot of sock layers in here in all seriousness though there are some couples in here today it's much bigger than that you've experienced betrayal maybe your spouse has lied maybe you feel completely overlooked or underappreciated there is conflict in every marriage but author Max Lucado says that conflict is inevitable but combat is optional we're combative when we choose to be Reckless with our words Proverbs 12 18 says the words of the Reckless they pierce like swords but the tongue of the wise brings healing did you know that in regards to your words and actions there's a study that actually shows a five to one ratio of negative to positive words and actions so for example let's say you do something that really hurts your spouse you said a mean word or did something spiteful you now then have to do five positive thoughtful things to make up for the deep emotional impact that negative thing had one of the reasons your marriage might not be working today is because maybe the negative to positive ratio is way out of balance your words matter your words can separate but they can also join you together yeah they can healthy communication joins your marriage together and so I want to share with you what healthy communication is what what it looks like first is this be honest Ephesians 4 15 it says instead speaking the truth in love you have to speak the truth to bring your marriage together so you can be emotional and not be truthful you can be real and not be truthful being truthful requires being vulnerable sharing your struggles sharing your pain sharing your disappointments sharing your lack of trust sharing your desired expectations you can't bring your marriage together with uncommunicated expectations be truthful and be honest Ephesians 4 25 it says therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor for we're all members of one body and today some of you you're divided because you aren't truthful with your spot with your spouse you're frustrated they aren't meeting your needs but you aren't communicating your needs your spouse is guessing they're trying to read your mind I used to do this with Jamie like I literally thought she should be able to read my mind she should know my needs I shouldn't have to explain it and tell it to her and so literally I was expecting her to read my mind and all it did was create more conflict and more problems and more challenges because she's not a very good mind reader nor did God create her to be a mind reader and I realize man that is unfair for me to expect Jamie to continue to just be reading my mind I have to communicate and now some of you you're being honest but it's from a place of unhealth and so what you does what you desire is unrealistic your your spouse can't meet your needs because it's unattainable see you got to be honest secondly be honoring be honoring what does that look like well first be loving Ephesians 4 15 instead speak the truth in love it says we will grow to become in every respect a mature body of him who is the head that is Christ you are mature in Christ and in your relationship by speaking the truth in love and so you got to be loving secondly by your tongue Ephesians 4 29 it says do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth see being honest doesn't mean you say everything you think okay because some of what you want to say is what the Bible would call unwholesome [Music] I call it you acting a fool you can't say everything you're thinking and honor your spouse in marriage some of you you need to be quiet you talk too much you say too much you need to practice self-control you're you're hurting your marriage you're not helping your marriage and I did a lot of damage with my words in our marriage I wasn't thinking about like words don't mean a whole lot to me and I wasn't thinking about how my words mean how they made Jamie feel but words mean a lot to her and so I was tearing her apart I was cutting her down with with my words and I was doing a lot of damage and there were things that I did not need to say I could have kept to myself so you gotta you gotta bite your tongue uh next be a builder Ephesians 4 29 it says do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen we got to use our words to build up not tear down that's being honoring be kind if you 4 32 it says be kind and compassionate to one another some of you you're unkind and you're wondering why your marriage isn't working and it's because you're being a jerk and you're like well Pastor I'm just being honest yes and you're being a jerk you're being mean you're hateful you're sharp you're condescending gotta be a be a builder of our words next be a unifier and Peacemaker Ephesians 4 3 it says make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of Peace which do you value more being right or having peace what do you value more being writer having peace you can be right and be miserable you can win an argument and be unhappy you can be right and the devil is still separating your marriage you have to Value having unity and peace in your marriage and harm home or you'll be right and miserable right and separated he'll be right and divided yeah the second reason that marriages aren't working but can work is number two selfishness separates marriage but serving joins marriages marriages aren't working when selfishness creates a me versus a we mentality maybe you're listening and you're thinking well how would I know if I have a me mentality well here are a few examples if you prioritize your needs and your wants before thinking about your spouse's needs and wants then you have a me mentality if you make decisions without your spouse or without considering how it can affect your spouse and their needs and wants then you have a me mentality if all you care about is your spouse understanding what you think and you feel and your perspective and you don't care about how they think they feel their perspective you have a me mentality the only thing that you care about is your spouse hearing you and hearing your thoughts and being heard rather than you listening you have a me mentality if your marriage is all about you seeking your own good then you have a me mentality First Corinthians 10 24 says no one should seek their own good but the good of others marriages aren't working when selfishness creates a consumer relationship when spouses are asking themselves questions like why don't they make me happy what have they done for me lately why don't they change maybe they're focused on their spouse meeting their needs doing what they want when they want it when we focus on our own good and what our spouse is doing for us and that's all we focus on then we have turned our beautiful marriage into a consumer transactional relationship and we are missing out on Mutual connection a deeper intimacy and reciprocating love yeah marriages also aren't working when selfishness creates a you're the problem mentality Matthew chapter 7 verse three through five Jesus said why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye in our most difficult season of marriage I increased our Separation by fixating on everything I thought Jamie did and was doing wrong it was all her fault I mean if she would just get right and do the right thing we would be good I I had deceived and believed myself into believing that I wouldn't be struggling if if Jamie was different I if if this hadn't happened I wouldn't be like this if she would change this I would be better and I had a big old plank in my eye and I I failed to acknowledge my own faults my own mistakes the way I was hurting Jamie when Jamie would share with me some of my issues I just thought she just needs to get over it and again I needed help y'all I needed help but we both needed help and but what happened is I couldn't experience healing in my heart and in my marriage until I was willing to take the plank out of my eye man I I got some issues I got some things it's not all on her but again it did damage to uh our marriage because I had a you're the problem mentality and so how can you make your marriage work better you know because it's it's it's really easy to put on the mask I've got a picture uh from 2011. Jamie and I were at a Colts game together and look we're just smiling looking like we're in love but uh this was one of the hardest years of our marriage uh we're smiling but we weren't very happy we didn't really like each other we were fighting um a lot and this was seven years into our marriage really where it kind of hit some rock bottom we were both being selfish and so I want to share with you some shifts that we had to make and I believe if you want your marriage to work better you can make these shifts and and they will help you out number one is this is you have to shift from a fleshly perspective to a Biblical perspective First Corinthians 13 5 it says love is not self-seeking but most marriages are self-seeking it's all about my wants my needs my desires my happiness my pleasure my perspective my feelings Philippians 2 3 through 4 it says do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit rather in humility value others above yourselves not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interest of others First Corinthians 10 24 it says no one should seek their own good but the good of others our marriages will improve when two people are focused on outserving each other instead of out selfishing each other second thing is you gotta shift from trying to change your spouse to changing yourself some of you are so focused on trying to change your spouse you're like me you can't see the log in your own eye you have to stop putting all your energy into changing your spouse and start changing yourself if you change it may Inspire your spouse to change this was a game changer for us and we had to go to a counselor to figure it out because we were focused on changing each other and the moment we shifted know that no matter what Jamie does I'm gonna change and Jamie shifted and said you know what no matter what Chris does I'm Gonna Change let me tell you we had a breakthrough yeah when we got our eyes off each other and our eyes on ourselves and what we can do when we when we made that shift it was a game changer for our marriage thirdly shift from you need to understand me to I need to understand you this was a game changer well we were great at talking we were not very good at listening because we had to create some space and again counseling helped with that we needed a third party and that's okay thank God for counselors and but when we started to listen to one another creative space where I was really listening to Jamie and and her needs and her feelings and she was able to do that for me um it it it it it did some wonders in our marriage number four you got to shift from what makes me happy to what makes you happy we're going to out serve our spouse not out selfish and the number five shift from how you should serve me to how I can serve you serving your spouse looks like meeting their needs honoring them helping them participating in things they enjoy ask your spouse how you could serve them better don't guess a lot of folks are guessing Jamie and I were guessing Oh I thought I was killing it y'all oh yeah I'm a great husband no I wouldn't know I was killing our marriage that was going on guessing you know when I started to really ask I was like ew ooh okay and it was it was a game changer yeah and with that something that um I read in a small group curriculum and it really helped us and even me was I encourage you when you leave today ask your spouse to write down the three things you do that makes them feel the most loved you may be surprised when I did this for Chris the stuff he wrote down was not what I was doing and so it was eye-opening for me because I was doing so much only to realize those things didn't even fill his love tank so it really helped me kind of focus and re-prioritize so I hope that's helpful for you guys the third reason that marriages aren't working but can work is number three indifference separates marriages and investment joins marriages marriages aren't working because so many people find themselves just existing in their marriage they live as roommates there's no passion it's just kind of the day-to-day taking care of the kids doing the normal stuff but the deep intimate connection isn't there it's just a going through the motions maybe you've even had the thought of well my marriage just it is what it is you know I can remember a time when I felt very much like that before we went to counseling I loved Chris I wanted to stay married but I had completely lost hope that our marriage would really ever get any better and that may be where you're at today and I want to encourage you we are living examples that your marriage can become better you can feel like your marriage is alive again and you might not feel motivated to invest today in your marriage just based off of what you've been through but I want to encourage you with this Rick Warren says feelings follow action it is easier to act your way into a feeling than to feel your way into an action do what you know you should do and allow God to do the rest because taking action will join you and your spouse together one of the best things that Chris and I did when we were in that really really tough spot is we just kept on investing in our marriage we just kept going on those date nights even though there were some dates we didn't really want to talk to each other we just kept dating we kept doing it every single week we kept talking you know as I started to open up and share my real feelings my truthful feelings and as he opened up and shared his feelings those conversations were not fun they were hard but we just kept talking and with that came so much healing we kept working on our marriage even today marriage is a little bit of work every single day keep working on your marriage some of you you want a miracle but you're not giving the Lord anything to work with would you take action today would you begin investing in your marriage today start doing the things you used to do when you dated start doing the things you used to do before you became indifferent and I promise you if you do you will begin to see God transform your marriage yeah Revelation chapter 2 verse four and five it says yet I hold this against you you have forsaken the love you had at first consider how far you have fallen repent and do the things you did at first start investing in your marriage you put in the work it I promise you it will work it will get better and so I want to give you some ways you can start investing in your marriage come on start dating with your spouse do whatever it's work every week we still got to work to find the child care and what day and what night and what time so that we can go on a date but we make sure we go on a date almost every single week so just start dating start every other week and then move to every week listen give your spouse your undivided time and attention and talk a listening ear with no distraction ask your spouse how they're doing in life listen and then ask more ask them what you can do better and listen ask them what their fears are and listen ask them what they're dreaming about and listen uh give your spouse a safe place to be honest real and vulnerable without judgment come on give your spouse compliments what do you appreciate about them come on be specific man I thank you for taking out the trash two months ago that really blessed me it blessed me give your spouse the love they desire not just the love you feel comfortable giving than them go learn their Love Languages read the five love languages learn their any engram their personality type give your spouse Grace start overlooking the little things you've been complaining about no one is perfect forgive your spouse give your spouse affection give your spouse sex pray together go on a three to seven day trip with no kids talk and plan have fun but work on your marriage get on the same page get a marriage plan get a money plan a intimacy plan a kid plan a rest plan a dating plan a communication plan there's been a few times in my life where God has just spoken so clearly and I remember one time God was like Chris Ministry you just spend so much time planning and praying and strategizing how much time are you spending that on your marriage [Music] oh convicted gotta spend time planning strategizing praying for my marriage Mark 10 verse 7-9 for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be United to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what God has joined together let no one separate don't let unresolved conflict selfishness and indifference or the devil separate what God has joined together let's pray
bfEv5GZ59To,let's get started we can continue with the fifth week of our series called speed kills how many of you this Series has blessed you so far if you've been amen I know it has impacted my life thankful for pastor Herbert Pastor Chris just communicating the truth of scripture and both irrelevant and practical way but if you're new or catching up on the series what we've basically covered up to this point is that we live in a fast-paced world that seems to just be getting more chaotic and more stressful by the moment if you talk to somebody it seems like everybody and their grandma or everybody in their Grandma's dog is busy with something if you know what I'm saying you know busy with school busy with work busy at home with the kids busy trying to pay the bills and on and on it goes right and so that's why for the last few weeks we've just pushed pause we've been slowing down to study and learn how it's our Pace in life that actually affects the peace we experience in our life and so you see the enemy the devil our adversary he knows that high speeds ultimately lead to Great crashes and so that's why he tries to use an unhealthy Pace to his advantage and so that's why he works so hard to try to distract God's people from God's purpose he wants to destroy unity in our homes and our marriages and our families and it all starts with our speed and our pace and how we lead our lives every day as followers of Jesus you know the Bible says that in John 10 10 the that the devil the thief is what Jesus called him the thief comes to steal kill and destroy but Jesus said I came so that you can have life and life to the full another translation says life more abundantly and so we understand from what Jesus has already made us aware of that the devil wants nothing more than for us to conform to the ways of our fast-paced culture that wears busy like it's a badge of honor like it's something to be proud of that or lead us to believe the lie that if our schedules are crazy we must be important or that our activity equals productivity which isn't true but you see if we'll slow down long enough and take a real honest look at our lives we'll realize that it's not being too it's being too busy rather that will break us not bless us and you see like we learned from scripture the devil wants to keep us busy so that he can break us he wants to steal kill and destroy but God wants to break the busyness off of our lives so that we can experience freedom and blessing because ultimately the enemy understands that if we fail to intentionally take time to slow and understand that busyness will wreck our lives but God wants us to understand it so that we can be blessed how many of you you've ever been driving somewhere trying to get to a particular destination and then somewhere somehow along the way you ended up somewhere completely different than what you planned before I know I'm not the only one in here I'm a holler back preacher so you can raise your hand shot me down like this God love her I love my wife but I'm praying for it because she this happens to her a lot so what ends up happening is she'll tell me hey babe I'm gonna be gone for a couple hours I'm meeting with so and so for coffee I'll be home when I get back how am I praise the Lord God bless your ministry so she goes out gets coffee and I'm like man she picking coffee for a minute like they have in worship prayer and a message like they having church or something and then she gets back with all these bags and I'm like what could you have possibly bought at a and then I look at the back tags and I'm like homegirl then the target she been the Trader Joe's I'm like listen I said y'all pray for our bank account like no I'm just playing but priorities but I'm like girl you said you were going here how did you end up over here along I'm like somewhere along the way we either miscommunicated you took a wrong turn I'm like as the first time I'm like man she accidentally ended up in the Target parking lot but I'm like the third or fourth time I'm like okay something's up here but you see with all seriousness it's really really sad whenever that happens in real life whenever we decide we have a goal we have a dream and a vision from God that this is where I want to be a year from now or five years from now this is what I want my marriage to look like this is what I want my health to look like this is what I want my relationship with God to look like and then it's like when you get there you're you end up like I what happened like did I take a wrong turn somewhere because I'm not where I thought I would be eventually what happens is where we end up is often very different from where we actually go and I want you to know today if you plan to live the life God has for you to succeed and to experience blessing instead of Brokenness it's not just going to happen by chance because what happens if you're driving down the road and you let go of the steering wheel you won't end up at your destination you'll drift and you'll wreck and you will crash and the same is true of your life you see Satan will always try to put in his best effort to distract you and throw you off course he wants to steal your focus to keep you busy doing all of the wrong things and sometimes it's not even I'm trying to tempt you to sin or do things that are wrong sometimes he just wants you to misprioritize good things over great things it's easy to fall into the devil's trap because he can be so tricky at getting us to prioritize things that aren't bad but aren't the things that God tells us when we put first when we prioritize first will lead to freedom and blessing in our lives and so in order to stay the course and not end up at the wrong destination we need to establish some convictions in our lives or what what we call priorities that will guide us and keep us on track and so simply that's what I want to talk to you about today is our priorities and the title of today's message is first things first first things first you see a priority is something that is considered more important than other things in existence within a specific context and so we all have priorities things that are more important than others that may look differently from somebody else's we all have priorities whether we realize it or not and priorities are powerful because they ultimately determine the direction and the course of our lives in other words your path is being driven by your priorities and you get to choose watch this you get to choose your priorities but it's your priorities that ultimately choose your path and so ultimately we when we lose sight of what our priorities should be we don't end up where we thought we would be and we don't get understand the disconnect that it all starts with our priorities we need to remember the devil wants to break us but God wants to bless us and to experience God's blessing we need to follow God's path because the problem I run into with a lot of people so many of us want to experience the blessing of God with that apart from following his path which is a completely different sermon for another day so I am not going to preach on that I'll put a pin in it how about that but what I want you to understand today is that God thankfully will never leave you guessing or wondering what that path is for you because he specifically and clearly Maps it out in his word and so today I want to draw your attention to the passage of scripture in Matthew chapter 6 where Jesus touched on the power of priorities in the sermon on the mountain so I'm going to begin Matthew chapter 6 verse 25 here's what the Bible says Jesus said therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more than food and the body more than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in Barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them and you are you not much more valuable than they can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life y'all when God asks a question he's not looking for information just so you know verse 28 Jesus continued and why do you worry about clothes see how the flowers of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his Splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how God closed the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things in your heavenly father he knows that you need them but here's what verse 33 says but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well you know I find it fascinating that Jesus was directly speaking to the issue of worrying about the wrong things in our everyday lives not bad things because how many of y'all know what you eat what you wear is important and Jesus even said hey your father knows this but these certainly aren't the things that matters most that you should be concerned about or worried about you see what we worry about what I think Jesus was helping us understand was that what we are worried about is not only attached to where our faith is but it's also attached to where our priorities are so in other words what you're worrying about tells me a lot about where you put your faith and where you lack Faith what you worry about tells me what's important to you and what may not be important to you and so when it comes to our priorities I just want to Simply Challenge and encourage you today with four quick takeaways to implement and practice and doing this it will not only protect you from falling into the enemy's speed trap because remember speed kills but it will also position yourself to experience peace and to maintain a healthy balance and margin in your life and so here's the first takeaway about our priorities number one is this you need to know your priorities you need to know your priorities many people honestly do not know what their priorities are because they truly haven't given it much thought there are people who think they know what their priorities are but they really don't know what their priorities are you see when we when it comes to priorities if you've asked the maybe the average person what their priorities are they may sputter out something like faith family and football or if you're from Indiana basketball right which hopefully never mind I'm not going to get into the Colts right now thank God they won't lose today but when it comes to priorities when it's like man I don't really know what my priorities are or I think I do what should they be you know the Bible actually has a lot to say about priorities I love what Jesus said in Luke chapter 12 verse 34 he says that for where your treasure is there your heart will be also think about the idea of treasure Jesus essentially said whatever is valuable and important to you remember a priority is something of high importance in your life Jesus is saying where your treasure is where your value is where your priority is is where you will find the desires of your heart remember that it's your priorities that guide your path and so if you don't know your priorities then you won't know your path you can hope you can guess you'll make the best educated guess that you possibly can but at this point it's wishful thinking and God doesn't want you to play a guessing game when it comes to your life and when it comes to your priorities because if you don't know your path then it's impossible to know where you're going to land how many of you know always I pray none of us in this room today would ever take this approach when it comes to taking a trip or a family vacation we know where we want to go but how we're going to get there is a mystery right if my family we try to take a trip every year together in the last trip we took was to was to St George Utah we got to see different areas and we had never been there before so we needed to know what is the path to get there what flight are we taking when do we need to get there or if you're driving to somewhere like Tennessee or Florida you probably need a GPS or if you're not going to do a GPS get old school get a map right because what vacation planning for a vacation y'all are stressful enough like growing up with three siblings a family of six like we're at each other's throats before we even get everything loaded up in the van or the rental if you know what I'm saying like I'm just being transparent with y'all and so it helps whenever you know this is where we want to go this is how we're going to get there and the same is true for your priorities you need to identify them and know what they are but once you know your priorities number two here's what you need to do second takeaway is this number two you need to live by your priorities led by your priorities I say that because there's a lot of people that say their priority is one thing but their life does not reflect that y'all ever met somebody who said like health and fitness is their priority and you could take one look at them and think man I don't know did you start last week like I love like when I was in college and I just started getting in to weight lifting and I was going probably five days a week and I would run into some old College friends and they would be like yeah man I'm in here uh man grinding putting in the work in and I'm like man why don't we see you on Mondays at Planet Fitness and I don't see y'all Planet Fitness I don't know what it is but pray for my salvation and my patience because like Monday it's it's jam-packed every single day but then you don't see everybody the rest of the week I'm like man must not be that big of a priority then or you look at somebody who verbally says this is my priority my family is my priority but then they don't spend time with their family they don't have meals together or they say prayer is their priority but maybe they haven't prayed in two or three weeks and there's there's no condemnation no judgment that's I'm not being mean or anything like that but Jesus touches on this in scripture because he wants to help us that's his heart for us you know if we're follower of Jesus we would say that likely God is our priority but a true priority is not really based on what you believe it's based on your behavior is what the Bible tells us notice what Jesus said one chapter later in Matthew chapter 7. he's warning his uh his disciples about false prophets those who would oppose them in this church verse 15 he said Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves so in other words he's saying hey there's a group of people that say this is who they are what they're about this is their priority but then when you look at their actions this is who they really are verse 16 you can identify them by their fruit that is by the way they act can you pick grapes from Thorn bushes or figs from thistles a good tree produces good fruit and a bad tree produces bad fruit a good tree can't produce bad fruit and a bad tree can't produce good fruit some of y'all probably thinking Jesus this is common sense where are you going with this but verse 19 here's what he says every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire and then verse 20 here's the home run right here yes just as you can identify a tree by its fruit so you can identify people by their actions in other words Jesus is saying you can identify somebody's life by their behavior you can identify it by their fruit you can identify it by their priorities so what is the best way to know that God is really the first priority in your life where do you spend your time where do you spend your money where do you spend your energy where do you spend your talents because I think what a lot of us run into is I want you to think of this this vase as your life you know we've talked about in this series trying to come up with other words when people ask us how we're doing oh I'm busy right everyone's been trying to find a substitute for that word but a lot of times we feel like man I don't have if I only had more time if I only had more energy if I only had more money if I had a better job and we begin to try to like fill in the blank with all these excuses about the condition of our lives but if you think about this life and what you're putting into it you know sometimes we can get focused on all the little things that just tend to add up right like we got to get our kids from one place to another we have to make sure the grocery shopping gets done that that everybody in the house is eating we got to make sure that everybody's ready for school we got to make sure that the bills are paid we got to make sure that we're spending time with uh with our friends or that we're you know get into that place we need to be and we begin to fill up our life with all these little things that we don't really think are going to take up that much of our time in our energy but we could just begin to think about these little things like Jesus even said it's it's what you eat it's what you wear that you're worried about and it begins to fill up our lives and we're like man that kind of took up I don't know how much room or how much margin I have in my life to give to God like the bigger priorities in my life but I'll try my best now that I've got this weekly checklist done and I've met these goals let me try to you know now I can spend time in God's word oh Lord this is going to be challenged uh maybe I can you know try to I mean I'm going to try to pray more read my Bible man oh church is Sunday oh I'm scheduled to serve on First Impressions this week or PC kids or man Pastor asked me to lead a small group or oh man we forgot the time oh man how am I gonna tide this week we made that Dream Builders commitment to give above the tide there's no way I could possibly try to fit all this in my life and we get so overwhelmed we get so frustrated we stress ourselves out trying to thank God how am I supposed to accomplish all these things and do all these things without burning myself out without being worried without being stressed without wanting to quit and throw in the towel all together but Jesus touched on this in his word in Matthew 6 Jesus is like you you got it all wrong you're so worried and focused on the little things first that in Matthew 6 33 notice what Jesus said Jesus said what we have to do is we have to rearrange our priorities as followers of Jesus we're not of this world this Earth is not our home we're living for eternity we serve a king we are a part of a kingdom and so what we have to do is we have to seek his kingdom first God I'm gonna be in your word no matter what it's a conviction it's a priority God I'm gonna spend time in prayer I'm going to pray with my wife I'm gonna pray over our kids you know what I've never done it before but I'm going to start fasting 21 days of prayer this January but leaving for breakthrough in my life gonna see blessings I haven't seen before because I'm doing something that I've never done God you know what I know I committed the time but I'm going to try to give above the time now I need to be in a small group because I need Community I shouldn't be doing life alone because we're better together I'm going to make God's house a priority I don't care what time the Colts are playing I don't care what's going on you know they're coming from a Colts fan come on that's why we got a 9 30 service praise the Lord but God I'm going to put you first you know what God I don't know how all these other little things that matter are going to fall into place like yeah I should go to the gym yeah I should eat right yeah I need to go to the store I need to pay these bills but God I'm going to trust that putting you first making you the first priority God like you said everything else will be given to me God everything else will be added I tried it my way before I couldn't make it fit I couldn't make it happen I was getting burned out and stressed out but God now that you're first I know you're doing what I can't do myself God I couldn't fit I tried to move things around but ultimately what happened was I didn't need more time I didn't need more in energy I didn't need a better job what I needed was better priorities you see when you put God first it all comes together I'm worried I'm going to make a mess y'all but hey sometimes life is messy you see but when you do it God's way I hope you all are good in this like something incredible happens a breakthrough happens when you do life God's way when you put the kingdom first when you put his presence first your finances fall into place your marriage falls into place it all comes together because whatever it is y'all this is why I believe in tithing this is why I believe in prayer all these spiritual disciplines because what you give God first will be blessed I know a lot of people got money in the bank and who don't tithe then they're not blessed I know a lot of people who are healthy physically but spiritually and mentally and emotionally they're not healthy because they haven't given it to God first People's Church whatever you give God first whatever becomes your highest priority the big rocks in your life that you give to him are blessed and you don't have to worry about what you can't control or all these little things that Rob us of our joy Rob us of our peace and our margin because what you give to God will fall into place you seek his kingdom first everything else will be added and so let me ask you this today what are the big rocks in your life what do you need to give to God first so look at the problem for a lot of us is that there are big rocks in our lives that shouldn't be big rocks it should be the sand and then vice versa but you see our priorities they can be difficult and sticking to them can seem impossible but can I tell you working hard at the wrong things in life is tragic it only leads to disasters you will wear yourself out we need to be reminded of what the Bible says in Psalm 37 4 that when we Delight ourselves in the Lord he gives us the desires of our heart don't get so caught up in the God's going to give me the desires of my heart that you miss that there's a condition you have to delight yourself in the Lord that God no matter what my priority my joy and my peace is in my relationship with you it's the foundation it is first in my life God I'll trust you and believe in you for other things but the thing that matters most is you and so we need to live by our priorities and thirdly third thing we need to do we don't just need the lit by our priorities we need to guard them here's what the Bible tells us when it comes to keeping first things first proverbs 4 23 says above all else so most importantly this is a priority Above All Else guard your hearts for everything you do flows from it the New Living Translation it says guard your heart above all else for it determines the course of your life you need to remember that Jesus said your treasure what's important to you your priorities are where the desires of your heart will be and that's why it says we have to guard our hearts we have to guard our priorities because there's only so much you can do and there's so much you need to do and that you want to do and there are so many good things that are fighting for your time they're fighting for your energy they're fighting for your commitment but the most important things tend to go whenever our priorities fall out of alignment that's where we drift into destruction our lives but you see what we need to do we need to guard the big rocks in our lives the Trap happens whenever we say yes to things that aren't or shouldn't be our priority because every time we say yes to something whether we realize it or not we're saying no to something else and it's not taking us down a path we want to go what are some of the big rocks that tend to fall to the Wayside whenever our priorities drift well number one it's our time with God our time with God is always the first to go I'll never forget being an intern in youth ministry when I was in college going on this uh this summer camp trip with my youth pastor and he's doing this round table with all these youth pastors he's got this National influence an incredible leader and I'm like man what are these guys going to ask him like he's just a gold mine he's ready to drop bombs on him and I was baffled at all these guys from 20 years old 30 years old 40 years old in youth ministry are asking my youth pastor how do you lead a successful thriving growing Ministry and a healthy family doing all of that how are you able to have time to spend time reading your Bible praying and getting closer to Jesus I remember like grabbing a hold of him afterwards and I'm like dude pastors literally struggle to do those things in Ministry and he was like it's so true the Trap that lot of people can fall into a substituting Ministry for the relationship with Jesus that's a huge trap the devil tries to get people to fall into he's saying it ha like your time with Jesus it has to be a conviction and a priority that until I do this I'm not going to be able to do anything else Ian bounce said that hurry is the enemy of prayer we have this feeling I'm too busy to pray but what about I'm too busy to not pray that's what Martin Luther said he said I'm so busy now that if I did not spend three hours each day in prayer I could not get through the entire day and I know this probably seems unrelatable in 2022 because the Lord knows that different pace of life back then but the principle is true nonetheless because if anyone was busy it was Martin Luther he was leading a spiritual Revolution preaching writing pastoring he was translating the entire Bible into German he was a dad he was a husband he was incredibly and overwhelmingly busy but what made the difference in his life he was able to do all those things because prayer was one of the big rocks that came first in his life he started there and it affected everything else in his life another thing that tends to go is time with our family it's easy to sacrifice whenever we feel rushed when we're blitzed and hurried by the busyness of life but church family it's our dinner times it's our family meetings it's prayer and worship with our our children that we never get those days back you see no one else is tasked with the responsibility of raising your children that's why we have to be focused we have to be disciplined we must be relentless whenever the enemy tries to distract those things distract us from those things and can I tell you don't just guard your priorities just to guard your priorities like I love what Tim Tebow once said he said I'm not a huge fan of being disciplined just to say that I'm disciplined I don't work hard just to tell people I'm a hard worker he said I have a dream a goal and a vision that is big enough and worthy enough for me to be disciplined for I may ask the same truth God wants us to have priorities because he has a vision a blessing and a dream for our life that far outweighs and is far greater than anything else in our lives and so one of the ways we can guard the big rocks in our lives is saying no whenever we're tempted to enroll our kid in a fourth sport they're not Bo Jackson maybe they are no when you're tempted to eat out two nights a week when you committed to only doing one no it's a priority it's a conviction when you're on a health journey and you're tempted to add a dessert at the end of the meal no signing up for that new credit card no when you when you've worked out a budget with your spouse but it's on sale no we need it no we don't but I want it no come on you know it could be tempting we see a better idea might be our priority is to save so that we can give more our priority is to get healthy so we can be better parents to our kids we can be better leaders at work you see we need to guard our priorities and then number four last thing we need to do is this and we'll pray is we need to evaluate our priorities we need to evaluate our priorities Jesus said in Matthew 22 when he was asked what's the greatest commandment in the law verse 37 Jesus replied love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment Jesus is saying there's a lot of important things you could do but here's what's most important it's loving God and loving people your relationship with Jesus is the most important thing that you give to anyone in life to your kids to your boss your co-workers to your family your friends your church your team you know what's interesting is that when Jesus said this there were 613 Commandments in the Jewish law and Jesus is basically saying all that summed up into love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself but can I tell you that even this one commandment seems so demanding because how many of you like me can honestly go to bed at night with your head on the pillow and think man you know what today every moment of today I love God with all of my heart I loved God with all my soul I loved people like Jesus did I loved people more or just like I loved myself you see God first that's just not something cute that you put on your Instagram bio and then your feeds say something completely different what God first means is that he's first in every area of your life and there's fruit for it there's evidence so maybe the series has been helping you a lot I want you to know that it wouldn't be a winner a takeaway for you to say well I better slow down Pastor Andrew said he needs to start saying no so I should probably miss church every other week resigned from the Dream Team change up small group once a month you see you you need margin in your life you need to put the big rocks in first you need the priorities and you need to live by them so you can experience what God has for you I'll give you this last verse and we'll pray together it's in Joshua 24 15. he's the leader of Israel and they've come to a place of transition where a lot of people are trying to figure out where their priorities are which God they want to serve who they want to worship or they want to go and I love Joshua's response verse 15 he says if serving the lord seems undesirable to you if you don't want to choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your ancestors sir beyond the Euphrates or the gods of the amorites whose land you're living and I love this part he says that's for me and my household we will serve the Lord you know when you look at your priorities where you're spending your time your money and your relationships are you on track to where you want to go because some of us when we look at our priorities maybe we're met with the reality there's some things that need to change so that we can live the way God has called us to live I want you to know today I don't know what your priorities are I don't know what you've been wrestling with during this series but today's the day you have an opportunity to make a decision you know what like Joshua said y'all can go off and do what you want to do you can serve whoever you want to serve you have your priorities but let me tell you what my priority is as for me and my house we will serve the Lord we're going to pray together as a family 21 days of prayer we're going to be there we're going to fast together we're going to be in God's house every time the doors are open why because we want to experience the blessing God has called us to live we want the freedom and their protection so today maybe you need to be honest you need to be courageous and be willing to make necessary changes and say and God has for me in my life me and my family most importantly above everything else we're going to serve you and only you
W7ptUMsTl_w,good morning People's Church it's always good to be with you um I have this weird thing that happens in my brain where I can take just about any conversation I'm in and my brain can connect it to a song lyric or a movie quote anyone ever do this you have this problem I do this to my wife all the time right she'll like I literally was doing it backstage like as he was saying hey we're adding this forth service so we can make room I'm like I will make room for you like it's just like in my head all the time is there's a musical I live out every day um so what's really interesting is uh when Chris said hey I want you to speak in our angels and and demons series he said angels and the first thing that came in my mind was a scene from the old Disney movie The Emperor's New Groove anyone ever seen that movie I have a picture for you uh right here Kon um if you remember in the movie like all of a sudden like he's like oh shoulder Angels right and um that's what I think of when we talk about angels for whatever reason that's what my mind goes to um We're not gonna we're not going to keep it like goofy we're going to be really serious about what scripture says about angels but I just yeah just wanted to get that out of the way so thank you for letting me do that I don't know what comes to your mind when you think about angels whether it's like Harps robes you know Halos like you halo let's see right there but we've been in a series talking about angels and today I want to talk about how Angels do unbelievable things for people so before we do that let's review briefly where we have been the last couple weeks so what we learned is that there are different types of angels with different roles we have seraphim cherubim archangels for example we even learned that sometimes Angels speak to people and throughout the Bible you have Angels speaking to people for various reasons they give encouragement they give someone words to speak they encourage people to not be afraid they give instruction or Direction they deliver a promise from God or they help people experience salvation but Angels don't just speak to people they're also actively doing things for people and all throughout the Bible angels are obeying the will of God so we're going to go through a lot of scripture today so if you're following along just you know whether you take a picture of the slide or you take notes we're going to be in a lot of scripture today because I just want to kind of lay out this argument for you so in Psalm 103: 20 it says praise the Lord you Angels you mighty ones who carry out his plans listening for each of his commands what we learn is that Angels carry out God's plans and they listen to his commands they don't do anything against God's will nor will they lead you to do anything against God's Will and and they're always reflecting back to Jesus or to the father or to Holy Spirit like it's always like uh they don't accept praise for themselves they deflect it right back to the Trinity today I want you to understand that a big part of God's will is for angels to help and serve people to do good things for you and to draw your attention to God letting you know how much he loves you you start to see this in Hebrews 1:14 it says are not all Angels ministering Spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation you see in this passage that angels are servants serving those who will inherit salvation they do good things for people and I want you to see some of the good things they do for people and be encouraged because what they did for people in the Bible they still can do for all of us today it's not like that stuff stopped as a matter of fact like sometimes where we get into trouble is we see some things in scripture and we say that's cool for that time but probably not for today and and the truth is there's a lot of it that is still alive and active today so remember as has been said the last two weeks any of us could encounter an angel and not even know it Hebrews 13:2 do not forget to show Hospitality to strangers for by doing so some people have shown Hospitality to Angels without even knowing it so it's a pretty cool thought when you think about it but with that being said here's what I want to talk about today I want to give you eight good things that Angels do for God's people eight good things that Angels do for God's people so the first one is this they can protect us throughout scripture we see God using angels to protect his people from harm this is evidence in the story of Daniel being thrown in the Lion's Den Daniel 6:22 it says my God sent his Angel and he shut the the mouths of the Lions they have not hurt me because I was found innocent in his sight nor have I done any wrong before you your majesty after God brought the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt he told them he would protect them with an angel in Exodus 23:20 see I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared listen to how the psalmist puts it in Psalm 91 11-12 for he will command his angels concerning you to to guard you in all your ways they will lift up you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against the stone this is also a call back in Jesus's Temptation when the enemy is saying oh you remember this verse this is why you should be able to do these things I'm asking you to do but many many years ago when I was about six years old I experienced this firsthand so me and my sister we we grew up in a really small house actually in the Northeast and um at that time I was about six Jamie would have been probably four uh we were being babysat and our dining room kitchen was like tiny it was like all in one space so if you sat at the head of the table the stove was maybe just a couple feet away and we were sitting there and Jam's eating SpaghettiOs and I'm waiting on our babysitter to make french fries and as she's cooking these french fries on this gas range some of the hot oil spills over the pan and it hits the flame and it causes it to shoot up and catches her hand on fire now she screams to pull her and pull her hand back when I hear her scream sitting at the head of the table I turn to my left to see what the screaming is about now the thing is when she pulled her hand away she actually never let go of the handle of the pan so she rips her hand back and all of that hot grease comes flying and it catches me on the left side of my body and my face within moments through multiple layers of clothing I now have second and third degree burns all over the left side of my body and on my face now grew up in church and I had always been told when when things happen and you need you need intervention you just cry out to God so at six how many of you know I think when Jesus says to come to him with the faith of a child like we just we don't have time to get in a theological headspace about issues does that make sense so at 6 when that happens I shot up and I just started screaming Jesus Heal me Jesus Heal me Jesus heal I just knew I was in the most amount of pain I'd ever felt even to this day at 43 years old I can remember how painful that was I've never experienced pain like that in my life I'm screaming Jesus heal me I run to the bathroom to jump into the bathtub and turn on the cold water and I'm trying to put my body under the the water as it's coming out my baby said at the time she calls 9911 she's in a panic her her the Flesh on her hand is melted and she is now responsible for the six-year-old child who is screaming in pain and so when she calls 911 she just says there was an accident we are burned it's on Armor Street and she hangs up the phone and now imagine like in Indianapolis if you had an accident okay I don't know if any of you from the East side but it's where I'm from that's what I know and someone was to say hey there's an accident there's someone's burned it's on Mid Hofer it's a lot of houses to sort through right and I you know today I would think that they can just like tell where the phone call came from immediately I don't know what it was like in the early 80s for technology but I just know she didn't give them the address she runs into the bathroom because she's trying to help and she's taking water and she's trying to Splash it on my body but the truth is this is an oilbased burn so we're just hitting it with water and it's just spreading I don't know any different I'm six so at that time this man comes walking right into our bathroom looks like a just a regular almost like construction worker if you will he had work boots blue jeans a white T-shirt blonde hair beard ball cap and he grabs my babysitter on each arm and she tells the story she says thee second he grabbed me I felt an overwhelming sense of Peace run through my body and he said ' here's what you need to do I need you to calm down take a breath we're going to grab towels we're going to soak them with cold water and then we're going to surround the burn sights with these towels and no sooner does he say that he just disappeared he didn't physically walk out of the bathroom he just said what he said and then he vanished no sooner does he vanish the paramedics show up to my house I mean from when the call was made to when the paramedics showed up talking minutes and they didn't even they weren't even given the address they come in they start treating me put me on the stretcher they take me to the E I'm sitting in the ER and my back is just covered in hundreds of blisters the ER dock just starts cutting through the blisters and I'm not I'm not ah like and he was like do you feel this and I said yeah it feels like when I go to get a haircut and the Loose Hair just falls down my back and he's looking at the nurses he's like he should be in a lot of pain and the truth is through that experience and skin grafting surgery and all of that I never once at six years old would put on a painkiller I just didn't feel pain and that's if any of you have ever burned anything you know that's not normal and it's not because the nerves are damaged and I couldn't like I can even where my skin graphs are now like I can still feel there's nerve endings under there I can still feel things I believe with my whole heart that a six-year-old child in a moment of pain screamed out to his Heavenly Father for help and he sent an angel to take care of what I needed amen and and that stuff happens you know like like I I tell people there's there's things you can believe you can read your Bible and say this is what I believe you could be dogmatic but then when you have an experience what do you do with an experience so people can saywell Angels don't do that I just know this guy came in told us what to do and then disappeared that's all I know and then I didn't feel any more pain after that so you can you can argue ideas but when someone has an experience you'll never convince them otherwise amen amen so second thing that Angels do for people is they physically direct us last week it was talked about how Angels gave lot and his family Direction by telling them to leave Sodom and Gomorrah before it was destroyed but they didn't just direct them verbally they also directed them physically check this out in Genesis 1915-16 with the coming of dawn the Angels urged lot saying hurry take your wife and your two daughters who are here or you will be swept away when the city is punished when he hesitated the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city for the Lord was merciful to them in this passage it seems that angels can even direct us physically like like as as he did for my babysitter he grabbed her to help calm her down say this is what you need to do right number three they can rescue Us in Acts 12 verses 1-4 King Herod arrested people from the church and he was planning to persecute them he also had James the brother of John killed then he decided to arrest Peter with the intention of persecuting him and possibly even killing him and I want to pick up this story in verse 7 after Peter's been arrested says this suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light Shone in the cell he struck Peter on the side and woke him up quick get up he said and the chains fell off Peter's wrists then the angel said to him put on your clothes and sandles and Peter did so wrap your cloak around you and follow me and the angel told him again we see an angel directing one of God's people here verse 9 Peter followed him out of the prison but he had no idea that what the Angel was doing was really happening he thought he was seeing a vision they passed the first and second guards and came to the Iron Gate leading to the city it opened for them by itself and they went through it when they had walked the length of one street suddenly the angel left him then Peter came to himself and said now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his Angel and rescued me from herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen see Peter was Shackled In a jail cell because of his faith and witness about God and yet God sent an angel to rescue him and God can send angels to rescue his people truthfully there has probably been plenty of times when God has sent angels to rescue us and we didn't even know it because the scripture says in Hebrews that sometimes we entertain angels unaware like they've come into your life they've come in contact with you and you don't even know it I mean what about the time that you didn't die in the car wreck what about the time where oh I'm running late but because you ran late you missed the accident you with me this morning how many things happen in your life that you see God's hand of protection and you weren't even aware the time you did survive in the hospital right these things that could have been worse but they were not the things that miraculously happened that you weren't aw of I I have a a friend who's a pastor and he was saying that there was a Revival had broken out in his church and during that time he had felt spiritually attacked so strongly because there was amazing things happening at his church like one day he's coming to church and he's having a hard time even getting to the to the parking lot of his church because there's all of these 18-wheelers that have pulled onto the side of the road clogging up a lane with their hazard lights on and just row by roll just all of these 18 wheelers he's like what is happening and then he finally gets around and he gets into the parking lot of his church and he sees bodies just laying in the lawn of the church face down and he's like what is going on and he walks up and he touches one of the people says what's happening he says we're all the drivers of these trucks we were driving by the church when all of us heard an audible voice that says I am the Lord God who knows you and cares for you come and serve me and he said the only thing we knew to do was to just jump out of our trucks and run to the church but none of us could even make it in the building we fell face down just worshiping Jesus that's Revival people right but this pastor friend of mine he said during that time you know the enemy doesn't want that stuff to happen so there was a lot of spiritual attack and he's driving he passers in Fort Wayne and as he's driving into Fort Wayne he was praying in his car and he says he says Lord please protect me send your angels to guide me and protect me as as all of these things are happening and he says right then and there the Lord said open your eyes and he said he opens his eyes are open and he sees on the the front of both sides of his vehicle Angels flying as he's driving and the Lord says you're protected like this stuff is um it's unreal except it is real like I know a lot of us we hear something like really but we serve a supernatural God why would he not work supernaturally so he can rescue Us number four they can provide for us there's a story in First Kings 19 where we learned that Elijah was tired he was thirsty he was hungry he was depressed he was even suicidal and God sent an angel to provide for his needs in First Kings 19 4-8 it says while he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness he came to a broom Bush sat down under it and prayed that he might die I have had enough Lord he said take my life I am no better than my ancestors then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep all at once an angel touched him and said get up and eat he looked around and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water he ate and drank and then lay down again the angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said getet up and eat for the journey is too much for you so he got up and ate and drank strengthened by that food he traveled 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Horeb the Mountain of God at Elijah's lowest point God sent an angel to provide for his needs Elijah was hungry he was thirsty he needed nourishment so God sent an angel and I and I don't know what that food was like but listen if it was me I would just say Lord can you just bring me those Texas Roadhouse rolls and that cinnamon butter Lord cuz I don't care who you are how many of you know them rolls are good right come on people getting excited about that man that's why listen that's why you got to come to first service like you get to lunch early right Texas Roadhouse rolls amen hallelujah it's probably not what it was but you can imagine like again my mind the way it works when I think about that I'm like yeah if that was Elijah like Lord that would have been awesome just rolls right so good number five they can strengthen us when Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane he knew he was about to die a horrific death on the cross so he was praying intense prayers he was wrestling in prayer and the Bible says he was sweating drops of blood he was exhausted he was depleted and God the Father sent an angel to strengthen him look at this in Luke 22:43 an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him Jesus was exhausted he was depleted and the angel came and gave Jesus a blast of energy he helped Jesus recharge his batteries when Jesus couldn't depend on his disciples and friends God sent an angel to empower recharge and impart strength to him and God can send angels to strengthen you when you are weary have you ever been exhausted or depleted like Beyond tired have you ever been there before just got nothing left feels like you have nothing left to give you're running on empty and then another problem hits you hard in those times be encouraged because God knows every need you have and how to strengthen you he's probably already at work in ways that you don't see or know but he's there and those times leaning to God pressing to him tighter than you ever have and know that he is with you and he is for you and that is good news y'all that the God of all of the universe is for you amen number six they can perform Supernatural Feats let me quickly show you several times in the Bible where Angels perform Supernatural Feats again uh we read from Luke 22:43 an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him that was Jesus they have this Supernatural ability to strengthen people when they need it I'm not sure how that works but it does Daniel 6:22 my God sent his Angel and he shut the mouths of the Lions which is very Supernatural they have not hurt me because I was found innocent in his sight nor have I ever done any wrong before you your majesty acts 121-11 they passed the first and second guards and came to the Iron Gate leading to the city it opened for them by itself that's Supernatural and they went through it they walked the length of one street suddenly the angel left him then Peter came to himself and said now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his Angel and rescued me from her as clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen Matthew 28:2 there was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it very Supernatural Revelation 20: 1-3 and I saw an angel coming down out of Heaven having the key to the abyss and holding in his hand a great chain he seized the dragon the ancient serpent who is the devil or Satan and bound him for a thousand years he threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the Nations anymore until the thousand years were ended after that he must be set free for a short time God has given Angels the ability to do Supernatural Feats they are able to do things that we cannot and the good news is a lot of those things they are doing are for our benefit amen number 7 they can fight spiritual battles on your behalf Daniel 10: 12-13 then he said don't be afraid Daniel since the first day you began to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God your request has been heard in heaven and I have come in answer to your prayer but for 21 days the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way then Michael one of the archangels came to help me and I left him there with the spirit Prince of the kingdom of Persia In this passage we can see that there are spiritual battles happening in places and around people that we're not even aware of I want to to show you this in two other places and I want to share with you a story Jude n but even the Archangel Michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said the Lord rebuke you and in 2 Kings 6 the king of Aram sent a great Army to surround the city this Army was in a position to defeat God's people and then a servant woke up and saw the city surrounded by the Army and cried to Elisha the prophet he says what are we going to do now cuz he's look and he sees the whole entire city surrounded by this Army and he's like what are we going to do like they are going to take our lives the servant thought it was over because they were surrounded and they could never win and then I want you to see what Elisha says to him in in 2 Kings 6:1 16-17 he says don't be afraid for there are more on our side than there are on theirs then Elisha prayed oh Lord open his eyes and let him see the Lord opened the young man's eyes and when he looked up he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and Chariots of Fire I want you to check this out the servant's eyes were open to the reality of the spiritual realm and he saw angels of God present and ready to protect God's people so one of the things that that is said in Jewish tradition is that in the Garden of Eden When sin and destruction enters into the world that the the veil between the Unseen in the seen realm drops and so now it's not so easy to see because back when Adam and Eve before sin they walked with God in the cool of the garden every day so there was no Veil like the Unseen realm was there in their lives but after the fall this is not so clear but every once in a while there's these glimpses in scripture like in here in 2 Kings where it's like Elisha could have said Lord would you remove the veil and then for the for a moment in time he gets to see what's happening in the Supernatural world in the natural world you understand he sees all these angels so let me explain how this happened in my father-in-law's life so my father-in-law before he ever became a Christian he was raised in a cult and in this particular cult they would they would do things like try and speak to evil spirits and channel energies and all like really dark stuff but when you've opened your life to that kind of way of seeing things you're more sensitive to the supernatural do you understand right and so since God redeeming all of that stuff in his life my father-in-law has been way more sensitive to the supernatural even on on Jesus's sight of things so there was one time he was at his house and he just felt compelled to start to pray for his family he says Gabe you need he just here here's the spirit speaking he said Gabe you need to pray for protection for your family and so he just begins to pray and he begins to pray and and as he's praying about like protection for his kids and his wife and everything he says Josh it's like the Lord opened my eyes and what I saw was surrounding our house shoulder toosh shoulder was these seven foot tall Garrison of angels all holding Spears and Shields and Lord's like you are protected but then he said but then I felt compelled to pray even more so for for his two kids who one of them is my wife now and so he walks in and he says and I just began to pray for Dany and Dustin and as I'm praying for them Lord protect them would you just keep them safe he says I can see literally descending through the ceiling in a in a circle a smaller circle of angels just like the ones outside but that they're coming literally through the ceiling and they just land on the ground and they're over Dany and her brother Dustin to keep keep them safe now here's a thing that a lot of you probably don't know about my wife multiple times in her life I feel like the enemy has tried to take her out at Birth Danny was born at 21 weeks old that's extreme preey she was a pound her dad says like she fit in his hand and an absolute miracle that she's even even alive she had heart issues she had to have open heart surgery get all of that fixed later on in life developed a rare kidney disorder that like tried to take her out and then all of a sudden had a miraculous healing through that like she has been prayed over to be protected and my father-in-law has these stories of like seeing literally Angels saying we've got her she's she's in God's hands again you can have thoughts you can you can think things theologically we can dive deep into what you believe about angels and demons whatever I'm just telling you these are the experiences of myself and people I know and love and trust this stuff is real God cares enough about you to send angels to protect you and and so it almost like with a verse that says like greater is he that lives in me than he that is in this world I mean it's not just that you have the Holy Spirit living inside of you to guide you and protect you but then you add Angels surrounding you as well listen we are a protected people now that doesn't mean that nothing bad will happen in our life as a matter of fact maybe one of the most dangerous things that has ever been taught is that because you're a child of God you'll never have pain or suffering like that's just not true if anyone says like you're going to be free from all of that like what do you do with Jesus like he suffered the Son of God so we were never promised to never have suffering we were promised we will never walk through it alone he will guide us he will help us he will strengthen us right amen so the truth is people are are prone when it comes to this stuff to to swing their beliefs let me just say this people are prone to swing the pendulum we as Humanity we swing the pendulum to extremes and so one of the extremes we swing it to is that everything is a spiritual attack and that's not just that's not true not everything is a spiritual attack listen if you're on the worship team and you show up and all of a sudden you plug in your guitar and it's not working like it's not for you to look at Marcus and be like well the enemy's just attacking us this morning no you just got a bad cable replace the cable it'll be fine right not everything is a spiritual attack right microphone's like it's the Enemy No it's batteries just change the batteries right but what we do is we then swing the pendulum to the other side and we say nothing is a spiritual attack that there's no Supernatural and that also is an error an equal extreme because the truth is some things are attacks so let me share with you this story I I took a group of our KY Alfa students on a mission trip we went to Inner City Chicago and I don't know if you knew this or not but um Chicago has like a multi-level Road system in the city and so there's literally roads that are under the city and it's crazy when you juxtapose some of the opulence and wealth in downtown and right below it on the roads is thousands of homeless communities and so we took our students and we we ministered to the homeless there and there was one man he came up and we were serving food and giving out blankets and stuff to keep people warm one of the men came out here and we just said hey can we pray for you and the second we said that he was like uh uh oh man I feel like I don't understand what you're saying we're like pray we just want to pray for you he's like man I I H and we said okay you know what we're just going to pray and so we laid hands on him and we prayed and immediately something started to take hold of his body he started violently shaking and throwing up and he was like stop stop praying and we're like no we need to pray all the more because we knew something dark was happening and I don't know where you're at with all this but personally I believe like I said like stuff we read about in scripture is common for today I believe that about all of the gifts of the Holy Spirit and I believe that even about speaking in tongues and so some of our group who who have that gift we we started praying in tongues and the second we did did that he he looked at us and he said what language is that stop it and we said no we're just going to do it all the more and we did and finally it was so painful for him that he pushed away and he looked at all of us and he threatened that he was going to kill all of us they walked away and I and we just looked at our group and we said hey we're going to jump back on our bus and we're just going to continue to pray and we contined to pray and I prayed in the spirit cuz I didn't know what else to do right and minutes go by and he comes back and all of a sudden we're dealing with a different person he's in his right mind and he was grateful and he said thank you for praying for me like it was a different person right and so again experience you can say like ah I just really don't believe in this this stuff well I can tell you you're not going to convince me that's true I've just seen too much does that make sense seen things you can't explain and I've seen it on both sides but here's what I want to tell you God always wins out like and I think we need to understand that because sometimes when we tell stories we tell these stories in a way that we almost glorify the dark part of it like how powerful it is like oh my gosh it was so strong and it was yeah but God won right so he's always the stronger one amen so the truth is that it's probably somewhere in the middle like not everything is the enemy and and it's not that nothing is the enemy like he's at work and so we just need to realize though that that God and through his angels he's at work more often than we realize number eight the angels are with Jesus when he returns for his people 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet call of God and the dead in Christ will rise first this verse says that the Archangel will be with Jesus when he returns for his people here is what I here's where I want to close with this message today the truth is there's a lot of Brokenness in this world I mean you just have to just look around there's Injustice there's inequality there's disease there's pain but the hope of the church and when I say the church I mean all Christians for all time the hope of the church for thousands of years has been that one day Jesus is going to come back and fix all this mess I mean it's laced throughout your Bible this is what people are looking forward to that one day this place that we call Earth will look exactly like heaven again cuz like the plan was Eden that's where we started and the plan is to be eeden again like that's where the Lord wants to take this place and you see this right in Jesus's prayer that we call the Lord's Prayer he says father your kingdom come your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven like Jesus is praying for this place to look like that place right and so he's going to come back but until he does he's given us the job of doing everything we can to make this place look more like heaven as a matter of fact the church was supposed to be functioning in a way that we are the trailer to the feature film like when people are like what is heaven going to be like it looks like something happening right here it looks like people from different backgrounds different color different cultures not choosing themselves over another but choosing others over themselves it looks like like people that would never on their own choose to be family to become family like that's what heaven is like and so when we live this out we are making Earth more like heaven we are aligning with what Jesus was praying you understand we're like we're we're in sync with Jesus and that's an awesome thought but the truth is that sometimes we we get so bound up by the things that are happening in our world the things that are happening to us personally or to those that we love that we can't ever even feel like there is hope sometimes we lose hope and and Jesus coming back right you're like I've heard Jesus has been coming back my whole life I don't know is it really happening and listen I just want you to understand Jesus makes it really clear why he hasn't come back yet Peter says this I think you mentioned this in prayer he says don't consider slowness like the way you think about it because to him a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like a day like to us this is long to him it's a blink and he says but he's patient not wanting anyone to perish but all to come to everlasting life here's the truth for those of you that found Jesus a couple years ago aren't you glad he didn't come back yet CU you found him in that window and so there's people that surround you and he hasn't come back yet yes we want him to fix all this mess but we also want him to redeem those that don't know right that's what this is about
TSuiwwE_Dak,well we're continuing this series called good God that God is good even when life is hard and the title of my message today is I don't trust God or the church I don't trust God or the church our key verse for this series is Psalm 34 Verse 8. it says taste and see that the Lord is good when we were living in Oklahoma a friend of ours said I would like to take you and Jamie out to dinner it's our treat well honey I know it's a blessing when someone says it's their treat all right and so we uh they're like we'll pick you up and so they come and they pick us up and they bring us to this restaurant called mahogany it is probably one of the nicest steakhouses in Oklahoma City and we're like oh man you guys didn't no no it's cool we're like well you have to do you so we're already you know we're man I can't believe he's taking us to Mahogany and so we go into the restaurant now I think there are two types of people in this world when someone says they're going to take you out to eat and they're going to treat you there are those that are like hey they paying come on somebody I'm gonna get an appetizer an entree and a dessert you know what I mean we're the hundred dollar steak at and then there's those other folks that are like man they're paying I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go too hard in the paint I want to be respectful and I don't want them to be like oh man I'm never taking them out to eat again and uh I would say David I would be more on that side of of the coin you know we're like okay where's kind of that that Medium you know we don't want to order too much because again this is I mean you're looking at this you ever been one of those restaurants where it's like it's like all a la carte you mean like you mean like I don't get no fries with this steak or baked potato oh no oh that's on another page oh oh oh twenty dollars for some organic uh aioli uh uh sea salt man that sea Salt's expensive y'all on the fries and we sat down and so we were already thinking listen We're not gonna go crazy here man they're already paying and blessing for us and we sit down at the table and our friend says listen y'all I listen you need to order whatever you want I know the owner of this restaurant he said it's all it's all or he is covering everything whatever you want you can get now if the owner says well hey oh oh y'all the the it has changed we're like okay we were all ordering every appetizer Sharon I went ahead and got that Tomahawk Steak and all the deserted had changed once he said the owner and listen if if we chose not to to or get everything and taste it that would have been our choice not to just taste and see everything on the menu and I want you to know that God's goodness yeah you can get you can taste and see as much of it as you want God's menu is open to you he has so much goodness on his menu you can order it all don't just look at the menu come on get the appetizer the entree the dessert the steak the lobster the shrimp get it all it's all you can eat on God's menu God has so much goodness for your your life God has so many blessings for your life but we still have the choice as to whether we will taste and see because just because the table is prepared full of his goodness doesn't mean you will taste it and experience it last week we talked about why people don't taste and see the goodness of God James 1 verse 16 through 17. it says don't be deceived my dear brothers and sisters every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of heavenly lights who does not change like shifting Shadow we we learned last week in James chapter one that people get deceived into believing that God isn't good because they have a wrong perspective on Trials troubles trauma and Temptation if you miss that message I'd encourage you to go on our YouTube page and YouTube channel and watch that message and today I want us to look at a second reason that people don't taste and see the goodness of God and that's because they don't taste and see they don't step out in faith many of God's good blessings are experienced by faith the goodness of Salvation is experienced by faith the goodness of healing is experienced by faith the goodness of peace is experienced by faith the goodness of joy is experienced by faith the goodness of provision is experienced by faith God won't make you take a step of faith and taste and see God has good gifts he wants to pour into your life but you have to taste and see the stepping out of on faith the stepping out in faith is up to you James talks about this eight verses later James chapter 1 verse 25. it says but if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard then God will bless you for doing it the psalmist talked about this Psalm 84 11 it says for the Lord God is a son and shield the Lord bestows favor and honor no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless you you're you have to walk blameless that's your part Psalm 84 12 it says Lord Almighty blessed is the one who trusts in you see trusting God isn't always easy it's much easier to trust God when everything is going good in our lives but to taste and see the goodness of God you have to trust God during the difficult times the challenging times even the horrific times Psalm 62 8 it says trust in him at all times everybody say all trust in him at all times you people pour out your hearts to him for God is our refuge one of the areas people have a hard time trusting God in is with their finances and this is the biggest area we hear people struggling in we hear so many people saying I need God's provision and blessing I need to experience the goodness of God and it's even more prevalent with inflation the cost of food gas I mean what gas just jumped 50 cents in a in a day interest rates are climbing aggressively it's not easy to trust God at all times put God first to honor God with your money during challenging times but my prayer is for all of us to trust God and honor God at all times Proverbs chapter 3 verse 9 through 10 the Bible says honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruits of all your crops then your barns will be to overflowing and your Vats will brim over with new wine it's not easy to honor the Lord with your wealth with inflation skyrocketing when you're struggling to pay the bills when you're trying to figure out how you're going to keep your lights on when you want a new home or car but prices and interest rates keep Rising when your 401k is declining and when your savings account is shrinking it can be hard to honor the Lord with good financial planning to honor the Lord with a budget to honor the Lord with saving money to honor the Lord with spending less than you make to honor the Lord by taking care of your family and future with retirement and life insurance to honor the Lord by being generous to God and his kingdom and one of the ways we honor God in our generosity is by giving to the Lord first Proverbs 3 9-10 teaches us a principle that's all throughout the Bible we honor God by putting him first with our time talent and treasure we seek first the kingdom of God and the most challenging area to put God first is with our finances the Bible teaches that we honor God with our finances by giving our tithe to God first and from time to time I talk to people who are hesitant or reluctant to honor God by tithing and I want to share with you the four top reasons people are reluctant to tithe four top reasons people are reluctant to tithe the first reason and I've I've heard this before is tithing is under the law some people say they're reluctant to tithe because tithing is a practice that's in the Old Testament it was for those under the law so we don't need the tithe because we're no longer under the law we're now under grace Romans 6 14 it says for sin shall no longer be your master because you are not under the law but under grace and it's very true that we're under grace because we're saved by grace and not by works because of Jesus's death burial and Resurrection we're not under the law but we're now under grace but being under grace doesn't give us the freedom to ignore or to disobey the Commandments and the principles of God listen to what Paul said 13 verses earlier in the same chapter Romans chapter 6 verse 1 and 2. what shall we say then shall we go on sinning so that Grace may increase by no means we are those who have died to sin how can we live in it any longer see Paul didn't say because of Grace we can do whatever we want to do that we can live however we want to live he didn't say the law no longer matters Paul said Grace doesn't lead to disobey God but it actually leads us to obey God and Paul wasn't against the law or the principles of God he was actually for them Romans 2 13 Paul said for it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous Romans 3 31 Paul said do we then nullify the law by this faith not at all rather we uphold the law Romans 7 12 so then the law is Holy and the Commandment is Holy righteous in good from these verses alone we have a good understanding of Paul's attitude toward the law of God here's something else to consider Paul referred to the Old Testament more than 250 times throughout his writings he quoted and referred to the Old Testament a lot of times to prove most of his points and to support his teachings Paul wouldn't have referenced the Old Testament that often if he thought the Old Testament was no longer useful just because something was under the law or in the Old Testament doesn't mean it's obsolete or no longer for today in the Old Testament there were ceremonial laws dietary laws civil laws and moral laws many of the ceremonial in dietary and civil laws we no longer followed today we no longer sacrifice animals for the Forgiveness of sins because Hebrews 10 verse 4 through 5 says Jesus was sacrificed for our sins once and for all acts 10 verse 12-15 it lets us know that we are no longer are forbidden from eating certain type of foods but just because something was under the law or in the Old Testament doesn't mean it's obsolete the Bible is very clear that yes we are under grace but there are some Old Testament laws and principles we still need to obey one example of this is we still obey the Ten Commandments being under grace doesn't give us the ability to murder steal commit adultery or dishonor our father or mother Jesus taught that we should honor some of the laws and principles of the Old Testament look at Matthew 15 19 it says for out of the heart come evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false testimony slander Jesus mentioned several of the Ten Commandments and so Jesus's teaching actually emphasized us doing more not less in Matthew 5 21-22 Jesus said you heard it said don't murder and he was referring to the Old Testament law but I say don't be angry Jesus raised the bar in verses 27 28 he said you heard it said don't commit adultery but I say anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart Jesus didn't lessen the law he raised the bar Grace says God has been so good to me I want to do more not less because of the grace of God and the goodness of God we don't want to worship less but more or thank God less but more or give less no but more or follow God's word less but more or obey his commands and principles less no no we want to do more let me give you the second reason people are reluctant to tithe number two is Jesus didn't talk about tithing I've heard people say I've had many say Jesus didn't talk about tithing first of all basing your theology on what Jesus on that or excuse me basing your theology on Jesus didn't say anything about it is a horrible way to determine your biblical theology Jesus didn't talk about kidnapping child abuse spouse abuse rape drug dealers abusing prescription drugs or using crack cocaine or meth but if you read the totality of the Bible and understand biblical principles those things are wrong Jesus didn't even talk about common sense things like brushing your teeth going to the dentist having a colonoscopy going to elementary school studying for a test he didn't even talk about taking a bath daily I mean come on but we know those things are good in spite of Jesus being silent on them Jesus or the Bible being silent on something is a horrible way to determine theology you have to look at the totality of what scripture says to determine sound biblical theology and the reality is that Jesus did talk about tithing look at Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 he says woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you Hypocrites you give a tenth of your spices meant dill and cumin but you have neglected the more important matters of the law just Emer Justice mercy and faithfulness you should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former Jesus didn't condemn tithing he said you should tithe but don't use tithing as a reason to be a jerk you should tithe but you should also obey the important areas of the law like justice Mercy faithfulness Jesus said do both Luke 11 42 woe to you Pharisees because you give God a tenth of your mint Rue and all other kinds of garden herbs but you neglect Justice and the love of God you should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone Jesus taught do both tithe and practice Justice and loving people with the love of God later in Luke when Jesus told a parable about a self-righteous man he mentioned fasting and tithing Jesus talked about tithing Luke 18 12. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I got we should still fast and yes we should still tithe Jesus did talk about tithing and Jesus didn't lower the bar he raised it what Jesus emphasized in the New Testament wasn't just a tithe but he emphasized extravagant generosity in Luke 21 verse 1 through 4 he was touched by the widow woman that gave all that she had God doesn't lower the bar he raises it in Matthew 19 17-22 Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler to sell all he had and give to the poor Jesus didn't lower the bar he raised it God has been so good to us we don't want to do less we do more because giving is about the heart Jesus taught that giving is about who has your heart Matthew chapter 6 verse 19 through 21 the Bible says do not store up for yourselves Treasures on Earth where moths and Vermin destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasure in heaven where moths and Vermin do not destroy where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also if Earth has your heart you will spend your time trying to figure out how to store up more on Earth but if Heaven has your heart you spend your time figuring out how to give more to God and his kingdom the focus of your heart will determine the focus of your money let me give you the third reason people are reluctant to tie that I've I've heard and here's the third is I don't trust the church I don't trust the church and there are good reasons why people don't trust the church embezzlement promised buildings that were never built were never finished moral failures sexual abuse scandal lying leaders unwise leaders in the list goes on and on I see why some people are leery of giving money to the church there's a lot of mistrust and that's one of the reasons we work hard at People's Church to operate with high integrity and Trust we strive to live by the Bible we do our best to hold our pastors to a standard of what the Bible calls above reproach we do background checks on all of our staff and all of our kids and youth volunteer dream team leaders we have all of our volunteer leaders sign and Honor Code we have a Board of Trustees that provides accountability and Leadership over church and finances we have an annual audit of the finances by an outside CPA firm every year we we strive to live by Apostle Paul's words in second Corinthians 8 21 it says for we are taking pains to do what is right not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man at People's Church we are taking great pains to do what is right in the eyes of God and people and yet no matter all the steps we take there's still no perfect church because there's no Perfect People but God made his imperfect Church to be the primary vehicle to reach the world Jesus said in Matthew 16 18 that he is building his church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against his church God is building his church and his followers should be building what Jesus is building and one of the ways God builds God's church and keeps his church strong is through his people giving their tithe and offerings Malachi 3 10 it says bring the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house God wants food and resources in his house so that his church is strong and can meet the needs of the people to do Outreach do missions feed the hungry clothe the naked provide clean water fight Injustice preach the gospel around the world to disciple people to raise up an army of kids and teenagers who will fear the lord to heal the brokenhearted to reach lost and hurting Humanity Jesus is building his church and he wants his church strong that's one of the Reason God says bring your tithe to the storehouse the local church where you worship see the tithe doesn't go to a non-profit or missions organization or to a Ministry or a person you love it goes to the local church so that the local church is strong then over and above your tithe we give offerings to all other organizations and people no church is perfect but the church is God's primary vehicle to reach the world and God is building his church let me give you the fourth reason fourth reason people are reluctant to tithe number four is I don't trust God I don't trust God some people don't tithe because they don't trust God if I tithe what God really provide for me I think I'm better at keeping a hundred percent of my income rather than honoring God by giving him the first ten percent of my income and God knew this would be a struggle for many people and so here's what he says in Malachi 3 10 bring the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house test me in this says the Lord Almighty and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be enough room not be room enough to store it God says test me I'm trustworthy I will provide for you I will bless you for honoring me if you provide for my house I will provide for your house and it's important to understand that God pouring out so much blessing doesn't exempt you from being a good manager of His blessings see people oftentimes blame God for things that are not his fault God I tried tithing and it didn't work God didn't provide for me God didn't bless me and God says I did bless you I'm not a liar I'm trustworthy I provided resources I gave you a job I gave you a raise I gave you a promotion but you spent it you're driving it you're wearing it you're living in it you ate it at the restaurant you talking text on it every day it's going to Visa in MasterCard I blessed you but you spent it because God always blesses us he is faithful he is trustworthy he always provides for us when we honor him it's a promise in his word God is trustworthy and there are thousands of people in our church who have trusted God with their tithe and have seen God bless their life check out this video I was I was doubtful I was not in a place where I I was hard-hearted so I wasn't in a place where the concept of tithing was really on the Forefront right or really I was I wasn't really open to it we were tested early on in our marriage as newlyweds I found myself out of a job and she was a school teacher at that time that wasn't making much money we've been through economy affecting both of our Industries having to relocate um we've had to deal with like taking a a pay cut in our jobs we started tithing in November of 2020 which was around the time that we started coming to People's Church after making that decision to start that gave an opportunity for God to uh show his faithfulness to Mandy and I to show himself as provider and really to meet me where I was which was is in the place of a skeptic and in the place of a doubter who you know wanted to hold on to what I have and hold on to mine rather than give back to God what was his we actually made a conscious effort to demonstrate Lord we trust you in every aspect of our life whether it's giving our kids over to the Lord giving our marriage over to the Lord giving our finances over to the Lord and not giving Lord not giving God the leftovers right more so of God we gotta trust you and give you the first fruit God's given me these opportunities to go to school to learn to do all the things and that's just my response to him is this is this is important it's going to go first tithing has allowed me to learn to do and grow is have faith in God he's the one who's our provider and you know he will always make sure that we're made you know whole and true and and so through that you know I just we continue to tithe in a way that regardless of what may happen on external or outside of our control we don't have to worry because God has always been there for us and will continue to be for us yeah my trust in him has grown significantly just because the Step Beyond in faith you know you can't see it on the other side but once he is faithful and it does happen that's when your faith grows and then you just walk in it and then you're a walking testimony at that point and over and over down through the years God has blessed us when we have sacrificially given and thought we can't do that God has always provided and the blessings have been abundant we do it because we we've been blessed in the past and we just know that in the future that God's going to always provide for us and take care of us God is always faithful you can never outgive God that even when you look at your banking account and I can do math pretty quick and say this is going to work it does it does God's math works even though we as individuals can't explain I think that once we take the leap of faith to start tithing um your heart changes and you are able to see the little blessings that God has for you along the way so we have to trust that God is going to fulfill our every need and provide for us and take care of us in that way the Bible literally says test me and see and just knowing that God's word says to test me to try me we wanted to make sure that we were like putting his words to the test and we've seen that even though we've hit that law God has never failed us God has never let us down amen God says test me test me and see and so if you're not tithing here at People's Church we want to give you an opportunity to test God and see his goodness and his faithfulness and so we have what we call the three-month tithe challenge one of these cards or a couple of them in the seat back pockets that are near you and if you're not tithing would you test God would you test them and see and basically this is a money back guarantee you'll read on the card that if you start tithing and Faithfully tithe for three months you feel like God hasn't blessed you will refund your tithe no questions asked and so I just wanted to give you a moment I want to give you an opportunity he's faithful he is a good God just like all the people said you will you will never taste and see you'll never taste and see until you step out you'll never taste and see until you'll test God you'll never see taste and see just the blessings he wants to pour out on your life till you test God and so if you're not tithing or maybe you've been in maybe just you're not sure you've been on and off would you would you test and see would you do the three month tithe challenge again in the seat box package near you are some of our seat back pockets are a little deeper and you may just have to reach in there but the worship team's just going to sing a song here about the goodness of God and if you're already tithing you know what I'm talking about you've tasted and you've seen his goodness and his faithfulness but if you haven't would you take the three-month tithe challenge worship team is going to sing and give you a moment here just to fill out this card we move the offering to the end of service so that when we collect the offering you can go ahead and drop your tithe challenge card in the bucket as well but let's just take a moment right now to just worship and if you need a moment to fill out the card you can do that right now
7c_yxXjQMyI," FROM OUR ARCHIVES...  THE BILLY GRAHAM CLASSICS. [applause] NOW, TONIGHT I WANT YOU TO TURN WITH ME TO THE 19TH CHAPTER  OF LUKE'S GOSPEL, THE 19TH CHAPTER. JESUS IS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO AT THIS POINT  IN SCRIPTURE. AND A BLIND MAN SCREAMED OUT AND SAID, ""JESUS, THOU SON OF DAVID, HAVE MERCY UPON ME."" AND JESUS TOUCHED HIM AND HE WAS HEALED. AND NOW HE'S PASSING RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF JERICHO AND ANOTHER INCIDENT HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME. ""AND JESUS ENTERED AND PASSED THROUGH JERICHO. ""AND, BEHOLD, THERE WAS A MAN NAMED ZACCHAEUS, ""WHICH WAS THE CHIEF AMONG THE PUBLICANS, ""AND HE WAS VERY RICH. ""AND HE SOUGHT TO SEE JESUS WHO HE WAS; ""AND COULD NOT  FOR THE PRESS."" THAT MEANS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, THAT DOESN'T MEAN  THE MEDIA. ""BECAUSE HE WAS LITTLE OF STATURE. ""AND HE RAN BEFORE, AND CLIMBED UP INTO A SYCAMORE TREE ""TO SEE HIM: FOR HE WAS TO PASS THAT WAY. ""AND WHEN JESUS CAME TO THE PLACE, HE LOOKED UP, ""AND SAW HIM, AND SAID TO HIM, ZACCHAEUS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME DOWN; FOR TODAY ""I GOING TO ABIDE  AT YOUR HOUSE. ""AND HE MADE HASTE, AND HE CAME DOWN, ""AND HE RECEIVED HIM JOYFULLY. ""AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY ALL MURMURED, AND SAYING, ""THAT HE WAS GONE TO BE THE GUEST ""WITH A MAN WHO'S A SINNER. ""AND ZACCHAEUS STOOD, AND SAID UNTO THE LORD: ""BEHOLD, LORD, HALF OF ALL MY GOODS ""I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THE POOR; ""AND IF I HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING FROM ANY MAN ""BY FALSE ACCUSATION, I RESTORE FOURFOLD. ""AND JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, ""THIS DAY, THIS DAY ""IS SALVATION COME TO THIS HOUSE, ""FOR AS MUCH AS HE ALSO IS A SON OF ABRAHAM. ""FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST."" THE SON OF MAN IS COME TO SEEK AND SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT THAT ARE LOST. YOU'RE NOT LOST FROM YOUR PARENTS, SO MUCH, OR LOST FROM YOUR FRIENDS. YOU ARE LOST FROM GOD. YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM GOD. AND JESUS HAS COME TO SEEK YOU OUT. AND HE SOUGHT OUT ZACCHAEUS. AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY AS JESUS WAS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO. NOW YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS WAS A PUBLICAN. THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS A TAX GATHERER AND HE WORKED FOR ROME. HE WAS RICH. HE WAS DESPISED. HE WAS A SOCIAL OUTCAST. THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE TAX GATHERERS GATHERING TAXES FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT DOMINATED THEM. AND IF JESUS HAD CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION HE WOULD HAVE NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT ZACCHAEUS. BUT JESUS NEVER CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT ""ON ALL OCCASIONS JESUS MADE OF HIMSELF ""NO REPUTATION."" AND I IMAGINE IT HAD BEEN MANY MONTHS SINCE ANYONE HAD EVER CROSSED VOLUNTARILY INTO ZACCHAEUS' HOUSE. A MAN OF GREAT RICHES, BUT HE WAS A LONELY MAN. HE WAS A HATED MAN. HE WAS AVOIDED BY ALMOST EVERYBODY IN TOWN. BUT HIS CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM. HE WANTED TO SEE JESUS. HE'D POSSIBLY HEARD ABOUT JESUS. AND HE'D HEARD THEM CALL HIM MANY NAMES. SOME PEOPLE HAD CALLED JESUS A DEVIL. SOME SAID HE WAS A FANATIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A BLASPHEMER. SOME SAID HE WAS A HERETIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A PROPHET. SOME SAID HE WAS AN IMPOSTER. AND MANY SAID THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE SON OF GOD. SO NATURALLY, ZACCHAEUS HAD A TREMENDOUS CURIOSITY TO SEE JESUS. BUT YOU SEE, TO SEE JESUS HE HAD SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY TO GET TO JESUS. THERE WAS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, A BIG CROWD. AND HE WAS A LITTLE FELLA. AND TO TRY TO PUSH HIS WAY THROUGH THAT CROWD WAS VERY DIFFICULT. AND HE WAS ALSO SMALL OF STATURE. HE WAS A VERY SMALL MAN. AND TO GET THROUGH THE CROWD WAS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS. AND MANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE JESUS IN YOUR HEART, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE SALVATION, BUT YOU FACE MANY OBSTACLES. WHAT ARE THEY? LET'S JUST LIST A FEW OF THEM THAT YOU FACE. FIRST IS PRIDE. THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT PRIDE KEEPS MORE PEOPLE FROM CHRIST THAN ANY OTHER SIN. THE SIN OF PRIDE. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD ""BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE."" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""IF ANY MAN AMONG YOU SEEMETH TO BE WISE IN THIS WORLD ""LET HIM BECOME A FOOL THAT HE MAY BE WISE."" JESUS SAID WE ARE TO BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN TO BE CONVERTED. AND IF YOU'RE TO GET CLOSE TO CHRIST AND HAVE CHRIST IN YOUR HEART YOU MAY BE WISE, BUT YOU MUST BECOME A FOOL. YOU MUST BECOME AS A CHILD. YOU SEE WE'RE ALL PROUD. AND WE DON'T LIKE TO HUMBLE OURSELVES. AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST IS IDOLATRY. AND IDOLATRY IS ANOTHER SIN AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS MENTIONED IS KEEPING MORE PEOPLE FROM GOD THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER SIN. AND OUR IDOLATRY IS VERY UNIQUE IN OUR DAY BECAUSE WE WORSHIP OURSELVES. WE WORSHIP MAN. WHETHER WE REALIZE IT OR NOT, WE'RE WORSHIPING OURSELVES, THE THINGS THAT WE'VE CREATED, THE THINGS WE'VE MADE WITH OUR HANDS. WHETHER IT'S A TELEVISION SET OR A NEW AUTOMOBILE, MATERIALISM. ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BECOME GODS AND GODDESSES. SEX HAS BECOME A GODDESS JUST AS MUCH AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF EPHESUS OR IN THE DAYS OF ROME. THESE ARE THE MODERN GODS. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IDOLATRY, THOSE THAT COMMIT IT, ""SHALL HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE ""WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE: ""WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH,"" IN REVELATION  21:8. GOD HATES IDOLATRY. AND THEN THE THIRD THING WHICH MAY KEEP SOME OF YOU FROM CHRIST IS WORLDLINESS. ""FOR WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED IF HE SHALL GAIN ""THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL? ""OR WHAT SHALL A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL?"" SAID JESUS IN MATTHEW 16. THERE ARE MANY OF YOU THAT ARE SELLING YOUR SOUL, YOUR ETERNAL SPIRIT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THIS WORLD. BUT JESUS SAID, SUPPOSE YOU GOT ALL THE OIL OF THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL THE GOLD IN SOUTH AFRICA, ALL THE DIAMONDS IN HOLLAND, ALL THE WEALTH OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND YOU HAD IT ALL, ALL THE MUSIC, ALL THE CULTURE, ALL THE PHILOSOPHY, ALL THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE WORLD, YOU HAD IT ALL AND LOST YOUR SOUL? IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT. AND YET, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR SOUL FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IT. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT TO HAVE MONEY. NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE DOES GOD CONDEMN A WEALTHY MAN UNLESS HE MISUSES IT OR UNLESS HE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY. THEN HE'S CONDEMNED. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, ""KNOW YE NOT ""THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE WORLD IS ENMITY WITH GOD? ""WHOSOEVER THEREFORE WILL BE A FRIEND OF THE WORLD ""IS THE ENEMY OF GOD."" NOW WHAT DOES THAT WORD ""WORLD"" MEAN? IT'S COSMOS , IT MEANS A WORLD SYSTEM DOMINATED BY EVIL. THAT EVIL PART OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEM IN WHICH WE LIVE. FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT MEANS ENMITY WITH GOD. AND GOD SAYS, ""COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND BE YE SEPARATE ""SAITH THE LORD AND TOUCH NOT THE UNCLEAN THING."" WORLDLINESS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MEANT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT PEOPLE HAD WITH THEIR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. NOW PERHAPS YOU SAW THOSE HUGE PICTURES ON TELEVISION A FEW MONTHS AGO OF SOME FORTY WHALES, WHO FOR SOME UNKNOWN BIOLOGICAL REASON BEACHED THEMSELVES AND DIED. THEY LEFT THEIR LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR ONE OF DEATH AND DIED. AND MANY OF YOU HAVE LEFT THE ENVIRONMENT OF LIVING IN THE SCRIPTURES AND LIVING FOR GOD, AND GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD AND YOUR SOUL IS DEAD TOWARD GOD. IT'S LIKE THE LEMMING IN SCANDINAVIA. THEY BAND TOGETHER. AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WALK DOWN INTO THE OCEAN AND DIE. YOU DELIBERATELY BRING ON YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL DEATH. YOU PROMOTE YOUR OWN ETERNAL DEATH BY GOING WITH THE EVILS OF THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU. AND THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU SQUEEZES YOU INTO ITS MOLD AND IT BECOMES A HINDRANCE TO YOU COMING TO JESUS CHRIST. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE WRONG THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WORLD; THE LUST AND THE GREED AND THE HATE AND THE PREJUDICE AND THE MATERIALISM PART OF THE WORLD THAT'S WRONG, YOU HAVE TO TURN FROM WHEN YOU COME TO CHRIST. AND THAT'S THE REASON IT'S SO HARD TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE MODERN DAY. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I'M NOT GOING TO FOOL YOU. I WOULD THINK IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO BE A CHRISTIAN RIGHT NOW IN MODERN AMERICA OR MODERN WESTERN WORLD THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD. YOU SEE TO BE A CHRISTIAN IN SOME PARTS OF THE ORIENT OR SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO REALLY STAND FOR CHRIST AND YOU HAVE TO SUFFER. BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S NO SUFFERING AND NO PHYSICAL PERSECUTION IT'S RATHER EASY JUST TO SLIDE ALONG, REALLY NOT KNOWING CHRIST. CALLING YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN BUT NOT REALLY BEING A CHRISTIAN, NOT A NEW TESTAMENT CHRISTIAN. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT HAVE GONE TO CHURCH ALL THEIR LIVES AND BEEN BAPTIZED AND CONFIRMED BUT STILL NOT KNOWING CHRIST. AND THEN ANOTHER OBSTACLE ARE SECRET SINS THE BIBLE SAYS. THE PSALMIST PRAYED, ""CLEANSE THOU ME FROM SECRET THOUGHTS."" AND PAUL WROTE TO THE ROMANS, ""THE DAY WHEN GOD SHALL JUDGE THE SECRETS OF MEN ""BY JESUS CHRIST."" YOU CAN KEEP NO SECRETS FROM GOD. YOUR FRIENDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW. AND GOD HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THEM. IT'S LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK ON TELEVISION. I THINK I'VE SEEN IT ONCE, MAYBE TWICE. BUT I READ ABOUT IT. AND IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY, IT'S TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PERSON INSIDE OF HIM, ALWAYS. AND PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN BATTLING WITH THE HIDDEN MAN IN YOUR HEART WITH YOUR SECRET SINS. CONFESS THEM TO CHRIST TONIGHT. COME TO THE CROSS AND BRING THOSE SECRETS OF YOUR HEART AND LAY THEM BEFORE HIM AND SAY, ""LORD, HERE THEY ARE. ""I SURRENDER."" AND THEN SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ANOTHER THING THAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM CHRIST. ""THERE IS A GENERATION,"" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THAT ARE PURE IN THEIR OWN EYES ""AND YET THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WASHED FROM THEIR FILTHINESS."" PURE IN OUR OWN EYES. PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE BAD. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE SINNING AND BREAKING GOD'S LAWS. THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST, SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOW WE'VE SEEN THE OBSTACLES, LET'S LOOK AT JESUS. IT'S A PERSONAL CALL. JESUS TURNS TO ZACCHAEUS AND CALLS HIM BY NAME. HE SEES ZACCHAEUS UP THE TREE. YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS HAD CLIMBED A SYCAMORE TREE AND WAS OUT ON THE LIMB, SITTING THERE WATCHING JESUS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST HATED MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST SINFUL MAN IN TOWN HEARS HIS NAME CALLED BY THE GREAT PROPHET, JESUS. AND JESUS SAYS, ""ZACCHAEUS."" CAN YOU IMAGE HOW STARTLED HE WAS THAT OUT OF ALL THAT CROWD AND THOSE RELIGIOUS LEADERS, HE, THE WORST SINNER IN TOWN, CALLED BY HIS NAME? THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS IS THE GOOD SHEPHERD. HE CALLETH HIS OWN SHEEP BY NAME AND LEADETH THEM. IN GENESIS WE READ THAT GOD CAME IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN PERSONALLY TO CALL ADAM. HE SAID, ""ADAM, ADAM, WHERE ART THOU?"" AND LATER HE CALLED ABRAHAM. HE SAID, ""ABRAHAM, JACOB, MOSES, JOSHUA, GIDEON, SAMUEL, ""DAVID, SOLOMON."" HE CALLED THEM ALL BY NAME. ""ISAIAH, JEREMIAH, EZEKIEL, DANIEL."" HE CALLED THEM BY NAME. AND THEN WHEN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST CAME HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES BY NAME. HE WENT DOWN BY THE SEASHORE AND HE CALLED OUT, ""SIMON PETER, ""ANDREW, JAMES, JOHN."" AND FROM THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM ANOTHER MAN, LIKE ZACCHAEUS, A TAX GATHERER, ""MATTHEW, COME AND FOLLOW ME."" AND HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED JESUS IMMEDIATELY. AND ON THE DAMASCUS ROAD, HE SAID, ""SAUL, SAUL, SAUL, WHY DO YOU PERSECUTE ME?"" AND ON THE ISLE OF PATMOS, HE SAID, ""JOHN."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. WHAT IS YOUR NAME; JIM, MARY, SUSIE, PETER? HE CALLED YOU BY NAME TONIGHT. HE KNOWS YOUR NAME. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MARY, GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT ""AND COME AND RECEIVE ME TONIGHT. ""I WANT TO COME INTO YOUR HOUSE AND INTO YOUR HEART."" ""JIM, YOU NEED ME. ""YOU KNOW YOU NEED ME TO HELP YOU, TO FORGIVE YOU, ""TO TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN. ""GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. HE LOOKED UP IN THE TREE AND SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS."" AND IT WAS AN URGENT CALL. HE SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS, MAKE HASTE, HURRY. ""WE DON'T HAVE LONG."" AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS TO YOU. HURRY, MAKE HASTE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO CHRIST, COME NOW. YOU MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT LIKE THIS. NOWHERE DOES THE BIBLE PROMISE TOMORROW YOU CAN BE SAVED. IT'S TODAY; TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. NOW IS THE ACCEPTED TIME. THERE MAY NOT BE A TOMORROW FOR YOU. THERE'S A LITTLE VERSE IN YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT SOMETIMES I MISS WHEN I HEAR IT SUNG. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. ""OH LORD OUR GOD, ARISE ON THEE OUR HOPES WE FIX. ""GOD SAVE US ALL."" TONIGHT THAT WOULD BE MY PRAYER FOR YOU. GOD SAVE US ALL. AND THAT'S WHAT THE LORD JESUS CAME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH IS LOST."" TODAY HE'S URGENTLY CALLING YOU BY NAME. AND IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL CALL BECAUSE ZACCHAEUS DID MAKE HASTE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE DIDN'T WAIT TO CLIMB DOWN THE TREE. HE JUMPED. AND D.L. MOODY, THE EVANGELIST OF THE LAST CENTURY, SAID THAT ZACCHAEUS WAS CONVERTED FROM THE LIMB TO THE GROUND. AND I EXPECT THAT'S ABOUT TRUE. THE RICH YOUNG RULER CAME TO JESUS. HE FELL DOWN BEFORE JESUS. HE WAS RUNNING TO JESUS. MAKING HASTE TO GET TO JESUS. AND HE GOT TO JESUS, BUT HE COULDN'T PAY THE PRICE. AND HE WAS LOST EVEN THOUGH JESUS LOVED HIM AND JESUS TRIED AND JESUS TALKED WITH HIM AND GAVE HIM PRECIOUS TIME. YET THAT YOUNG MAN NEVER CAME TO JESUS. BUT ZACCHAEUS, THE GREAT SINNER, DID COME TO JESUS. AND JESUS WENT TO ZACCHAEUS' HOME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK JESUS PROBABLY TOOK MATTHEW WITH HIM. AND I EXPECT THAT MATTHEW AND ZACCHAEUS GOT INTO A CONVERSATION LATE INTO THE NIGHT. AND MATTHEW TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. HOW HE HAD BEEN ALSO A TAX GATHERER AND HOW HE HAD BEEN A SINNER AND HOW JESUS HAD CALLED HIM BY NAME. AND HE SAID, ""FOLLOW ME."" AND MATTHEW SAID, ""I GOT UP RIGHT THEN AND FOLLOWED HIM ""AND I'VE NEVER REGRETTED ONE MINUTE OF IT. ""HE CHANGED MY LIFE, HE'S GIVEN ME ASSURANCE. ""HE'S BLESSED MY FAMILY. ""HE'S BROUGHT OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. ""OH, I'D DIE FOR HIM. ""I'VE GIVEN HIM MY LIFE."" AND ZACCHAEUS HEARD THAT. AND I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM THAT NIGHT, ""YOU KNOW ZACCHAEUS, ""IF YOU COME TO CHRIST, IF YOU COME TO JESUS, ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME RESTITUTION. ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE WAY OF LIVING. ""AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECLARE OPENLY ""YOUR ALLEGIANCE FOR JESUS CHRIST."" WE'RE TO BE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT OF IT. WE LIVE IN TWO WORLDS. WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD, BUT WE'RE ALSO CITIZENS OF ANOTHER WORLD, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. AND OUR FIRST ALLEGIANCE IS ALWAYS TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. YES, I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WHAT WAS THE RESULT? THE RESULT WAS THAT ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST. NOW RECEIVING CHRIST INVOLVES AN ACT OF FAITH BEYOND MERE HUMAN REASON. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVETH NOT ""THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD ""FOR THEY'RE FOOLISHNESS UNTO HIM. ""NEITHER CAN HE KNOW THEM BECAUSE ""THEY'RE SPIRITUALLY DISCERNED."" IN OTHER WORDS, A NATURAL PERSON LIKE YOU JUST CANNOT COME AND REASON HIS WAY TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. YOU CANNOT REASON YOUR WAY TO CHRIST. I DON'T IMAGINE ZACCHAEUS SAT DOWN AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE PHILOSOPHY AND ALL THE THEOLOGICAL DEBATES ABOUT JESUS. HE JUST JOYFULLY RECEIVED HIM BY FAITH. SIMPLY LIKE A LITTLE CHILD. AND JESUS RECEIVED HIM AND FORGAVE HIM. YOU SEE CHRIST IS KNOCKING ON OUR HEART'S DOOR TONIGHT. HE'S ASKING PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO RECEIVE HIM. AND THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SAYING, THEY ACCUSED HIM BY SAYING, ""THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS."" ARE YOU A SINNER? HAVE YOU BROKEN GOD'S LAW? I'M A SINNER. ARE YOU? SURE YOU ARE. HE RECEIVETH SINNERS. ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL THING THAT HE RECEIVETH SINNERS? AND WHEN I STAND, AND IF THEY SHOULD ASK ME AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN WHEN I DIE, ""WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?"" I'M GOING TO SAY, ""I'M HERE BY THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD ""BECAUSE OF WHAT JESUS CHRIST DID ON THE CROSS. ""I'M NOT HERE BY ANY GOOD WORKS BILLY GRAHAM EVER DID."" I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PREACHED IN A BIG STADIUM FULL OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS TONIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE READ THE BIBLE. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PRAYED. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN WIFE AND FIVE CHRISTIAN CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD. I'M A SINNER. I DESERVE JUDGMENT, I DESERVE HELL. I'M GOING BECAUSE OF CHRIST. AND I HAVE RECEIVED CHRIST. I'VE LET HIM COME INTO MY HEART. AND I'VE COME TO THE CROSS. HE'S FORGIVEN MY SIN. I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. I KNOW I'M SAVED TONIGHT. I KNOW WHERE I'VE COME FROM. I KNOW WHY I'M HERE. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. AND IF HE SHOULD COME TONIGHT, I'M READY. DO YOU KNOW THAT? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS. ""BUT AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, ""TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME SONS OF GOD ""EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ON HIS NAME."" YOU RECEIVE HIM AND LET HIM COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND YOU'LL FIND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE JOYFUL. WITHOUT CHRIST TO FILL THAT EMPTY VOID IN YOUR LIFE NOTHING ELSE SATISFIES. SEX DOESN'T DO IT. DRUGS DOESN'T DO IT. POWER, POPULARITY, ALL OF THAT IS NOTHING. CHRIST IS EVERYTHING. AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE CHRIST YOU'RE READY TO LIVE HERE AND NOW. LIFE WITH A CAPITAL L WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR SAVIOR. YES, ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST JOYFULLY. AND NOTICE ANOTHER THING, ZACCHAEUS OPENLY CONFESSED CHRIST, PUBLICLY. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF ALL OF HIS FRIENDS IN THE WHOLE TOWN AND HE SAID, ""I'VE BEEN WRONG, I'VE BEEN A SINNER. ""I'M READY TO RESTORE EVERYTHING I EVER DID IF NECESSARY. ""WHATEVER IT TAKES. ""FROM NOW ON I'M FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST. ""HE IS MY LORD AND HE IS MY SAVIOR. ""HE CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE ME IN THIS TOWN OF JERICHO."" HE CAME TO HALIFAX IN THE FORM OF THIS CRUSADE TO SEEK AND TO SAVE YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME WHILE THERE'S TIME."" BECAUSE YOU SEE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER DENIETH THE SON, THE SAME HATH NOT THE FATHER. ""HE THAT CONFESSED THE SON OPENLY ""HATH THE FATHER ALSO."" ALSO THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER SHALL CONFESS THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD ""DWELLETH IN HIM AND HE IN GOD."" AND JESUS SAID, ""IF YOU DENY ME BEFORE MEN."" IF YOU DENY ME PUBLICLY; ""I'LL NOT CONFESS YOU ""BEFORE MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN."" YOU SEE JESUS CHRIST HUNG ON THE CROSS PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, DYING, BLEEDING FOR YOU. AND HE ASKS YOU TO PUBLICLY RECEIVE HIM. AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO THAT IN A MOMENT. THERE'RE THREE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO. FIRST, LISTEN TO THIS SO YOU CAN NEVER STAND AT THE JUDGMENT AND SAY, ""I NEVER KNEW."" FIRST, YOU MUST REPENT OF YOUR SIN. HOW DO YOU REPENT? THE WORD REPENT MEANS TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. IT MEANS TO TURN. YOU'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION IN YOUR LIFE, YOU TURN AROUND AND START IN A NEW DIRECTION. NOW, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TURN BY YOURSELF. IF FACT YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO SAY, ""LORD, HELP ME TO TURN, ""HELP ME TO REPENT."" IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LET CHRIST COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR WHOLE PATTERN OF LIVING, YOUR LIFESTYLE, EVERYTHING, IF NECESSARY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING, BY FAITH YOU RECEIVE HIM. NOW THAT WORD FAITH MAY CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE. IT MEANS THAT YOU COMMIT, THAT YOU SURRENDER YOUR TOTAL LIFE  TO JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER GOD, YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER RELIGION. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANYTHING BUT JESUS CHRIST AND HIM ALONE TO SAVE YOU. THAT'S FAITH, TOTAL COMMITMENT TO CHRIST. AND THEN THIRDLY, YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW HIM. YOU'RE WILLING TO BE HIS DISCIPLE. NOW THE WORD DISCIPLE MEANS LEARNER OR DISCIPLINE. IT MEANS DISCIPLINED LEARNING. YOU'RE FOLLOWING HIM. GROWING IN THE GRACE AND KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BY STUDYING THE BIBLE, BY PRAYER, BY WITNESSING, BY ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH. YOU SAY, ""WELL, BILLY, YOU KNOW MOST OF THOSE THINGS ""I'M ALREADY DOING."" BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST? ARE YOU SURE OF IT? IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, IF YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN THAT CHRIST IS IN YOUR HEART TONIGHT AND THAT YOUR SIN IS FORGIVEN, HE'S CALLING YOU BY NAME. HE SEES YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE AND COME."" I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT RIGHT NOW, HUNDREDS OF YOU FROM EVERYWHERE AS WE'VE SEEN EVERY NIGHT. GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME AND STAND IN FRONT. AND SAY BY COMING, ""I WANT TO COME TO THE CROSS ""BY FAITH TONIGHT AND I WANT MY SINS FORGIVEN. ""I WANT TO KNOW THAT I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. ""I WANT TO KNOW I'M GOING TO HEAVEN."" YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW, QUICKLY AND STAND HERE. IF YOU'RE WITH FRIENDS OR RELATIVES THEY'LL WAIT. AND AFTER YOU COME, I'M GOING TO SAY A WORD TO YOU AND HAVE A PRAYER WITH YOU. AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME LITERATURE TO HELP YOU IN YOUR CHRISTIAN LIFE. AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND JOIN YOUR FRIENDS. BUT I'M GOING TO ASK NO ONE TO LEAVE THE STADIUM NOW AT THIS HOLY MOMENT. EVERYONE IN AN ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY COMING. YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW TOO. GOD IS CALLING YOU BY NAME. JESUS IS LOOKING IN YOUR DIRECTION. AND HE KNOWS YOUR HEART AND HE SAYS, ""COME."" YOU GET UP AND COME QUICKLY.

7c_yxXjQMyI," FROM OUR ARCHIVES...  THE BILLY GRAHAM CLASSICS. [applause] NOW, TONIGHT I WANT YOU TO TURN WITH ME TO THE 19TH CHAPTER  OF LUKE'S GOSPEL, THE 19TH CHAPTER. JESUS IS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO AT THIS POINT  IN SCRIPTURE. AND A BLIND MAN SCREAMED OUT AND SAID, ""JESUS, THOU SON OF DAVID, HAVE MERCY UPON ME."" AND JESUS TOUCHED HIM AND HE WAS HEALED. AND NOW HE'S PASSING RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF JERICHO AND ANOTHER INCIDENT HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME. ""AND JESUS ENTERED AND PASSED THROUGH JERICHO. ""AND, BEHOLD, THERE WAS A MAN NAMED ZACCHAEUS, ""WHICH WAS THE CHIEF AMONG THE PUBLICANS, ""AND HE WAS VERY RICH. ""AND HE SOUGHT TO SEE JESUS WHO HE WAS; ""AND COULD NOT  FOR THE PRESS."" THAT MEANS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, THAT DOESN'T MEAN  THE MEDIA. ""BECAUSE HE WAS LITTLE OF STATURE. ""AND HE RAN BEFORE, AND CLIMBED UP INTO A SYCAMORE TREE ""TO SEE HIM: FOR HE WAS TO PASS THAT WAY. ""AND WHEN JESUS CAME TO THE PLACE, HE LOOKED UP, ""AND SAW HIM, AND SAID TO HIM, ZACCHAEUS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME DOWN; FOR TODAY ""I GOING TO ABIDE  AT YOUR HOUSE. ""AND HE MADE HASTE, AND HE CAME DOWN, ""AND HE RECEIVED HIM JOYFULLY. ""AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY ALL MURMURED, AND SAYING, ""THAT HE WAS GONE TO BE THE GUEST ""WITH A MAN WHO'S A SINNER. ""AND ZACCHAEUS STOOD, AND SAID UNTO THE LORD: ""BEHOLD, LORD, HALF OF ALL MY GOODS ""I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THE POOR; ""AND IF I HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING FROM ANY MAN ""BY FALSE ACCUSATION, I RESTORE FOURFOLD. ""AND JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, ""THIS DAY, THIS DAY ""IS SALVATION COME TO THIS HOUSE, ""FOR AS MUCH AS HE ALSO IS A SON OF ABRAHAM. ""FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST."" THE SON OF MAN IS COME TO SEEK AND SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT THAT ARE LOST. YOU'RE NOT LOST FROM YOUR PARENTS, SO MUCH, OR LOST FROM YOUR FRIENDS. YOU ARE LOST FROM GOD. YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM GOD. AND JESUS HAS COME TO SEEK YOU OUT. AND HE SOUGHT OUT ZACCHAEUS. AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY AS JESUS WAS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO. NOW YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS WAS A PUBLICAN. THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS A TAX GATHERER AND HE WORKED FOR ROME. HE WAS RICH. HE WAS DESPISED. HE WAS A SOCIAL OUTCAST. THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE TAX GATHERERS GATHERING TAXES FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT DOMINATED THEM. AND IF JESUS HAD CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION HE WOULD HAVE NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT ZACCHAEUS. BUT JESUS NEVER CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT ""ON ALL OCCASIONS JESUS MADE OF HIMSELF ""NO REPUTATION."" AND I IMAGINE IT HAD BEEN MANY MONTHS SINCE ANYONE HAD EVER CROSSED VOLUNTARILY INTO ZACCHAEUS' HOUSE. A MAN OF GREAT RICHES, BUT HE WAS A LONELY MAN. HE WAS A HATED MAN. HE WAS AVOIDED BY ALMOST EVERYBODY IN TOWN. BUT HIS CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM. HE WANTED TO SEE JESUS. HE'D POSSIBLY HEARD ABOUT JESUS. AND HE'D HEARD THEM CALL HIM MANY NAMES. SOME PEOPLE HAD CALLED JESUS A DEVIL. SOME SAID HE WAS A FANATIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A BLASPHEMER. SOME SAID HE WAS A HERETIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A PROPHET. SOME SAID HE WAS AN IMPOSTER. AND MANY SAID THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE SON OF GOD. SO NATURALLY, ZACCHAEUS HAD A TREMENDOUS CURIOSITY TO SEE JESUS. BUT YOU SEE, TO SEE JESUS HE HAD SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY TO GET TO JESUS. THERE WAS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, A BIG CROWD. AND HE WAS A LITTLE FELLA. AND TO TRY TO PUSH HIS WAY THROUGH THAT CROWD WAS VERY DIFFICULT. AND HE WAS ALSO SMALL OF STATURE. HE WAS A VERY SMALL MAN. AND TO GET THROUGH THE CROWD WAS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS. AND MANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE JESUS IN YOUR HEART, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE SALVATION, BUT YOU FACE MANY OBSTACLES. WHAT ARE THEY? LET'S JUST LIST A FEW OF THEM THAT YOU FACE. FIRST IS PRIDE. THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT PRIDE KEEPS MORE PEOPLE FROM CHRIST THAN ANY OTHER SIN. THE SIN OF PRIDE. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD ""BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE."" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""IF ANY MAN AMONG YOU SEEMETH TO BE WISE IN THIS WORLD ""LET HIM BECOME A FOOL THAT HE MAY BE WISE."" JESUS SAID WE ARE TO BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN TO BE CONVERTED. AND IF YOU'RE TO GET CLOSE TO CHRIST AND HAVE CHRIST IN YOUR HEART YOU MAY BE WISE, BUT YOU MUST BECOME A FOOL. YOU MUST BECOME AS A CHILD. YOU SEE WE'RE ALL PROUD. AND WE DON'T LIKE TO HUMBLE OURSELVES. AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST IS IDOLATRY. AND IDOLATRY IS ANOTHER SIN AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS MENTIONED IS KEEPING MORE PEOPLE FROM GOD THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER SIN. AND OUR IDOLATRY IS VERY UNIQUE IN OUR DAY BECAUSE WE WORSHIP OURSELVES. WE WORSHIP MAN. WHETHER WE REALIZE IT OR NOT, WE'RE WORSHIPING OURSELVES, THE THINGS THAT WE'VE CREATED, THE THINGS WE'VE MADE WITH OUR HANDS. WHETHER IT'S A TELEVISION SET OR A NEW AUTOMOBILE, MATERIALISM. ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BECOME GODS AND GODDESSES. SEX HAS BECOME A GODDESS JUST AS MUCH AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF EPHESUS OR IN THE DAYS OF ROME. THESE ARE THE MODERN GODS. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IDOLATRY, THOSE THAT COMMIT IT, ""SHALL HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE ""WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE: ""WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH,"" IN REVELATION  21:8. GOD HATES IDOLATRY. AND THEN THE THIRD THING WHICH MAY KEEP SOME OF YOU FROM CHRIST IS WORLDLINESS. ""FOR WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED IF HE SHALL GAIN ""THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL? ""OR WHAT SHALL A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL?"" SAID JESUS IN MATTHEW 16. THERE ARE MANY OF YOU THAT ARE SELLING YOUR SOUL, YOUR ETERNAL SPIRIT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THIS WORLD. BUT JESUS SAID, SUPPOSE YOU GOT ALL THE OIL OF THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL THE GOLD IN SOUTH AFRICA, ALL THE DIAMONDS IN HOLLAND, ALL THE WEALTH OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND YOU HAD IT ALL, ALL THE MUSIC, ALL THE CULTURE, ALL THE PHILOSOPHY, ALL THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE WORLD, YOU HAD IT ALL AND LOST YOUR SOUL? IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT. AND YET, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR SOUL FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IT. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT TO HAVE MONEY. NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE DOES GOD CONDEMN A WEALTHY MAN UNLESS HE MISUSES IT OR UNLESS HE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY. THEN HE'S CONDEMNED. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, ""KNOW YE NOT ""THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE WORLD IS ENMITY WITH GOD? ""WHOSOEVER THEREFORE WILL BE A FRIEND OF THE WORLD ""IS THE ENEMY OF GOD."" NOW WHAT DOES THAT WORD ""WORLD"" MEAN? IT'S COSMOS , IT MEANS A WORLD SYSTEM DOMINATED BY EVIL. THAT EVIL PART OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEM IN WHICH WE LIVE. FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT MEANS ENMITY WITH GOD. AND GOD SAYS, ""COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND BE YE SEPARATE ""SAITH THE LORD AND TOUCH NOT THE UNCLEAN THING."" WORLDLINESS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MEANT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT PEOPLE HAD WITH THEIR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. NOW PERHAPS YOU SAW THOSE HUGE PICTURES ON TELEVISION A FEW MONTHS AGO OF SOME FORTY WHALES, WHO FOR SOME UNKNOWN BIOLOGICAL REASON BEACHED THEMSELVES AND DIED. THEY LEFT THEIR LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR ONE OF DEATH AND DIED. AND MANY OF YOU HAVE LEFT THE ENVIRONMENT OF LIVING IN THE SCRIPTURES AND LIVING FOR GOD, AND GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD AND YOUR SOUL IS DEAD TOWARD GOD. IT'S LIKE THE LEMMING IN SCANDINAVIA. THEY BAND TOGETHER. AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WALK DOWN INTO THE OCEAN AND DIE. YOU DELIBERATELY BRING ON YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL DEATH. YOU PROMOTE YOUR OWN ETERNAL DEATH BY GOING WITH THE EVILS OF THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU. AND THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU SQUEEZES YOU INTO ITS MOLD AND IT BECOMES A HINDRANCE TO YOU COMING TO JESUS CHRIST. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE WRONG THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WORLD; THE LUST AND THE GREED AND THE HATE AND THE PREJUDICE AND THE MATERIALISM PART OF THE WORLD THAT'S WRONG, YOU HAVE TO TURN FROM WHEN YOU COME TO CHRIST. AND THAT'S THE REASON IT'S SO HARD TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE MODERN DAY. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I'M NOT GOING TO FOOL YOU. I WOULD THINK IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO BE A CHRISTIAN RIGHT NOW IN MODERN AMERICA OR MODERN WESTERN WORLD THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD. YOU SEE TO BE A CHRISTIAN IN SOME PARTS OF THE ORIENT OR SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO REALLY STAND FOR CHRIST AND YOU HAVE TO SUFFER. BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S NO SUFFERING AND NO PHYSICAL PERSECUTION IT'S RATHER EASY JUST TO SLIDE ALONG, REALLY NOT KNOWING CHRIST. CALLING YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN BUT NOT REALLY BEING A CHRISTIAN, NOT A NEW TESTAMENT CHRISTIAN. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT HAVE GONE TO CHURCH ALL THEIR LIVES AND BEEN BAPTIZED AND CONFIRMED BUT STILL NOT KNOWING CHRIST. AND THEN ANOTHER OBSTACLE ARE SECRET SINS THE BIBLE SAYS. THE PSALMIST PRAYED, ""CLEANSE THOU ME FROM SECRET THOUGHTS."" AND PAUL WROTE TO THE ROMANS, ""THE DAY WHEN GOD SHALL JUDGE THE SECRETS OF MEN ""BY JESUS CHRIST."" YOU CAN KEEP NO SECRETS FROM GOD. YOUR FRIENDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW. AND GOD HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THEM. IT'S LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK ON TELEVISION. I THINK I'VE SEEN IT ONCE, MAYBE TWICE. BUT I READ ABOUT IT. AND IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY, IT'S TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PERSON INSIDE OF HIM, ALWAYS. AND PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN BATTLING WITH THE HIDDEN MAN IN YOUR HEART WITH YOUR SECRET SINS. CONFESS THEM TO CHRIST TONIGHT. COME TO THE CROSS AND BRING THOSE SECRETS OF YOUR HEART AND LAY THEM BEFORE HIM AND SAY, ""LORD, HERE THEY ARE. ""I SURRENDER."" AND THEN SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ANOTHER THING THAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM CHRIST. ""THERE IS A GENERATION,"" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THAT ARE PURE IN THEIR OWN EYES ""AND YET THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WASHED FROM THEIR FILTHINESS."" PURE IN OUR OWN EYES. PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE BAD. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE SINNING AND BREAKING GOD'S LAWS. THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST, SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOW WE'VE SEEN THE OBSTACLES, LET'S LOOK AT JESUS. IT'S A PERSONAL CALL. JESUS TURNS TO ZACCHAEUS AND CALLS HIM BY NAME. HE SEES ZACCHAEUS UP THE TREE. YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS HAD CLIMBED A SYCAMORE TREE AND WAS OUT ON THE LIMB, SITTING THERE WATCHING JESUS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST HATED MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST SINFUL MAN IN TOWN HEARS HIS NAME CALLED BY THE GREAT PROPHET, JESUS. AND JESUS SAYS, ""ZACCHAEUS."" CAN YOU IMAGE HOW STARTLED HE WAS THAT OUT OF ALL THAT CROWD AND THOSE RELIGIOUS LEADERS, HE, THE WORST SINNER IN TOWN, CALLED BY HIS NAME? THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS IS THE GOOD SHEPHERD. HE CALLETH HIS OWN SHEEP BY NAME AND LEADETH THEM. IN GENESIS WE READ THAT GOD CAME IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN PERSONALLY TO CALL ADAM. HE SAID, ""ADAM, ADAM, WHERE ART THOU?"" AND LATER HE CALLED ABRAHAM. HE SAID, ""ABRAHAM, JACOB, MOSES, JOSHUA, GIDEON, SAMUEL, ""DAVID, SOLOMON."" HE CALLED THEM ALL BY NAME. ""ISAIAH, JEREMIAH, EZEKIEL, DANIEL."" HE CALLED THEM BY NAME. AND THEN WHEN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST CAME HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES BY NAME. HE WENT DOWN BY THE SEASHORE AND HE CALLED OUT, ""SIMON PETER, ""ANDREW, JAMES, JOHN."" AND FROM THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM ANOTHER MAN, LIKE ZACCHAEUS, A TAX GATHERER, ""MATTHEW, COME AND FOLLOW ME."" AND HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED JESUS IMMEDIATELY. AND ON THE DAMASCUS ROAD, HE SAID, ""SAUL, SAUL, SAUL, WHY DO YOU PERSECUTE ME?"" AND ON THE ISLE OF PATMOS, HE SAID, ""JOHN."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. WHAT IS YOUR NAME; JIM, MARY, SUSIE, PETER? HE CALLED YOU BY NAME TONIGHT. HE KNOWS YOUR NAME. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MARY, GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT ""AND COME AND RECEIVE ME TONIGHT. ""I WANT TO COME INTO YOUR HOUSE AND INTO YOUR HEART."" ""JIM, YOU NEED ME. ""YOU KNOW YOU NEED ME TO HELP YOU, TO FORGIVE YOU, ""TO TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN. ""GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. HE LOOKED UP IN THE TREE AND SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS."" AND IT WAS AN URGENT CALL. HE SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS, MAKE HASTE, HURRY. ""WE DON'T HAVE LONG."" AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS TO YOU. HURRY, MAKE HASTE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO CHRIST, COME NOW. YOU MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT LIKE THIS. NOWHERE DOES THE BIBLE PROMISE TOMORROW YOU CAN BE SAVED. IT'S TODAY; TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. NOW IS THE ACCEPTED TIME. THERE MAY NOT BE A TOMORROW FOR YOU. THERE'S A LITTLE VERSE IN YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT SOMETIMES I MISS WHEN I HEAR IT SUNG. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. ""OH LORD OUR GOD, ARISE ON THEE OUR HOPES WE FIX. ""GOD SAVE US ALL."" TONIGHT THAT WOULD BE MY PRAYER FOR YOU. GOD SAVE US ALL. AND THAT'S WHAT THE LORD JESUS CAME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH IS LOST."" TODAY HE'S URGENTLY CALLING YOU BY NAME. AND IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL CALL BECAUSE ZACCHAEUS DID MAKE HASTE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE DIDN'T WAIT TO CLIMB DOWN THE TREE. HE JUMPED. AND D.L. MOODY, THE EVANGELIST OF THE LAST CENTURY, SAID THAT ZACCHAEUS WAS CONVERTED FROM THE LIMB TO THE GROUND. AND I EXPECT THAT'S ABOUT TRUE. THE RICH YOUNG RULER CAME TO JESUS. HE FELL DOWN BEFORE JESUS. HE WAS RUNNING TO JESUS. MAKING HASTE TO GET TO JESUS. AND HE GOT TO JESUS, BUT HE COULDN'T PAY THE PRICE. AND HE WAS LOST EVEN THOUGH JESUS LOVED HIM AND JESUS TRIED AND JESUS TALKED WITH HIM AND GAVE HIM PRECIOUS TIME. YET THAT YOUNG MAN NEVER CAME TO JESUS. BUT ZACCHAEUS, THE GREAT SINNER, DID COME TO JESUS. AND JESUS WENT TO ZACCHAEUS' HOME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK JESUS PROBABLY TOOK MATTHEW WITH HIM. AND I EXPECT THAT MATTHEW AND ZACCHAEUS GOT INTO A CONVERSATION LATE INTO THE NIGHT. AND MATTHEW TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. HOW HE HAD BEEN ALSO A TAX GATHERER AND HOW HE HAD BEEN A SINNER AND HOW JESUS HAD CALLED HIM BY NAME. AND HE SAID, ""FOLLOW ME."" AND MATTHEW SAID, ""I GOT UP RIGHT THEN AND FOLLOWED HIM ""AND I'VE NEVER REGRETTED ONE MINUTE OF IT. ""HE CHANGED MY LIFE, HE'S GIVEN ME ASSURANCE. ""HE'S BLESSED MY FAMILY. ""HE'S BROUGHT OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. ""OH, I'D DIE FOR HIM. ""I'VE GIVEN HIM MY LIFE."" AND ZACCHAEUS HEARD THAT. AND I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM THAT NIGHT, ""YOU KNOW ZACCHAEUS, ""IF YOU COME TO CHRIST, IF YOU COME TO JESUS, ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME RESTITUTION. ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE WAY OF LIVING. ""AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECLARE OPENLY ""YOUR ALLEGIANCE FOR JESUS CHRIST."" WE'RE TO BE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT OF IT. WE LIVE IN TWO WORLDS. WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD, BUT WE'RE ALSO CITIZENS OF ANOTHER WORLD, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. AND OUR FIRST ALLEGIANCE IS ALWAYS TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. YES, I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WHAT WAS THE RESULT? THE RESULT WAS THAT ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST. NOW RECEIVING CHRIST INVOLVES AN ACT OF FAITH BEYOND MERE HUMAN REASON. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVETH NOT ""THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD ""FOR THEY'RE FOOLISHNESS UNTO HIM. ""NEITHER CAN HE KNOW THEM BECAUSE ""THEY'RE SPIRITUALLY DISCERNED."" IN OTHER WORDS, A NATURAL PERSON LIKE YOU JUST CANNOT COME AND REASON HIS WAY TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. YOU CANNOT REASON YOUR WAY TO CHRIST. I DON'T IMAGINE ZACCHAEUS SAT DOWN AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE PHILOSOPHY AND ALL THE THEOLOGICAL DEBATES ABOUT JESUS. HE JUST JOYFULLY RECEIVED HIM BY FAITH. SIMPLY LIKE A LITTLE CHILD. AND JESUS RECEIVED HIM AND FORGAVE HIM. YOU SEE CHRIST IS KNOCKING ON OUR HEART'S DOOR TONIGHT. HE'S ASKING PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO RECEIVE HIM. AND THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SAYING, THEY ACCUSED HIM BY SAYING, ""THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS."" ARE YOU A SINNER? HAVE YOU BROKEN GOD'S LAW? I'M A SINNER. ARE YOU? SURE YOU ARE. HE RECEIVETH SINNERS. ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL THING THAT HE RECEIVETH SINNERS? AND WHEN I STAND, AND IF THEY SHOULD ASK ME AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN WHEN I DIE, ""WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?"" I'M GOING TO SAY, ""I'M HERE BY THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD ""BECAUSE OF WHAT JESUS CHRIST DID ON THE CROSS. ""I'M NOT HERE BY ANY GOOD WORKS BILLY GRAHAM EVER DID."" I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PREACHED IN A BIG STADIUM FULL OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS TONIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE READ THE BIBLE. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PRAYED. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN WIFE AND FIVE CHRISTIAN CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD. I'M A SINNER. I DESERVE JUDGMENT, I DESERVE HELL. I'M GOING BECAUSE OF CHRIST. AND I HAVE RECEIVED CHRIST. I'VE LET HIM COME INTO MY HEART. AND I'VE COME TO THE CROSS. HE'S FORGIVEN MY SIN. I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. I KNOW I'M SAVED TONIGHT. I KNOW WHERE I'VE COME FROM. I KNOW WHY I'M HERE. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. AND IF HE SHOULD COME TONIGHT, I'M READY. DO YOU KNOW THAT? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS. ""BUT AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, ""TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME SONS OF GOD ""EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ON HIS NAME."" YOU RECEIVE HIM AND LET HIM COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND YOU'LL FIND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE JOYFUL. WITHOUT CHRIST TO FILL THAT EMPTY VOID IN YOUR LIFE NOTHING ELSE SATISFIES. SEX DOESN'T DO IT. DRUGS DOESN'T DO IT. POWER, POPULARITY, ALL OF THAT IS NOTHING. CHRIST IS EVERYTHING. AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE CHRIST YOU'RE READY TO LIVE HERE AND NOW. LIFE WITH A CAPITAL L WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR SAVIOR. YES, ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST JOYFULLY. AND NOTICE ANOTHER THING, ZACCHAEUS OPENLY CONFESSED CHRIST, PUBLICLY. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF ALL OF HIS FRIENDS IN THE WHOLE TOWN AND HE SAID, ""I'VE BEEN WRONG, I'VE BEEN A SINNER. ""I'M READY TO RESTORE EVERYTHING I EVER DID IF NECESSARY. ""WHATEVER IT TAKES. ""FROM NOW ON I'M FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST. ""HE IS MY LORD AND HE IS MY SAVIOR. ""HE CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE ME IN THIS TOWN OF JERICHO."" HE CAME TO HALIFAX IN THE FORM OF THIS CRUSADE TO SEEK AND TO SAVE YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME WHILE THERE'S TIME."" BECAUSE YOU SEE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER DENIETH THE SON, THE SAME HATH NOT THE FATHER. ""HE THAT CONFESSED THE SON OPENLY ""HATH THE FATHER ALSO."" ALSO THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER SHALL CONFESS THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD ""DWELLETH IN HIM AND HE IN GOD."" AND JESUS SAID, ""IF YOU DENY ME BEFORE MEN."" IF YOU DENY ME PUBLICLY; ""I'LL NOT CONFESS YOU ""BEFORE MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN."" YOU SEE JESUS CHRIST HUNG ON THE CROSS PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, DYING, BLEEDING FOR YOU. AND HE ASKS YOU TO PUBLICLY RECEIVE HIM. AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO THAT IN A MOMENT. THERE'RE THREE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO. FIRST, LISTEN TO THIS SO YOU CAN NEVER STAND AT THE JUDGMENT AND SAY, ""I NEVER KNEW."" FIRST, YOU MUST REPENT OF YOUR SIN. HOW DO YOU REPENT? THE WORD REPENT MEANS TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. IT MEANS TO TURN. YOU'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION IN YOUR LIFE, YOU TURN AROUND AND START IN A NEW DIRECTION. NOW, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TURN BY YOURSELF. IF FACT YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO SAY, ""LORD, HELP ME TO TURN, ""HELP ME TO REPENT."" IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LET CHRIST COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR WHOLE PATTERN OF LIVING, YOUR LIFESTYLE, EVERYTHING, IF NECESSARY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING, BY FAITH YOU RECEIVE HIM. NOW THAT WORD FAITH MAY CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE. IT MEANS THAT YOU COMMIT, THAT YOU SURRENDER YOUR TOTAL LIFE  TO JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER GOD, YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER RELIGION. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANYTHING BUT JESUS CHRIST AND HIM ALONE TO SAVE YOU. THAT'S FAITH, TOTAL COMMITMENT TO CHRIST. AND THEN THIRDLY, YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW HIM. YOU'RE WILLING TO BE HIS DISCIPLE. NOW THE WORD DISCIPLE MEANS LEARNER OR DISCIPLINE. IT MEANS DISCIPLINED LEARNING. YOU'RE FOLLOWING HIM. GROWING IN THE GRACE AND KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BY STUDYING THE BIBLE, BY PRAYER, BY WITNESSING, BY ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH. YOU SAY, ""WELL, BILLY, YOU KNOW MOST OF THOSE THINGS ""I'M ALREADY DOING."" BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST? ARE YOU SURE OF IT? IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, IF YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN THAT CHRIST IS IN YOUR HEART TONIGHT AND THAT YOUR SIN IS FORGIVEN, HE'S CALLING YOU BY NAME. HE SEES YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE AND COME."" I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT RIGHT NOW, HUNDREDS OF YOU FROM EVERYWHERE AS WE'VE SEEN EVERY NIGHT. GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME AND STAND IN FRONT. AND SAY BY COMING, ""I WANT TO COME TO THE CROSS ""BY FAITH TONIGHT AND I WANT MY SINS FORGIVEN. ""I WANT TO KNOW THAT I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. ""I WANT TO KNOW I'M GOING TO HEAVEN."" YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW, QUICKLY AND STAND HERE. IF YOU'RE WITH FRIENDS OR RELATIVES THEY'LL WAIT. AND AFTER YOU COME, I'M GOING TO SAY A WORD TO YOU AND HAVE A PRAYER WITH YOU. AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME LITERATURE TO HELP YOU IN YOUR CHRISTIAN LIFE. AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND JOIN YOUR FRIENDS. BUT I'M GOING TO ASK NO ONE TO LEAVE THE STADIUM NOW AT THIS HOLY MOMENT. EVERYONE IN AN ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY COMING. YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW TOO. GOD IS CALLING YOU BY NAME. JESUS IS LOOKING IN YOUR DIRECTION. AND HE KNOWS YOUR HEART AND HE SAYS, ""COME."" YOU GET UP AND COME QUICKLY.
