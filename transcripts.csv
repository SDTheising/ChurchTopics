NTQUJxUbpiM,"so you're driving down the street and you get hit with this fear thing about the doctor's report or about some issue at work but instead of yielding to the fear you take the stuff that's been thrown at you you use it as fuel and you begin to sing the new song that actually brings about the new day because in that new song God himself comes and he destroys the powers that have been set against you for your destruction [Applause] thanks thank you thanks thanks thanks love you thanks well I love you too we just still got to do that group hug one of these days an old guy was working out at the gym an old guy was working out at the gym when he spotted a young lady who walked in and he asked his trainer standing next to him what machine should I use to impress that girl over there the trainer looked at him up and down and said I'd recommend the ATM machine in the [Applause] lobby that's funny that's funny somebody talked this week about it's in Mark chapter 6 where Jesus had his disciples and he wanted to take them to a deserted place and if I were to water my yard and there was water all over the place you would come look at it and say it's been watered because I put water on it so what is a deserted place it has desserts do you not see that in the word I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the scripture says it's a deserted Place amen I'm sticking with it that's my interpretation right there open your Bibles to Isaiah that's that's the that's the revised passion translation right there the Rev I'll have to tell Brian tonight when he comes open your Bibles to uh Psalms excuse me to Isaiah 42 I was blessed uh this morning with the passage that Eric opened the meeting up with and and while it's not verbatim in this lesson it does help to set the stage uh Eric read this morning out of Psalms 24 where there's the question who is this king of glory and the the statement that's made is lift up your heads oh you Gates and the king of glory will come in lift up your heads oh you Gates it's it's a strange metaphor because you know we don't see heads on top of gates and yet there's this uh there's this unusual picture and it's actually you can't always use uh the same uh wording or the same subject throughout scripture it doesn't all sometimes you actually bend the the real intention of scripture but I think I I really think this is a consistent theme throughout scripture so I'm going to play off it for a moment says lift up your heads or you gates in Isaiah 60 Gates were praise in Revelation the gates were made out of pearls pearls are formed through irritation the gates of praise are formed in our life when we go against circumstances and glorify Jesus anyway something is shaped in us so here's this unusual picture it says lift up your heads the lifting of the head has everything in the world to do with our countenance the Bible says he's the glory and the lifter of our head lifting of the head is not um to give us some kind of a psychological Edge lifting of the head ch changes what we see Jesus wanted his disciples to see the Harvest fields and so he told them lift up your eyes and see the fields are wi under Harvest lift up look up before you look down and you'll see things differently there's something about changing the countenance lifting our heads lifting our our our it's a it's a look of anticipation where we set our eyes on the Lord and there's something about setting the eyes of our heart on Heavenly things in attitude in countenance in conduct so here's this unusual passage lift up your heads oh you Gates and the king of glory will come in the word gate this subject of gate I should say in the Psalms God says the gates of Zion are his eternal Dwelling Place he lives in a gate that makes no sense unless you see gate as praise and he inhabits the Praises of his people do you see the connections here so this invitation is like this lift up your countenance before you get the answer you need on you're not lifting your countenance because you got the Breakthrough you're lifting your countenance and you're giving him thanks and praise in spite of circumstances you're willing to let the the gate be formed in you that says I will praise Him continuously regardless of circumstances and so we lift up the countenance as a lifestyle of anticipation of Grace and in that place we give him praise and what does it say that is the gate that he comes through anyone can lift the head after the king of glory has come now I understand he's the merciful one he is the one who comes in he wipes away our tears he comes in brings Comfort he brings healing to the broken that's the merciful god that comes to serve but in this passage he comes as the king of glory and when he shows up as the king of glory he comes as the triumphant one he doesn't come to minister to the broken toenail he doesn't come to fix the disappointment he comes because Victory is established and is at hand and so when we see this lift up your heads are your Gates he's the glory he's the lifter of my head in that context regardless of circumstances I will give him praise in fact I will use the circumstances to fuel my praise and what happens that becomes the very gate that he comes through as the king of glory now Isaiah uh 42 is uh personally a really really uh favorite passage I've taught on it many times I think it's been a long long time though um and uh and so I it it uh was just in my heart this week and so I wanted to share with with you so Isaiah 42 we'll start with verse 10 and we're going to read through verse 13 sing to the Lord a new song and his praise from the ends of the Earth you who go down to the Sea all that is in it you Coast lands you inhabitants of them let the Wilderness and its City lift up their voices or their voice The Villages that Kadar inhabits let the inhabitants of Sila sing Let Them shout from the top of the mountains let them give glory to the Lord and his praise to the coastlands now here's God's response the Lord will go forth like a mighty man he will stir up his Zeal like a man of war he shall cry out yes alow shout aloud he shall Prevail against his enemies I think it's probably obvious why I love this portion so much and maybe many of you have it underlined already in your Bible is here's this um there's this incredible moment in time where the people of God are exhorted to sing loudly to the Lord and the result is God himself stir himself up as a man of war to go forth and to do exploits on our behalf how many you know God and the devil are not at war with each other uh the devil doesn't stand a chance uh that's that's not a war that's not a contest I mean the Lord all he has to do is Blink and poof you know the devil's chrisy crator there's no there's no contest there's there's no contest there whatsoever it's not as though that God is perfect good and the devil is perfect evil and there's this ying and yang War that's not true God is God period the devil and powers of Darkness were defeated through a man Jesus the son of God who became a man and defeated him on our our behalf because we missed our chance y that is the truth but so Jesus came the son of man and uh and and brought a a a end to the power of death disease torment Etc the powers of Darkness back to the subject here's this great passage of scripture that says Sing a new song to the Lord and then he responds in a military fashion and brings about Victory on our behalf I've always I've always been fascinated with this thought that you and I could sit here in the middle of this room and just enjoy the peace of God and just enjoy his presence and not a care in the world whatever I brought in is no longer with me you know the issues the baggage whatever I'm just here in his presence and I just love him so much and I give him praise and I give him thanks and all the while I'm just enjoying his presence while he's just knocking a snot out of the powers of darkness and when it's all over he comes back and he calls me me a mighty man of war I go when when was I in war oh that praise thing you did this is I I I translated it for you and I just I just kicked you know the devil around for a while on your behalf you know it's it's I love that picture it may not do anything for you but it does a lot for me Warfare I is I it makes me nervous that Warfare could easily become the reason for people's praise it cannot be that way it's just a wonderful side benefit it's not the reason we give God honor the reason we give God honor is his worth that is the reason it is the entire basis of Praise is who he is here's this phrase to sing to the Lord a new song I love uh I I I love the new songs I love the songs that our teams write for us and the songs we learned around the world but when it says a new song it's not talking about sit down write a nice song and then we'll sing it it's it's more referring to a spontaneous response to the Lord in the book of Ephesians there is a verse that uh where Paul talks about um singing making melody in your heart to the Lord and he and he and he uses this phrase Psalms hymns and spiritual songs Psalms are are are scripture songs hymns are the songs we write they don't have to be 100 years old to qualify as a hymn there are songs that we write they can be written today you know John and Charles Wesley the Great uh um Methodist leaders uh John was the great preacher Charles was the hymnwriter and the whole basis for the writing hym was hymns or hers writing hymns sorry that's that's bad Apostles and their wives Epistles yeah yeah never mind um the whole reason for their writing hymns was to teach theology so that the people would sing truth they would become that I I met with some of our worship team years years ago and I I I remember telling them I asked them the question I said what do you want the church to look like in 10 years write songs about it now and we'll sing our way into it there something something happens when we capture the heart of God the theme of God in a song so when it talks about Psalms that's out of the scripture hymns that's something we write spiritual songs are the spontaneous we don't sing them to be recorded we don't sing them so that we can sing them to Mom send them to mop and show us how good we can do you know it's not it's not a song that's for anyone else it's for the audience of one it's that which is honest it's raw it doesn't have to rhyme it doesn't have to don't even have to carry a tune it's beautiful God likes the way you sing your neighbor may not but God likes the way you sing and that's all that matters it's for the audience of one and so that Spontaneous Song is an important part of our life as Believers and um he here's this uh the Spontaneous Song is either a praise song to him it can include intercessory uh prayer as well as you'll see in scripture but it's a spontaneous song of praise to him or it's what we refer to in scripture as the song of the Lord that's where the Lord himself is singing over people and that would take on more of a prophetic type song where uh a message is given to a group of people the reason I mention this uh as a spontaneous song is that all of us probably all of us most of us anyway have a great desire to increase in our sensitivity to the Holy Spirit to be ready to do whatever he's doing I want to just sense the heart of God in a matter I want to move easily with him I don't you know I don't want him to have to hit me over the head with a 2x4 to get my attention so he can then direct me you know as I I don't want he I don't want to portray him that way but you get my my point is there's some days at the end end of the day I look back and I go man I was so caught up on my agenda today that I missed all these opportunities that you opened up for me and I didn't even see them and I don't like that and so I I want that that that continuous sensitivity to the voice of God to the presence of God so that he he can just breathe slightly and I catch what he's saying what he's doing how do you stay in tune to that kind of Lifestyle I think there's two things you can do proactively to build that sense of awareness the first one is to pray in tongues pray a lot Paul said he prayed more than all and uh and the word he used there is I pray more than than all of you combined in other words he was saying listen if you knew what I was going through you'd understand why I pray in tongues all the time and and really that was the whole case is that spiritual language it's that it's learning to stay connected to the holy spirit it's not it's not something taking over our body it's a it's the willful use of a prayer language that God gives us if you don't have just ask him because he's really generous with this gift it goes to every anyone who wants it just sweat to get it it comes much easier so this gift this praying in the spirit is a huge part of our life it's supposed to be a huge part of our life because it's the one gift given that is for us all the other gifts are enabling us to serve well the people around us but praying in the spirit is something that edifies and strengthens us what does it do it connects me to the spontaneous because it bypasses my understanding I don't know what I'm praying after a while you start to you start to pick up you start praying in the spirit but you start picking up the kinds of areas that God is moving your heart in you start Discerning things but what's happening is the Lord is he's training us how to live in the spontaneous not so that we avoid Reason Not So that we avoid uh uh understanding or intellectual approach to things I think that's vital I think we're supposed to have understanding of things but it doesn't do me a whole lot of good to have great understanding and not hear his voice not be able to be moved with with the presence in the spirit of God so that's one the second one is this Spontaneous Song is say you drive down the street and you just spontaneously sing out of whatever season you're in whatever moment you're in maybe it's a crisis that you have going on maybe there's this maybe you've received a doctor's report that's really a bad report you don't sing the report you sing the answer to the report you you sing the solution you sing you sing the praises to God in the middle of it you know years ago uh dick Mills was such a dear friend of s and I remember uh he he told us this story once he said he was just really being harassed by the devil it's just really one of those you know one of those extreme seasons in his life and extreme moments so he went into a room he got two chairs he had the chairs face each other and Dick sat in one and he said Satan sit down I'm going to praise God and you're going to watch I love that I love that that whole thing that listen in the middle of of whatever is going on I have determined to take what what the enemy has meant for evil and I'm going to use that as the fuel to exalt him in his greatness because there's not one problem that I am facing in Life or could ever face that he has not already purchased the answer for I don't come to God begging for breakthrough as though he needed to do something he already took care of something all I'm doing is aligning my heart to receive what he's already purchased and put in my account and so this whole idea of singing a new song is huge I love this portion of scripture but it's possible for us to miss the context so I want you to go to verse n of Isaiah 42 verse 9 says behold the former things have come to pass the new things I declare before they spring forth I tell you of them look at that verse again behold the former things have come to pass the new things I declare before they spring forth I tell you of them why is that important well first of all if you look at the previous chapter it's just Israel's in a mess again and they just got this they got this they got this bad habit of worshiping God one day and worshiping you know some false god another day and so they got this they got this Spirit of dumb all over them and they're doing the confused thing and there's this cry I think it's in there if I remember right I was glancing over to this morning uh if I remember right there's I think it's twice in chapter 41 they are basically asking the Lord to please do a new thing please do do something new please we're ready do something new anybody ready for God to do something new we're ready for you to do something new so here the Lord in the first part of Isaiah 42 he sends the Messiah the answer with breakthrough if you read through the chapter you see he's opening blind eyes he comes in the spirit of God so here Jesus comes with this mantle of breakthrough and now the Lord stands before the people says all right the old things are over new things begin his very next phrase sing to the Lord a new song yeah that's good the new song brings the new day come on it's not hard to write an inspirational piece after you won the lottery after you you won the Super Bowl after some great dream of yours F was fulfilled you finally found the man or the woman of your dreams or whatever it might be you finally were able to have a child and you couldn't those are wonderful write those songs they need to be sung sing them sit in your living room and sing those songs but this one's different this is Israel coming through hell asking for a new day and Jesus says all right the past is over new things began he says all right sing a new song it's interesting in Psalms 40 you guys doing all right here all right Psalm I think it's Psalms 40 he says sing to the Lord a new song in the very next phrase says and the Earth will fear the Lord that's a that's a strange Connection in subjects you know sing to the Lord a new song and there's going to be a whole bunch of people get saved it's not it's not like let's get a Stadium fill it with 100,000 people then we'll have Chris come up here and sing a new song and then we'll have a lot of people saved it it's not saying that it's not saying let's get the worship team up here to sing some brand new prophetic song lot of people's get getting saved he's not saying he's talking about lifesty St in the living room in your bathroom driving your car it's the song that nobody hears but what's happening did you see what happens in response to verse 10 the Lord arouses himself as a man of war so you're driving down the street and you get hit with this fear thing about the doctor's report or about some issue at work they're laying off people oh no what if I lose my job you start get having that stuff going on but instead of yielding to the fear you take the stuff that's been thrown at you you use it as fuel and it becomes the lyrics of a song and you begin to sing the new song that actually brings about the new day why does it bring about the new day because in that new song God himself stir himself up as a man of war and he comes and he destroys the powers that have been set against you for your destruction that's why things change how does that affect your neighbor how does that affect the city how does that affect the nation it's easy the Lord WS havoc on the powers of Darkness that have influence over the thought life and value system of a community so picture this here we are as the people of God spread all through the community just throughout the day continuously throughout the day just lifting up the new song the spontaneous song God we give you thanks we give you thanks that you are turning this into a city of great Prosperity we bless you for what you're doing God we thank you Lord that unemployment will be a thing of the past we praise you God as the god of abundance that you bring healing and cancer is being destroyed from our city and we you just take these things you just begin to sing them what happens the Lord starts wreaking havoc on those powers of the a that have influence of the thought life what happens the people around you start having clear thoughts for the first time in their life that's why people turn to the Lord because they can see this is obvious yeah this is obvious this one who gave himself for me is the only one with the right to rule my life [Applause] that's I uh had this little b with sickness here recently and I talked about it last Sunday night so if you have any interest in I I don't like replaying the story but uh but I think it's available online somewhere if you want to hear it but I I got I got to where I couldn't eat I mean I I I just I was sick sick sick and um I I was um I ended up having a surgical procedure and I'm doing really good my health is just returning I'm just you know I'm eating meat which is really the main thing the main testimony is that things have died to keep me alive and I'm okay with that I'm I'm all right with that totally over in fact more things are going to die so my strength is returning I'm this is my first Sunday uh back in the morning to actually speak so and I'm doing all three services so we see how I do that but I'm doing well but um the you know just in in being just sick and uh and doing so poorly it was a gift to be able to sit at home in my recliner and just to read and just review the promises of God to review the prophetic words over my life and it's a it's a regular part of my life but I had extra time for it and uh Benny and I would take communion most every day together and we would uh we would just take communion and just give thanks for divine health and and it wasn't forced it wasn't like no I don't want to but I'm going to just grit It Up by faith no it was there's something so rich in the presence of God that rests upon you the peace that passes understanding comes to us when we don't demand to understand and that that that comes upon on you there's such a Grace in it to do right things and good things and so we would share in communion and I would pray over one of the elements Benny would pray with the other and this just a regular a regular part of our of our our life and I I remember um I remember there there there came a point where I could no longer eat anything in fact I I went uh 10 days without even uh drinking water I couldn't drink anything I couldn't they just kept me plugged up to uh plugged into intervenous feeding which is you can live a while on that so that worked well for me so um and we I couldn't take communion but she would take it for me and uh she would come next to the bed and she would take and we would pray together and and what we gave thanks for the most was just just the Divine Health the life that God had given us the victory that he had given us you know you know you don't have to beg him for what he already bought and paid for and put in your account what you want to do is just just condition your heart to celebrate what's there and uh you know I I have more questions than I've ever had but as I've I've stated before I will never sacrifice what I know about the goodness of God on the altar of human reasoning so that I have an explanation for why something happened I I don't need an explanation I have a person who is with me and there's something about facing difficulty and not losing your peace that actually annoys the devil to Pieces there's something about even experiencing loss or having things that go on that just you just can't explain you don't have a slot for I don't need a slot for it I have a person that I get to walk with and there's something about becoming the people that just have said this is the way I'm doing in life in any and every situation I will give him thanks I will give him praise I will take the very weapons that the enemy uses against me and much like David took Goliath's sword and cut off Goliath's head so I will take the very things that the enemy has throwing my way and they will become the lyrics of my offering of praise to God God I give you I give you thanks for divine health I give you thanks for abundance and breakthrough we would just Delight to together in our family oh you know in those kinds of moments and there's many of you you've gone through things way worse than I've ever gone through I I get that but this was a a a pretty CH big challenging situation for me I remember you know you you don't you don't lay there not being able to eat or drink or function uh really you don't you don't lay there wishing you would have written another book you don't you don't lay there thinking oh if I only would have preached in one more City or if I would have gone of this nation all you think about is family friends that's it it's it's people it's the gift of being able to serve Jesus with friends with family it's looking at my kids my grandkids it's it's it's seeing it's just seeing the rich rich life in God it's just it's real tough real tough to get depressed when you see blessing everywhere you look you know it's just you know you can you can look at some things that are unsettled unanswered but but they don't fuel me they don't fuel me because I because I'm a I'm a I'm a singer of new songs and a singer of new songs just takes the information that comes and gives it as an offering and celebrates and declares his greatness I honestly have tried to live that for just on as long as I can remember but there are you know there are moments there things that happen to us that just are really tough and it kind of challenges you at a new level and so the Lord just kind of peels back the layer of that onion at another level you know and that's what happened for me this last couple months but but I'd like to I'd like to say that the cool thing about this verse is that all my job was was to give him praise and he's the one who fought the Battle it's the most beautiful thing because sometimes the Lord has you in a position where you rest sometimes he has you in a position where you fight I talked about this more clearly last Sunday night I I believe in this I believe the kingdom suffers violence the violent take a force I believe in that the prayer the fasting the yelling the shouting waging Flags chauffeur pouring out oil whatever you got any any Christian toy you have that you think will work let's use it and let's get that thing going and let's just apprehend what's wrong and get it turned around and I'm good I'm good with all of it you know get the trumpets blaring and I mean we've marched all over this property we've marched up and down that street we've waved the flags we've had the horns we've pulled oil I go to my back door to my office and there's oil dripping down the door somebody's been here just praying over I don't know that's it's I'm okay with it though I'm not offended it's just there it's just one of the things that we do use everything you have but there are times where there's not a thing you can use that will bring about a change the only thing you can do is sit down and give thanks let him do this one for you and this is one of those verses this is one of those moments where he says it's the Lord who becomes the warrior and all he did was respond to the brand new song of yielded heart that says I'm going to take this about him and put it in Praise why don't you stand the most amazing thing happened Jesus Jesus was perfect no sin no sin in thought attitude nothing and yet he he took upon himself the punishment that I deserve that you deserve because everybody here we all have sinned we all have fallen short of the glory of God and then the mercy of Jesus comes and Jesus had you in mind he had me in mind and he bore punishment in his own flesh so that we could actually receive what he deserved which is life forever and I know that anytime we have this many people in a room there's always a high chance high probability that we have people here that just you don't have a personal relationship with Jesus you may be tend church every week I don't know you you maybe it's the first time you you've been in a church I it matters not to me the the whole point is is I believe the stage has been set for you to know what it is to be forgiven of sin and to step into eternal life know what it is to have God as your father and to be changed from the inside you can't we can't make ourselves worthy I can't jump through enough Hoops to become clean before God it's an impossible task that's why Jesus died if there was another way to get right before God then he was cruel to require the death of his son if there was another way the only way Jesus died is because there was no other way there's no other way and that offer his offering to you and to me is present right here right now and I want to make sure that everybody in this place is able to leave today with the absolute confidence that number one I've been born again I've been forgiven of sin and God receives me into his family and I want to start life all over again brand new because Jesus has forgiven me and come into my life if that's you if you have never surrendered your life is a term we use where we we really give ourselves to the only one who has a right to rule our life that's Jesus you know the crazy thing is is he rules my life and there's more freedom being ruled by him than there ever was doing what I wanted that's that's it's like this stuff just doesn't make sense but it does and that's the point is I want to give opportunity for everybody here to leave with certainty that Jesus really is your father heavenly father he becomes the one who forgives you and receives you into the family that you have born again if that's if you're in that place and you say Bill I don't want to leave till I know that's a reality for me then I want you just put your hand up and I want to just see where you are I want to make agreement with you right over here I want to make that agreement with you that Jesus will come into your life yeah beautiful anybody else put your hand up real quick I'm just going to wait like a minute so I I'm I'm not going to prolong this but if there's if there's anybody else put you hand up Pro quick I think we had four four people in the first service this morning is wonderful people that come to Christ say I I don't want to leave till I know that I'm right with God anyone else just real quick okay all right we've got a freedom banner and i' uh if you would come down here I've got uh people that I know and trust that will uh pray love on you and pray for you and this is going to be the change of the rest of your life starts today yeah amen beautiful there's anybody else that wants to join come on down Freedom Banner people come on down all right you still owe me five minutes so don't get real ansy now all right I I that's the time right up there you owe me five that's the way I look at it so if you didn't know you owed me I'm letting you know I'm just telling you I want to pray over you because I I I believe there's a Grace for a new song I believe there's a Grace I believe there's I believe there's a Grace and I really want to emphasize this strongly I Eric shared this story bizarre story again this week of of a gal who quit singing as a child until she became a young adult never sang at all because of a comment made to her about her voice when she was a small child and you know it may be that we need that we want certain we do want certain quality on the CDs that we buy and the radios that we listen to and the worship team but that that you sing to the Lord is priceless to him in whatever form you bring it and I want to pray for an anointing literally an anointing on thought an anointing on our life to bring the new song you know why CU I want to see you in a new day it's the new song that brings the new day it's the new song that's given as a continual offering to the Lord that spontaneity that develops in our life for it to become enhanced and strengthened for every single person I I want to hear more and more stories about people were just unusually led to do something something not outside of their character and yet they just believed God and God provided that Miracle that's the lifestyle of a holy spirit-led believer it's not apart from reason it's just according to his reason yes amen all right put your hands in front of you and we'll uh let me just pray over you father I do pray for a Grace a gift to be given for the new song that even those who are not in any way musically inclined that there would be just a musical anointing a an anoint a Grace a presence to sing new songs to you that shape the history of our life and actually impact and affect the city around us bring almost like volcanically from within us prophetically new songs that create new days we ask this for the honor of the name Jesus amen amen"
7c_yxXjQMyI," FROM OUR ARCHIVES...  THE BILLY GRAHAM CLASSICS. [applause] NOW, TONIGHT I WANT YOU TO TURN WITH ME TO THE 19TH CHAPTER  OF LUKE'S GOSPEL, THE 19TH CHAPTER. JESUS IS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO AT THIS POINT  IN SCRIPTURE. AND A BLIND MAN SCREAMED OUT AND SAID, ""JESUS, THOU SON OF DAVID, HAVE MERCY UPON ME."" AND JESUS TOUCHED HIM AND HE WAS HEALED. AND NOW HE'S PASSING RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF JERICHO AND ANOTHER INCIDENT HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME. ""AND JESUS ENTERED AND PASSED THROUGH JERICHO. ""AND, BEHOLD, THERE WAS A MAN NAMED ZACCHAEUS, ""WHICH WAS THE CHIEF AMONG THE PUBLICANS, ""AND HE WAS VERY RICH. ""AND HE SOUGHT TO SEE JESUS WHO HE WAS; ""AND COULD NOT  FOR THE PRESS."" THAT MEANS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, THAT DOESN'T MEAN  THE MEDIA. ""BECAUSE HE WAS LITTLE OF STATURE. ""AND HE RAN BEFORE, AND CLIMBED UP INTO A SYCAMORE TREE ""TO SEE HIM: FOR HE WAS TO PASS THAT WAY. ""AND WHEN JESUS CAME TO THE PLACE, HE LOOKED UP, ""AND SAW HIM, AND SAID TO HIM, ZACCHAEUS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME DOWN; FOR TODAY ""I GOING TO ABIDE  AT YOUR HOUSE. ""AND HE MADE HASTE, AND HE CAME DOWN, ""AND HE RECEIVED HIM JOYFULLY. ""AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY ALL MURMURED, AND SAYING, ""THAT HE WAS GONE TO BE THE GUEST ""WITH A MAN WHO'S A SINNER. ""AND ZACCHAEUS STOOD, AND SAID UNTO THE LORD: ""BEHOLD, LORD, HALF OF ALL MY GOODS ""I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THE POOR; ""AND IF I HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING FROM ANY MAN ""BY FALSE ACCUSATION, I RESTORE FOURFOLD. ""AND JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, ""THIS DAY, THIS DAY ""IS SALVATION COME TO THIS HOUSE, ""FOR AS MUCH AS HE ALSO IS A SON OF ABRAHAM. ""FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST."" THE SON OF MAN IS COME TO SEEK AND SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT THAT ARE LOST. YOU'RE NOT LOST FROM YOUR PARENTS, SO MUCH, OR LOST FROM YOUR FRIENDS. YOU ARE LOST FROM GOD. YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM GOD. AND JESUS HAS COME TO SEEK YOU OUT. AND HE SOUGHT OUT ZACCHAEUS. AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY AS JESUS WAS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO. NOW YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS WAS A PUBLICAN. THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS A TAX GATHERER AND HE WORKED FOR ROME. HE WAS RICH. HE WAS DESPISED. HE WAS A SOCIAL OUTCAST. THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE TAX GATHERERS GATHERING TAXES FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT DOMINATED THEM. AND IF JESUS HAD CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION HE WOULD HAVE NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT ZACCHAEUS. BUT JESUS NEVER CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT ""ON ALL OCCASIONS JESUS MADE OF HIMSELF ""NO REPUTATION."" AND I IMAGINE IT HAD BEEN MANY MONTHS SINCE ANYONE HAD EVER CROSSED VOLUNTARILY INTO ZACCHAEUS' HOUSE. A MAN OF GREAT RICHES, BUT HE WAS A LONELY MAN. HE WAS A HATED MAN. HE WAS AVOIDED BY ALMOST EVERYBODY IN TOWN. BUT HIS CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM. HE WANTED TO SEE JESUS. HE'D POSSIBLY HEARD ABOUT JESUS. AND HE'D HEARD THEM CALL HIM MANY NAMES. SOME PEOPLE HAD CALLED JESUS A DEVIL. SOME SAID HE WAS A FANATIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A BLASPHEMER. SOME SAID HE WAS A HERETIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A PROPHET. SOME SAID HE WAS AN IMPOSTER. AND MANY SAID THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE SON OF GOD. SO NATURALLY, ZACCHAEUS HAD A TREMENDOUS CURIOSITY TO SEE JESUS. BUT YOU SEE, TO SEE JESUS HE HAD SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY TO GET TO JESUS. THERE WAS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, A BIG CROWD. AND HE WAS A LITTLE FELLA. AND TO TRY TO PUSH HIS WAY THROUGH THAT CROWD WAS VERY DIFFICULT. AND HE WAS ALSO SMALL OF STATURE. HE WAS A VERY SMALL MAN. AND TO GET THROUGH THE CROWD WAS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS. AND MANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE JESUS IN YOUR HEART, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE SALVATION, BUT YOU FACE MANY OBSTACLES. WHAT ARE THEY? LET'S JUST LIST A FEW OF THEM THAT YOU FACE. FIRST IS PRIDE. THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT PRIDE KEEPS MORE PEOPLE FROM CHRIST THAN ANY OTHER SIN. THE SIN OF PRIDE. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD ""BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE."" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""IF ANY MAN AMONG YOU SEEMETH TO BE WISE IN THIS WORLD ""LET HIM BECOME A FOOL THAT HE MAY BE WISE."" JESUS SAID WE ARE TO BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN TO BE CONVERTED. AND IF YOU'RE TO GET CLOSE TO CHRIST AND HAVE CHRIST IN YOUR HEART YOU MAY BE WISE, BUT YOU MUST BECOME A FOOL. YOU MUST BECOME AS A CHILD. YOU SEE WE'RE ALL PROUD. AND WE DON'T LIKE TO HUMBLE OURSELVES. AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST IS IDOLATRY. AND IDOLATRY IS ANOTHER SIN AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS MENTIONED IS KEEPING MORE PEOPLE FROM GOD THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER SIN. AND OUR IDOLATRY IS VERY UNIQUE IN OUR DAY BECAUSE WE WORSHIP OURSELVES. WE WORSHIP MAN. WHETHER WE REALIZE IT OR NOT, WE'RE WORSHIPING OURSELVES, THE THINGS THAT WE'VE CREATED, THE THINGS WE'VE MADE WITH OUR HANDS. WHETHER IT'S A TELEVISION SET OR A NEW AUTOMOBILE, MATERIALISM. ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BECOME GODS AND GODDESSES. SEX HAS BECOME A GODDESS JUST AS MUCH AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF EPHESUS OR IN THE DAYS OF ROME. THESE ARE THE MODERN GODS. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IDOLATRY, THOSE THAT COMMIT IT, ""SHALL HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE ""WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE: ""WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH,"" IN REVELATION  21:8. GOD HATES IDOLATRY. AND THEN THE THIRD THING WHICH MAY KEEP SOME OF YOU FROM CHRIST IS WORLDLINESS. ""FOR WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED IF HE SHALL GAIN ""THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL? ""OR WHAT SHALL A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL?"" SAID JESUS IN MATTHEW 16. THERE ARE MANY OF YOU THAT ARE SELLING YOUR SOUL, YOUR ETERNAL SPIRIT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THIS WORLD. BUT JESUS SAID, SUPPOSE YOU GOT ALL THE OIL OF THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL THE GOLD IN SOUTH AFRICA, ALL THE DIAMONDS IN HOLLAND, ALL THE WEALTH OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND YOU HAD IT ALL, ALL THE MUSIC, ALL THE CULTURE, ALL THE PHILOSOPHY, ALL THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE WORLD, YOU HAD IT ALL AND LOST YOUR SOUL? IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT. AND YET, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR SOUL FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IT. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT TO HAVE MONEY. NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE DOES GOD CONDEMN A WEALTHY MAN UNLESS HE MISUSES IT OR UNLESS HE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY. THEN HE'S CONDEMNED. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, ""KNOW YE NOT ""THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE WORLD IS ENMITY WITH GOD? ""WHOSOEVER THEREFORE WILL BE A FRIEND OF THE WORLD ""IS THE ENEMY OF GOD."" NOW WHAT DOES THAT WORD ""WORLD"" MEAN? IT'S COSMOS , IT MEANS A WORLD SYSTEM DOMINATED BY EVIL. THAT EVIL PART OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEM IN WHICH WE LIVE. FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT MEANS ENMITY WITH GOD. AND GOD SAYS, ""COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND BE YE SEPARATE ""SAITH THE LORD AND TOUCH NOT THE UNCLEAN THING."" WORLDLINESS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MEANT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT PEOPLE HAD WITH THEIR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. NOW PERHAPS YOU SAW THOSE HUGE PICTURES ON TELEVISION A FEW MONTHS AGO OF SOME FORTY WHALES, WHO FOR SOME UNKNOWN BIOLOGICAL REASON BEACHED THEMSELVES AND DIED. THEY LEFT THEIR LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR ONE OF DEATH AND DIED. AND MANY OF YOU HAVE LEFT THE ENVIRONMENT OF LIVING IN THE SCRIPTURES AND LIVING FOR GOD, AND GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD AND YOUR SOUL IS DEAD TOWARD GOD. IT'S LIKE THE LEMMING IN SCANDINAVIA. THEY BAND TOGETHER. AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WALK DOWN INTO THE OCEAN AND DIE. YOU DELIBERATELY BRING ON YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL DEATH. YOU PROMOTE YOUR OWN ETERNAL DEATH BY GOING WITH THE EVILS OF THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU. AND THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU SQUEEZES YOU INTO ITS MOLD AND IT BECOMES A HINDRANCE TO YOU COMING TO JESUS CHRIST. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE WRONG THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WORLD; THE LUST AND THE GREED AND THE HATE AND THE PREJUDICE AND THE MATERIALISM PART OF THE WORLD THAT'S WRONG, YOU HAVE TO TURN FROM WHEN YOU COME TO CHRIST. AND THAT'S THE REASON IT'S SO HARD TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE MODERN DAY. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I'M NOT GOING TO FOOL YOU. I WOULD THINK IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO BE A CHRISTIAN RIGHT NOW IN MODERN AMERICA OR MODERN WESTERN WORLD THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD. YOU SEE TO BE A CHRISTIAN IN SOME PARTS OF THE ORIENT OR SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO REALLY STAND FOR CHRIST AND YOU HAVE TO SUFFER. BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S NO SUFFERING AND NO PHYSICAL PERSECUTION IT'S RATHER EASY JUST TO SLIDE ALONG, REALLY NOT KNOWING CHRIST. CALLING YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN BUT NOT REALLY BEING A CHRISTIAN, NOT A NEW TESTAMENT CHRISTIAN. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT HAVE GONE TO CHURCH ALL THEIR LIVES AND BEEN BAPTIZED AND CONFIRMED BUT STILL NOT KNOWING CHRIST. AND THEN ANOTHER OBSTACLE ARE SECRET SINS THE BIBLE SAYS. THE PSALMIST PRAYED, ""CLEANSE THOU ME FROM SECRET THOUGHTS."" AND PAUL WROTE TO THE ROMANS, ""THE DAY WHEN GOD SHALL JUDGE THE SECRETS OF MEN ""BY JESUS CHRIST."" YOU CAN KEEP NO SECRETS FROM GOD. YOUR FRIENDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW. AND GOD HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THEM. IT'S LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK ON TELEVISION. I THINK I'VE SEEN IT ONCE, MAYBE TWICE. BUT I READ ABOUT IT. AND IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY, IT'S TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PERSON INSIDE OF HIM, ALWAYS. AND PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN BATTLING WITH THE HIDDEN MAN IN YOUR HEART WITH YOUR SECRET SINS. CONFESS THEM TO CHRIST TONIGHT. COME TO THE CROSS AND BRING THOSE SECRETS OF YOUR HEART AND LAY THEM BEFORE HIM AND SAY, ""LORD, HERE THEY ARE. ""I SURRENDER."" AND THEN SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ANOTHER THING THAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM CHRIST. ""THERE IS A GENERATION,"" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THAT ARE PURE IN THEIR OWN EYES ""AND YET THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WASHED FROM THEIR FILTHINESS."" PURE IN OUR OWN EYES. PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE BAD. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE SINNING AND BREAKING GOD'S LAWS. THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST, SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOW WE'VE SEEN THE OBSTACLES, LET'S LOOK AT JESUS. IT'S A PERSONAL CALL. JESUS TURNS TO ZACCHAEUS AND CALLS HIM BY NAME. HE SEES ZACCHAEUS UP THE TREE. YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS HAD CLIMBED A SYCAMORE TREE AND WAS OUT ON THE LIMB, SITTING THERE WATCHING JESUS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST HATED MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST SINFUL MAN IN TOWN HEARS HIS NAME CALLED BY THE GREAT PROPHET, JESUS. AND JESUS SAYS, ""ZACCHAEUS."" CAN YOU IMAGE HOW STARTLED HE WAS THAT OUT OF ALL THAT CROWD AND THOSE RELIGIOUS LEADERS, HE, THE WORST SINNER IN TOWN, CALLED BY HIS NAME? THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS IS THE GOOD SHEPHERD. HE CALLETH HIS OWN SHEEP BY NAME AND LEADETH THEM. IN GENESIS WE READ THAT GOD CAME IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN PERSONALLY TO CALL ADAM. HE SAID, ""ADAM, ADAM, WHERE ART THOU?"" AND LATER HE CALLED ABRAHAM. HE SAID, ""ABRAHAM, JACOB, MOSES, JOSHUA, GIDEON, SAMUEL, ""DAVID, SOLOMON."" HE CALLED THEM ALL BY NAME. ""ISAIAH, JEREMIAH, EZEKIEL, DANIEL."" HE CALLED THEM BY NAME. AND THEN WHEN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST CAME HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES BY NAME. HE WENT DOWN BY THE SEASHORE AND HE CALLED OUT, ""SIMON PETER, ""ANDREW, JAMES, JOHN."" AND FROM THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM ANOTHER MAN, LIKE ZACCHAEUS, A TAX GATHERER, ""MATTHEW, COME AND FOLLOW ME."" AND HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED JESUS IMMEDIATELY. AND ON THE DAMASCUS ROAD, HE SAID, ""SAUL, SAUL, SAUL, WHY DO YOU PERSECUTE ME?"" AND ON THE ISLE OF PATMOS, HE SAID, ""JOHN."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. WHAT IS YOUR NAME; JIM, MARY, SUSIE, PETER? HE CALLED YOU BY NAME TONIGHT. HE KNOWS YOUR NAME. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MARY, GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT ""AND COME AND RECEIVE ME TONIGHT. ""I WANT TO COME INTO YOUR HOUSE AND INTO YOUR HEART."" ""JIM, YOU NEED ME. ""YOU KNOW YOU NEED ME TO HELP YOU, TO FORGIVE YOU, ""TO TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN. ""GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. HE LOOKED UP IN THE TREE AND SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS."" AND IT WAS AN URGENT CALL. HE SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS, MAKE HASTE, HURRY. ""WE DON'T HAVE LONG."" AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS TO YOU. HURRY, MAKE HASTE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO CHRIST, COME NOW. YOU MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT LIKE THIS. NOWHERE DOES THE BIBLE PROMISE TOMORROW YOU CAN BE SAVED. IT'S TODAY; TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. NOW IS THE ACCEPTED TIME. THERE MAY NOT BE A TOMORROW FOR YOU. THERE'S A LITTLE VERSE IN YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT SOMETIMES I MISS WHEN I HEAR IT SUNG. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. ""OH LORD OUR GOD, ARISE ON THEE OUR HOPES WE FIX. ""GOD SAVE US ALL."" TONIGHT THAT WOULD BE MY PRAYER FOR YOU. GOD SAVE US ALL. AND THAT'S WHAT THE LORD JESUS CAME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH IS LOST."" TODAY HE'S URGENTLY CALLING YOU BY NAME. AND IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL CALL BECAUSE ZACCHAEUS DID MAKE HASTE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE DIDN'T WAIT TO CLIMB DOWN THE TREE. HE JUMPED. AND D.L. MOODY, THE EVANGELIST OF THE LAST CENTURY, SAID THAT ZACCHAEUS WAS CONVERTED FROM THE LIMB TO THE GROUND. AND I EXPECT THAT'S ABOUT TRUE. THE RICH YOUNG RULER CAME TO JESUS. HE FELL DOWN BEFORE JESUS. HE WAS RUNNING TO JESUS. MAKING HASTE TO GET TO JESUS. AND HE GOT TO JESUS, BUT HE COULDN'T PAY THE PRICE. AND HE WAS LOST EVEN THOUGH JESUS LOVED HIM AND JESUS TRIED AND JESUS TALKED WITH HIM AND GAVE HIM PRECIOUS TIME. YET THAT YOUNG MAN NEVER CAME TO JESUS. BUT ZACCHAEUS, THE GREAT SINNER, DID COME TO JESUS. AND JESUS WENT TO ZACCHAEUS' HOME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK JESUS PROBABLY TOOK MATTHEW WITH HIM. AND I EXPECT THAT MATTHEW AND ZACCHAEUS GOT INTO A CONVERSATION LATE INTO THE NIGHT. AND MATTHEW TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. HOW HE HAD BEEN ALSO A TAX GATHERER AND HOW HE HAD BEEN A SINNER AND HOW JESUS HAD CALLED HIM BY NAME. AND HE SAID, ""FOLLOW ME."" AND MATTHEW SAID, ""I GOT UP RIGHT THEN AND FOLLOWED HIM ""AND I'VE NEVER REGRETTED ONE MINUTE OF IT. ""HE CHANGED MY LIFE, HE'S GIVEN ME ASSURANCE. ""HE'S BLESSED MY FAMILY. ""HE'S BROUGHT OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. ""OH, I'D DIE FOR HIM. ""I'VE GIVEN HIM MY LIFE."" AND ZACCHAEUS HEARD THAT. AND I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM THAT NIGHT, ""YOU KNOW ZACCHAEUS, ""IF YOU COME TO CHRIST, IF YOU COME TO JESUS, ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME RESTITUTION. ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE WAY OF LIVING. ""AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECLARE OPENLY ""YOUR ALLEGIANCE FOR JESUS CHRIST."" WE'RE TO BE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT OF IT. WE LIVE IN TWO WORLDS. WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD, BUT WE'RE ALSO CITIZENS OF ANOTHER WORLD, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. AND OUR FIRST ALLEGIANCE IS ALWAYS TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. YES, I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WHAT WAS THE RESULT? THE RESULT WAS THAT ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST. NOW RECEIVING CHRIST INVOLVES AN ACT OF FAITH BEYOND MERE HUMAN REASON. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVETH NOT ""THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD ""FOR THEY'RE FOOLISHNESS UNTO HIM. ""NEITHER CAN HE KNOW THEM BECAUSE ""THEY'RE SPIRITUALLY DISCERNED."" IN OTHER WORDS, A NATURAL PERSON LIKE YOU JUST CANNOT COME AND REASON HIS WAY TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. YOU CANNOT REASON YOUR WAY TO CHRIST. I DON'T IMAGINE ZACCHAEUS SAT DOWN AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE PHILOSOPHY AND ALL THE THEOLOGICAL DEBATES ABOUT JESUS. HE JUST JOYFULLY RECEIVED HIM BY FAITH. SIMPLY LIKE A LITTLE CHILD. AND JESUS RECEIVED HIM AND FORGAVE HIM. YOU SEE CHRIST IS KNOCKING ON OUR HEART'S DOOR TONIGHT. HE'S ASKING PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO RECEIVE HIM. AND THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SAYING, THEY ACCUSED HIM BY SAYING, ""THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS."" ARE YOU A SINNER? HAVE YOU BROKEN GOD'S LAW? I'M A SINNER. ARE YOU? SURE YOU ARE. HE RECEIVETH SINNERS. ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL THING THAT HE RECEIVETH SINNERS? AND WHEN I STAND, AND IF THEY SHOULD ASK ME AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN WHEN I DIE, ""WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?"" I'M GOING TO SAY, ""I'M HERE BY THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD ""BECAUSE OF WHAT JESUS CHRIST DID ON THE CROSS. ""I'M NOT HERE BY ANY GOOD WORKS BILLY GRAHAM EVER DID."" I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PREACHED IN A BIG STADIUM FULL OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS TONIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE READ THE BIBLE. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PRAYED. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN WIFE AND FIVE CHRISTIAN CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD. I'M A SINNER. I DESERVE JUDGMENT, I DESERVE HELL. I'M GOING BECAUSE OF CHRIST. AND I HAVE RECEIVED CHRIST. I'VE LET HIM COME INTO MY HEART. AND I'VE COME TO THE CROSS. HE'S FORGIVEN MY SIN. I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. I KNOW I'M SAVED TONIGHT. I KNOW WHERE I'VE COME FROM. I KNOW WHY I'M HERE. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. AND IF HE SHOULD COME TONIGHT, I'M READY. DO YOU KNOW THAT? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS. ""BUT AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, ""TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME SONS OF GOD ""EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ON HIS NAME."" YOU RECEIVE HIM AND LET HIM COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND YOU'LL FIND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE JOYFUL. WITHOUT CHRIST TO FILL THAT EMPTY VOID IN YOUR LIFE NOTHING ELSE SATISFIES. SEX DOESN'T DO IT. DRUGS DOESN'T DO IT. POWER, POPULARITY, ALL OF THAT IS NOTHING. CHRIST IS EVERYTHING. AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE CHRIST YOU'RE READY TO LIVE HERE AND NOW. LIFE WITH A CAPITAL L WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR SAVIOR. YES, ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST JOYFULLY. AND NOTICE ANOTHER THING, ZACCHAEUS OPENLY CONFESSED CHRIST, PUBLICLY. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF ALL OF HIS FRIENDS IN THE WHOLE TOWN AND HE SAID, ""I'VE BEEN WRONG, I'VE BEEN A SINNER. ""I'M READY TO RESTORE EVERYTHING I EVER DID IF NECESSARY. ""WHATEVER IT TAKES. ""FROM NOW ON I'M FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST. ""HE IS MY LORD AND HE IS MY SAVIOR. ""HE CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE ME IN THIS TOWN OF JERICHO."" HE CAME TO HALIFAX IN THE FORM OF THIS CRUSADE TO SEEK AND TO SAVE YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME WHILE THERE'S TIME."" BECAUSE YOU SEE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER DENIETH THE SON, THE SAME HATH NOT THE FATHER. ""HE THAT CONFESSED THE SON OPENLY ""HATH THE FATHER ALSO."" ALSO THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER SHALL CONFESS THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD ""DWELLETH IN HIM AND HE IN GOD."" AND JESUS SAID, ""IF YOU DENY ME BEFORE MEN."" IF YOU DENY ME PUBLICLY; ""I'LL NOT CONFESS YOU ""BEFORE MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN."" YOU SEE JESUS CHRIST HUNG ON THE CROSS PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, DYING, BLEEDING FOR YOU. AND HE ASKS YOU TO PUBLICLY RECEIVE HIM. AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO THAT IN A MOMENT. THERE'RE THREE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO. FIRST, LISTEN TO THIS SO YOU CAN NEVER STAND AT THE JUDGMENT AND SAY, ""I NEVER KNEW."" FIRST, YOU MUST REPENT OF YOUR SIN. HOW DO YOU REPENT? THE WORD REPENT MEANS TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. IT MEANS TO TURN. YOU'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION IN YOUR LIFE, YOU TURN AROUND AND START IN A NEW DIRECTION. NOW, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TURN BY YOURSELF. IF FACT YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO SAY, ""LORD, HELP ME TO TURN, ""HELP ME TO REPENT."" IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LET CHRIST COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR WHOLE PATTERN OF LIVING, YOUR LIFESTYLE, EVERYTHING, IF NECESSARY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING, BY FAITH YOU RECEIVE HIM. NOW THAT WORD FAITH MAY CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE. IT MEANS THAT YOU COMMIT, THAT YOU SURRENDER YOUR TOTAL LIFE  TO JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER GOD, YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER RELIGION. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANYTHING BUT JESUS CHRIST AND HIM ALONE TO SAVE YOU. THAT'S FAITH, TOTAL COMMITMENT TO CHRIST. AND THEN THIRDLY, YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW HIM. YOU'RE WILLING TO BE HIS DISCIPLE. NOW THE WORD DISCIPLE MEANS LEARNER OR DISCIPLINE. IT MEANS DISCIPLINED LEARNING. YOU'RE FOLLOWING HIM. GROWING IN THE GRACE AND KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BY STUDYING THE BIBLE, BY PRAYER, BY WITNESSING, BY ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH. YOU SAY, ""WELL, BILLY, YOU KNOW MOST OF THOSE THINGS ""I'M ALREADY DOING."" BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST? ARE YOU SURE OF IT? IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, IF YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN THAT CHRIST IS IN YOUR HEART TONIGHT AND THAT YOUR SIN IS FORGIVEN, HE'S CALLING YOU BY NAME. HE SEES YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE AND COME."" I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT RIGHT NOW, HUNDREDS OF YOU FROM EVERYWHERE AS WE'VE SEEN EVERY NIGHT. GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME AND STAND IN FRONT. AND SAY BY COMING, ""I WANT TO COME TO THE CROSS ""BY FAITH TONIGHT AND I WANT MY SINS FORGIVEN. ""I WANT TO KNOW THAT I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. ""I WANT TO KNOW I'M GOING TO HEAVEN."" YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW, QUICKLY AND STAND HERE. IF YOU'RE WITH FRIENDS OR RELATIVES THEY'LL WAIT. AND AFTER YOU COME, I'M GOING TO SAY A WORD TO YOU AND HAVE A PRAYER WITH YOU. AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME LITERATURE TO HELP YOU IN YOUR CHRISTIAN LIFE. AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND JOIN YOUR FRIENDS. BUT I'M GOING TO ASK NO ONE TO LEAVE THE STADIUM NOW AT THIS HOLY MOMENT. EVERYONE IN AN ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY COMING. YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW TOO. GOD IS CALLING YOU BY NAME. JESUS IS LOOKING IN YOUR DIRECTION. AND HE KNOWS YOUR HEART AND HE SAYS, ""COME."" YOU GET UP AND COME QUICKLY.

NTQUJxUbpiM,"so you're driving down the street and you get hit with this fear thing about the doctor's report or about some issue at work but instead of yielding to the fear you take the stuff that's been thrown at you you use it as fuel and you begin to sing the new song that actually brings about the new day because in that new song God himself comes and he destroys the powers that have been set against you for your destruction [Applause] thanks thank you thanks thanks thanks love you thanks well I love you too we just still got to do that group hug one of these days an old guy was working out at the gym an old guy was working out at the gym when he spotted a young lady who walked in and he asked his trainer standing next to him what machine should I use to impress that girl over there the trainer looked at him up and down and said I'd recommend the ATM machine in the [Applause] lobby that's funny that's funny somebody talked this week about it's in Mark chapter 6 where Jesus had his disciples and he wanted to take them to a deserted place and if I were to water my yard and there was water all over the place you would come look at it and say it's been watered because I put water on it so what is a deserted place it has desserts do you not see that in the word I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the scripture says it's a deserted Place amen I'm sticking with it that's my interpretation right there open your Bibles to Isaiah that's that's the that's the revised passion translation right there the Rev I'll have to tell Brian tonight when he comes open your Bibles to uh Psalms excuse me to Isaiah 42 I was blessed uh this morning with the passage that Eric opened the meeting up with and and while it's not verbatim in this lesson it does help to set the stage uh Eric read this morning out of Psalms 24 where there's the question who is this king of glory and the the statement that's made is lift up your heads oh you Gates and the king of glory will come in lift up your heads oh you Gates it's it's a strange metaphor because you know we don't see heads on top of gates and yet there's this uh there's this unusual picture and it's actually you can't always use uh the same uh wording or the same subject throughout scripture it doesn't all sometimes you actually bend the the real intention of scripture but I think I I really think this is a consistent theme throughout scripture so I'm going to play off it for a moment says lift up your heads or you gates in Isaiah 60 Gates were praise in Revelation the gates were made out of pearls pearls are formed through irritation the gates of praise are formed in our life when we go against circumstances and glorify Jesus anyway something is shaped in us so here's this unusual picture it says lift up your heads the lifting of the head has everything in the world to do with our countenance the Bible says he's the glory and the lifter of our head lifting of the head is not um to give us some kind of a psychological Edge lifting of the head ch changes what we see Jesus wanted his disciples to see the Harvest fields and so he told them lift up your eyes and see the fields are wi under Harvest lift up look up before you look down and you'll see things differently there's something about changing the countenance lifting our heads lifting our our our it's a it's a look of anticipation where we set our eyes on the Lord and there's something about setting the eyes of our heart on Heavenly things in attitude in countenance in conduct so here's this unusual passage lift up your heads oh you Gates and the king of glory will come in the word gate this subject of gate I should say in the Psalms God says the gates of Zion are his eternal Dwelling Place he lives in a gate that makes no sense unless you see gate as praise and he inhabits the Praises of his people do you see the connections here so this invitation is like this lift up your countenance before you get the answer you need on you're not lifting your countenance because you got the Breakthrough you're lifting your countenance and you're giving him thanks and praise in spite of circumstances you're willing to let the the gate be formed in you that says I will praise Him continuously regardless of circumstances and so we lift up the countenance as a lifestyle of anticipation of Grace and in that place we give him praise and what does it say that is the gate that he comes through anyone can lift the head after the king of glory has come now I understand he's the merciful one he is the one who comes in he wipes away our tears he comes in brings Comfort he brings healing to the broken that's the merciful god that comes to serve but in this passage he comes as the king of glory and when he shows up as the king of glory he comes as the triumphant one he doesn't come to minister to the broken toenail he doesn't come to fix the disappointment he comes because Victory is established and is at hand and so when we see this lift up your heads are your Gates he's the glory he's the lifter of my head in that context regardless of circumstances I will give him praise in fact I will use the circumstances to fuel my praise and what happens that becomes the very gate that he comes through as the king of glory now Isaiah uh 42 is uh personally a really really uh favorite passage I've taught on it many times I think it's been a long long time though um and uh and so I it it uh was just in my heart this week and so I wanted to share with with you so Isaiah 42 we'll start with verse 10 and we're going to read through verse 13 sing to the Lord a new song and his praise from the ends of the Earth you who go down to the Sea all that is in it you Coast lands you inhabitants of them let the Wilderness and its City lift up their voices or their voice The Villages that Kadar inhabits let the inhabitants of Sila sing Let Them shout from the top of the mountains let them give glory to the Lord and his praise to the coastlands now here's God's response the Lord will go forth like a mighty man he will stir up his Zeal like a man of war he shall cry out yes alow shout aloud he shall Prevail against his enemies I think it's probably obvious why I love this portion so much and maybe many of you have it underlined already in your Bible is here's this um there's this incredible moment in time where the people of God are exhorted to sing loudly to the Lord and the result is God himself stir himself up as a man of war to go forth and to do exploits on our behalf how many you know God and the devil are not at war with each other uh the devil doesn't stand a chance uh that's that's not a war that's not a contest I mean the Lord all he has to do is Blink and poof you know the devil's chrisy crator there's no there's no contest there's there's no contest there whatsoever it's not as though that God is perfect good and the devil is perfect evil and there's this ying and yang War that's not true God is God period the devil and powers of Darkness were defeated through a man Jesus the son of God who became a man and defeated him on our our behalf because we missed our chance y that is the truth but so Jesus came the son of man and uh and and brought a a a end to the power of death disease torment Etc the powers of Darkness back to the subject here's this great passage of scripture that says Sing a new song to the Lord and then he responds in a military fashion and brings about Victory on our behalf I've always I've always been fascinated with this thought that you and I could sit here in the middle of this room and just enjoy the peace of God and just enjoy his presence and not a care in the world whatever I brought in is no longer with me you know the issues the baggage whatever I'm just here in his presence and I just love him so much and I give him praise and I give him thanks and all the while I'm just enjoying his presence while he's just knocking a snot out of the powers of darkness and when it's all over he comes back and he calls me me a mighty man of war I go when when was I in war oh that praise thing you did this is I I I translated it for you and I just I just kicked you know the devil around for a while on your behalf you know it's it's I love that picture it may not do anything for you but it does a lot for me Warfare I is I it makes me nervous that Warfare could easily become the reason for people's praise it cannot be that way it's just a wonderful side benefit it's not the reason we give God honor the reason we give God honor is his worth that is the reason it is the entire basis of Praise is who he is here's this phrase to sing to the Lord a new song I love uh I I I love the new songs I love the songs that our teams write for us and the songs we learned around the world but when it says a new song it's not talking about sit down write a nice song and then we'll sing it it's it's more referring to a spontaneous response to the Lord in the book of Ephesians there is a verse that uh where Paul talks about um singing making melody in your heart to the Lord and he and he and he uses this phrase Psalms hymns and spiritual songs Psalms are are are scripture songs hymns are the songs we write they don't have to be 100 years old to qualify as a hymn there are songs that we write they can be written today you know John and Charles Wesley the Great uh um Methodist leaders uh John was the great preacher Charles was the hymnwriter and the whole basis for the writing hym was hymns or hers writing hymns sorry that's that's bad Apostles and their wives Epistles yeah yeah never mind um the whole reason for their writing hymns was to teach theology so that the people would sing truth they would become that I I met with some of our worship team years years ago and I I I remember telling them I asked them the question I said what do you want the church to look like in 10 years write songs about it now and we'll sing our way into it there something something happens when we capture the heart of God the theme of God in a song so when it talks about Psalms that's out of the scripture hymns that's something we write spiritual songs are the spontaneous we don't sing them to be recorded we don't sing them so that we can sing them to Mom send them to mop and show us how good we can do you know it's not it's not a song that's for anyone else it's for the audience of one it's that which is honest it's raw it doesn't have to rhyme it doesn't have to don't even have to carry a tune it's beautiful God likes the way you sing your neighbor may not but God likes the way you sing and that's all that matters it's for the audience of one and so that Spontaneous Song is an important part of our life as Believers and um he here's this uh the Spontaneous Song is either a praise song to him it can include intercessory uh prayer as well as you'll see in scripture but it's a spontaneous song of praise to him or it's what we refer to in scripture as the song of the Lord that's where the Lord himself is singing over people and that would take on more of a prophetic type song where uh a message is given to a group of people the reason I mention this uh as a spontaneous song is that all of us probably all of us most of us anyway have a great desire to increase in our sensitivity to the Holy Spirit to be ready to do whatever he's doing I want to just sense the heart of God in a matter I want to move easily with him I don't you know I don't want him to have to hit me over the head with a 2x4 to get my attention so he can then direct me you know as I I don't want he I don't want to portray him that way but you get my my point is there's some days at the end end of the day I look back and I go man I was so caught up on my agenda today that I missed all these opportunities that you opened up for me and I didn't even see them and I don't like that and so I I want that that that continuous sensitivity to the voice of God to the presence of God so that he he can just breathe slightly and I catch what he's saying what he's doing how do you stay in tune to that kind of Lifestyle I think there's two things you can do proactively to build that sense of awareness the first one is to pray in tongues pray a lot Paul said he prayed more than all and uh and the word he used there is I pray more than than all of you combined in other words he was saying listen if you knew what I was going through you'd understand why I pray in tongues all the time and and really that was the whole case is that spiritual language it's that it's learning to stay connected to the holy spirit it's not it's not something taking over our body it's a it's the willful use of a prayer language that God gives us if you don't have just ask him because he's really generous with this gift it goes to every anyone who wants it just sweat to get it it comes much easier so this gift this praying in the spirit is a huge part of our life it's supposed to be a huge part of our life because it's the one gift given that is for us all the other gifts are enabling us to serve well the people around us but praying in the spirit is something that edifies and strengthens us what does it do it connects me to the spontaneous because it bypasses my understanding I don't know what I'm praying after a while you start to you start to pick up you start praying in the spirit but you start picking up the kinds of areas that God is moving your heart in you start Discerning things but what's happening is the Lord is he's training us how to live in the spontaneous not so that we avoid Reason Not So that we avoid uh uh understanding or intellectual approach to things I think that's vital I think we're supposed to have understanding of things but it doesn't do me a whole lot of good to have great understanding and not hear his voice not be able to be moved with with the presence in the spirit of God so that's one the second one is this Spontaneous Song is say you drive down the street and you just spontaneously sing out of whatever season you're in whatever moment you're in maybe it's a crisis that you have going on maybe there's this maybe you've received a doctor's report that's really a bad report you don't sing the report you sing the answer to the report you you sing the solution you sing you sing the praises to God in the middle of it you know years ago uh dick Mills was such a dear friend of s and I remember uh he he told us this story once he said he was just really being harassed by the devil it's just really one of those you know one of those extreme seasons in his life and extreme moments so he went into a room he got two chairs he had the chairs face each other and Dick sat in one and he said Satan sit down I'm going to praise God and you're going to watch I love that I love that that whole thing that listen in the middle of of whatever is going on I have determined to take what what the enemy has meant for evil and I'm going to use that as the fuel to exalt him in his greatness because there's not one problem that I am facing in Life or could ever face that he has not already purchased the answer for I don't come to God begging for breakthrough as though he needed to do something he already took care of something all I'm doing is aligning my heart to receive what he's already purchased and put in my account and so this whole idea of singing a new song is huge I love this portion of scripture but it's possible for us to miss the context so I want you to go to verse n of Isaiah 42 verse 9 says behold the former things have come to pass the new things I declare before they spring forth I tell you of them look at that verse again behold the former things have come to pass the new things I declare before they spring forth I tell you of them why is that important well first of all if you look at the previous chapter it's just Israel's in a mess again and they just got this they got this they got this bad habit of worshiping God one day and worshiping you know some false god another day and so they got this they got this Spirit of dumb all over them and they're doing the confused thing and there's this cry I think it's in there if I remember right I was glancing over to this morning uh if I remember right there's I think it's twice in chapter 41 they are basically asking the Lord to please do a new thing please do do something new please we're ready do something new anybody ready for God to do something new we're ready for you to do something new so here the Lord in the first part of Isaiah 42 he sends the Messiah the answer with breakthrough if you read through the chapter you see he's opening blind eyes he comes in the spirit of God so here Jesus comes with this mantle of breakthrough and now the Lord stands before the people says all right the old things are over new things begin his very next phrase sing to the Lord a new song yeah that's good the new song brings the new day come on it's not hard to write an inspirational piece after you won the lottery after you you won the Super Bowl after some great dream of yours F was fulfilled you finally found the man or the woman of your dreams or whatever it might be you finally were able to have a child and you couldn't those are wonderful write those songs they need to be sung sing them sit in your living room and sing those songs but this one's different this is Israel coming through hell asking for a new day and Jesus says all right the past is over new things began he says all right sing a new song it's interesting in Psalms 40 you guys doing all right here all right Psalm I think it's Psalms 40 he says sing to the Lord a new song in the very next phrase says and the Earth will fear the Lord that's a that's a strange Connection in subjects you know sing to the Lord a new song and there's going to be a whole bunch of people get saved it's not it's not like let's get a Stadium fill it with 100,000 people then we'll have Chris come up here and sing a new song and then we'll have a lot of people saved it it's not saying that it's not saying let's get the worship team up here to sing some brand new prophetic song lot of people's get getting saved he's not saying he's talking about lifesty St in the living room in your bathroom driving your car it's the song that nobody hears but what's happening did you see what happens in response to verse 10 the Lord arouses himself as a man of war so you're driving down the street and you get hit with this fear thing about the doctor's report or about some issue at work they're laying off people oh no what if I lose my job you start get having that stuff going on but instead of yielding to the fear you take the stuff that's been thrown at you you use it as fuel and it becomes the lyrics of a song and you begin to sing the new song that actually brings about the new day why does it bring about the new day because in that new song God himself stir himself up as a man of war and he comes and he destroys the powers that have been set against you for your destruction that's why things change how does that affect your neighbor how does that affect the city how does that affect the nation it's easy the Lord WS havoc on the powers of Darkness that have influence over the thought life and value system of a community so picture this here we are as the people of God spread all through the community just throughout the day continuously throughout the day just lifting up the new song the spontaneous song God we give you thanks we give you thanks that you are turning this into a city of great Prosperity we bless you for what you're doing God we thank you Lord that unemployment will be a thing of the past we praise you God as the god of abundance that you bring healing and cancer is being destroyed from our city and we you just take these things you just begin to sing them what happens the Lord starts wreaking havoc on those powers of the a that have influence of the thought life what happens the people around you start having clear thoughts for the first time in their life that's why people turn to the Lord because they can see this is obvious yeah this is obvious this one who gave himself for me is the only one with the right to rule my life [Applause] that's I uh had this little b with sickness here recently and I talked about it last Sunday night so if you have any interest in I I don't like replaying the story but uh but I think it's available online somewhere if you want to hear it but I I got I got to where I couldn't eat I mean I I I just I was sick sick sick and um I I was um I ended up having a surgical procedure and I'm doing really good my health is just returning I'm just you know I'm eating meat which is really the main thing the main testimony is that things have died to keep me alive and I'm okay with that I'm I'm all right with that totally over in fact more things are going to die so my strength is returning I'm this is my first Sunday uh back in the morning to actually speak so and I'm doing all three services so we see how I do that but I'm doing well but um the you know just in in being just sick and uh and doing so poorly it was a gift to be able to sit at home in my recliner and just to read and just review the promises of God to review the prophetic words over my life and it's a it's a regular part of my life but I had extra time for it and uh Benny and I would take communion most every day together and we would uh we would just take communion and just give thanks for divine health and and it wasn't forced it wasn't like no I don't want to but I'm going to just grit It Up by faith no it was there's something so rich in the presence of God that rests upon you the peace that passes understanding comes to us when we don't demand to understand and that that that comes upon on you there's such a Grace in it to do right things and good things and so we would share in communion and I would pray over one of the elements Benny would pray with the other and this just a regular a regular part of our of our our life and I I remember um I remember there there there came a point where I could no longer eat anything in fact I I went uh 10 days without even uh drinking water I couldn't drink anything I couldn't they just kept me plugged up to uh plugged into intervenous feeding which is you can live a while on that so that worked well for me so um and we I couldn't take communion but she would take it for me and uh she would come next to the bed and she would take and we would pray together and and what we gave thanks for the most was just just the Divine Health the life that God had given us the victory that he had given us you know you know you don't have to beg him for what he already bought and paid for and put in your account what you want to do is just just condition your heart to celebrate what's there and uh you know I I have more questions than I've ever had but as I've I've stated before I will never sacrifice what I know about the goodness of God on the altar of human reasoning so that I have an explanation for why something happened I I don't need an explanation I have a person who is with me and there's something about facing difficulty and not losing your peace that actually annoys the devil to Pieces there's something about even experiencing loss or having things that go on that just you just can't explain you don't have a slot for I don't need a slot for it I have a person that I get to walk with and there's something about becoming the people that just have said this is the way I'm doing in life in any and every situation I will give him thanks I will give him praise I will take the very weapons that the enemy uses against me and much like David took Goliath's sword and cut off Goliath's head so I will take the very things that the enemy has throwing my way and they will become the lyrics of my offering of praise to God God I give you I give you thanks for divine health I give you thanks for abundance and breakthrough we would just Delight to together in our family oh you know in those kinds of moments and there's many of you you've gone through things way worse than I've ever gone through I I get that but this was a a a pretty CH big challenging situation for me I remember you know you you don't you don't lay there not being able to eat or drink or function uh really you don't you don't lay there wishing you would have written another book you don't you don't lay there thinking oh if I only would have preached in one more City or if I would have gone of this nation all you think about is family friends that's it it's it's people it's the gift of being able to serve Jesus with friends with family it's looking at my kids my grandkids it's it's it's seeing it's just seeing the rich rich life in God it's just it's real tough real tough to get depressed when you see blessing everywhere you look you know it's just you know you can you can look at some things that are unsettled unanswered but but they don't fuel me they don't fuel me because I because I'm a I'm a I'm a singer of new songs and a singer of new songs just takes the information that comes and gives it as an offering and celebrates and declares his greatness I honestly have tried to live that for just on as long as I can remember but there are you know there are moments there things that happen to us that just are really tough and it kind of challenges you at a new level and so the Lord just kind of peels back the layer of that onion at another level you know and that's what happened for me this last couple months but but I'd like to I'd like to say that the cool thing about this verse is that all my job was was to give him praise and he's the one who fought the Battle it's the most beautiful thing because sometimes the Lord has you in a position where you rest sometimes he has you in a position where you fight I talked about this more clearly last Sunday night I I believe in this I believe the kingdom suffers violence the violent take a force I believe in that the prayer the fasting the yelling the shouting waging Flags chauffeur pouring out oil whatever you got any any Christian toy you have that you think will work let's use it and let's get that thing going and let's just apprehend what's wrong and get it turned around and I'm good I'm good with all of it you know get the trumpets blaring and I mean we've marched all over this property we've marched up and down that street we've waved the flags we've had the horns we've pulled oil I go to my back door to my office and there's oil dripping down the door somebody's been here just praying over I don't know that's it's I'm okay with it though I'm not offended it's just there it's just one of the things that we do use everything you have but there are times where there's not a thing you can use that will bring about a change the only thing you can do is sit down and give thanks let him do this one for you and this is one of those verses this is one of those moments where he says it's the Lord who becomes the warrior and all he did was respond to the brand new song of yielded heart that says I'm going to take this about him and put it in Praise why don't you stand the most amazing thing happened Jesus Jesus was perfect no sin no sin in thought attitude nothing and yet he he took upon himself the punishment that I deserve that you deserve because everybody here we all have sinned we all have fallen short of the glory of God and then the mercy of Jesus comes and Jesus had you in mind he had me in mind and he bore punishment in his own flesh so that we could actually receive what he deserved which is life forever and I know that anytime we have this many people in a room there's always a high chance high probability that we have people here that just you don't have a personal relationship with Jesus you may be tend church every week I don't know you you maybe it's the first time you you've been in a church I it matters not to me the the whole point is is I believe the stage has been set for you to know what it is to be forgiven of sin and to step into eternal life know what it is to have God as your father and to be changed from the inside you can't we can't make ourselves worthy I can't jump through enough Hoops to become clean before God it's an impossible task that's why Jesus died if there was another way to get right before God then he was cruel to require the death of his son if there was another way the only way Jesus died is because there was no other way there's no other way and that offer his offering to you and to me is present right here right now and I want to make sure that everybody in this place is able to leave today with the absolute confidence that number one I've been born again I've been forgiven of sin and God receives me into his family and I want to start life all over again brand new because Jesus has forgiven me and come into my life if that's you if you have never surrendered your life is a term we use where we we really give ourselves to the only one who has a right to rule our life that's Jesus you know the crazy thing is is he rules my life and there's more freedom being ruled by him than there ever was doing what I wanted that's that's it's like this stuff just doesn't make sense but it does and that's the point is I want to give opportunity for everybody here to leave with certainty that Jesus really is your father heavenly father he becomes the one who forgives you and receives you into the family that you have born again if that's if you're in that place and you say Bill I don't want to leave till I know that's a reality for me then I want you just put your hand up and I want to just see where you are I want to make agreement with you right over here I want to make that agreement with you that Jesus will come into your life yeah beautiful anybody else put your hand up real quick I'm just going to wait like a minute so I I'm I'm not going to prolong this but if there's if there's anybody else put you hand up Pro quick I think we had four four people in the first service this morning is wonderful people that come to Christ say I I don't want to leave till I know that I'm right with God anyone else just real quick okay all right we've got a freedom banner and i' uh if you would come down here I've got uh people that I know and trust that will uh pray love on you and pray for you and this is going to be the change of the rest of your life starts today yeah amen beautiful there's anybody else that wants to join come on down Freedom Banner people come on down all right you still owe me five minutes so don't get real ansy now all right I I that's the time right up there you owe me five that's the way I look at it so if you didn't know you owed me I'm letting you know I'm just telling you I want to pray over you because I I I believe there's a Grace for a new song I believe there's a Grace I believe there's I believe there's a Grace and I really want to emphasize this strongly I Eric shared this story bizarre story again this week of of a gal who quit singing as a child until she became a young adult never sang at all because of a comment made to her about her voice when she was a small child and you know it may be that we need that we want certain we do want certain quality on the CDs that we buy and the radios that we listen to and the worship team but that that you sing to the Lord is priceless to him in whatever form you bring it and I want to pray for an anointing literally an anointing on thought an anointing on our life to bring the new song you know why CU I want to see you in a new day it's the new song that brings the new day it's the new song that's given as a continual offering to the Lord that spontaneity that develops in our life for it to become enhanced and strengthened for every single person I I want to hear more and more stories about people were just unusually led to do something something not outside of their character and yet they just believed God and God provided that Miracle that's the lifestyle of a holy spirit-led believer it's not apart from reason it's just according to his reason yes amen all right put your hands in front of you and we'll uh let me just pray over you father I do pray for a Grace a gift to be given for the new song that even those who are not in any way musically inclined that there would be just a musical anointing a an anoint a Grace a presence to sing new songs to you that shape the history of our life and actually impact and affect the city around us bring almost like volcanically from within us prophetically new songs that create new days we ask this for the honor of the name Jesus amen amen"
7c_yxXjQMyI," FROM OUR ARCHIVES...  THE BILLY GRAHAM CLASSICS. [applause] NOW, TONIGHT I WANT YOU TO TURN WITH ME TO THE 19TH CHAPTER  OF LUKE'S GOSPEL, THE 19TH CHAPTER. JESUS IS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO AT THIS POINT  IN SCRIPTURE. AND A BLIND MAN SCREAMED OUT AND SAID, ""JESUS, THOU SON OF DAVID, HAVE MERCY UPON ME."" AND JESUS TOUCHED HIM AND HE WAS HEALED. AND NOW HE'S PASSING RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF JERICHO AND ANOTHER INCIDENT HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME. ""AND JESUS ENTERED AND PASSED THROUGH JERICHO. ""AND, BEHOLD, THERE WAS A MAN NAMED ZACCHAEUS, ""WHICH WAS THE CHIEF AMONG THE PUBLICANS, ""AND HE WAS VERY RICH. ""AND HE SOUGHT TO SEE JESUS WHO HE WAS; ""AND COULD NOT  FOR THE PRESS."" THAT MEANS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, THAT DOESN'T MEAN  THE MEDIA. ""BECAUSE HE WAS LITTLE OF STATURE. ""AND HE RAN BEFORE, AND CLIMBED UP INTO A SYCAMORE TREE ""TO SEE HIM: FOR HE WAS TO PASS THAT WAY. ""AND WHEN JESUS CAME TO THE PLACE, HE LOOKED UP, ""AND SAW HIM, AND SAID TO HIM, ZACCHAEUS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME DOWN; FOR TODAY ""I GOING TO ABIDE  AT YOUR HOUSE. ""AND HE MADE HASTE, AND HE CAME DOWN, ""AND HE RECEIVED HIM JOYFULLY. ""AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY ALL MURMURED, AND SAYING, ""THAT HE WAS GONE TO BE THE GUEST ""WITH A MAN WHO'S A SINNER. ""AND ZACCHAEUS STOOD, AND SAID UNTO THE LORD: ""BEHOLD, LORD, HALF OF ALL MY GOODS ""I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THE POOR; ""AND IF I HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING FROM ANY MAN ""BY FALSE ACCUSATION, I RESTORE FOURFOLD. ""AND JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, ""THIS DAY, THIS DAY ""IS SALVATION COME TO THIS HOUSE, ""FOR AS MUCH AS HE ALSO IS A SON OF ABRAHAM. ""FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST."" THE SON OF MAN IS COME TO SEEK AND SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT THAT ARE LOST. YOU'RE NOT LOST FROM YOUR PARENTS, SO MUCH, OR LOST FROM YOUR FRIENDS. YOU ARE LOST FROM GOD. YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM GOD. AND JESUS HAS COME TO SEEK YOU OUT. AND HE SOUGHT OUT ZACCHAEUS. AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY AS JESUS WAS PASSING THROUGH JERICHO. NOW YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS WAS A PUBLICAN. THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS A TAX GATHERER AND HE WORKED FOR ROME. HE WAS RICH. HE WAS DESPISED. HE WAS A SOCIAL OUTCAST. THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE TAX GATHERERS GATHERING TAXES FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT DOMINATED THEM. AND IF JESUS HAD CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION HE WOULD HAVE NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT ZACCHAEUS. BUT JESUS NEVER CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPINION. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT ""ON ALL OCCASIONS JESUS MADE OF HIMSELF ""NO REPUTATION."" AND I IMAGINE IT HAD BEEN MANY MONTHS SINCE ANYONE HAD EVER CROSSED VOLUNTARILY INTO ZACCHAEUS' HOUSE. A MAN OF GREAT RICHES, BUT HE WAS A LONELY MAN. HE WAS A HATED MAN. HE WAS AVOIDED BY ALMOST EVERYBODY IN TOWN. BUT HIS CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM. HE WANTED TO SEE JESUS. HE'D POSSIBLY HEARD ABOUT JESUS. AND HE'D HEARD THEM CALL HIM MANY NAMES. SOME PEOPLE HAD CALLED JESUS A DEVIL. SOME SAID HE WAS A FANATIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A BLASPHEMER. SOME SAID HE WAS A HERETIC. SOME SAID HE WAS A PROPHET. SOME SAID HE WAS AN IMPOSTER. AND MANY SAID THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE SON OF GOD. SO NATURALLY, ZACCHAEUS HAD A TREMENDOUS CURIOSITY TO SEE JESUS. BUT YOU SEE, TO SEE JESUS HE HAD SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY TO GET TO JESUS. THERE WAS THE PRESS OF THE CROWD, A BIG CROWD. AND HE WAS A LITTLE FELLA. AND TO TRY TO PUSH HIS WAY THROUGH THAT CROWD WAS VERY DIFFICULT. AND HE WAS ALSO SMALL OF STATURE. HE WAS A VERY SMALL MAN. AND TO GET THROUGH THE CROWD WAS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS. AND MANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO JESUS, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE JESUS IN YOUR HEART, AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE SALVATION, BUT YOU FACE MANY OBSTACLES. WHAT ARE THEY? LET'S JUST LIST A FEW OF THEM THAT YOU FACE. FIRST IS PRIDE. THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT PRIDE KEEPS MORE PEOPLE FROM CHRIST THAN ANY OTHER SIN. THE SIN OF PRIDE. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD ""BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE."" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""IF ANY MAN AMONG YOU SEEMETH TO BE WISE IN THIS WORLD ""LET HIM BECOME A FOOL THAT HE MAY BE WISE."" JESUS SAID WE ARE TO BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN TO BE CONVERTED. AND IF YOU'RE TO GET CLOSE TO CHRIST AND HAVE CHRIST IN YOUR HEART YOU MAY BE WISE, BUT YOU MUST BECOME A FOOL. YOU MUST BECOME AS A CHILD. YOU SEE WE'RE ALL PROUD. AND WE DON'T LIKE TO HUMBLE OURSELVES. AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST IS IDOLATRY. AND IDOLATRY IS ANOTHER SIN AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS MENTIONED IS KEEPING MORE PEOPLE FROM GOD THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER SIN. AND OUR IDOLATRY IS VERY UNIQUE IN OUR DAY BECAUSE WE WORSHIP OURSELVES. WE WORSHIP MAN. WHETHER WE REALIZE IT OR NOT, WE'RE WORSHIPING OURSELVES, THE THINGS THAT WE'VE CREATED, THE THINGS WE'VE MADE WITH OUR HANDS. WHETHER IT'S A TELEVISION SET OR A NEW AUTOMOBILE, MATERIALISM. ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BECOME GODS AND GODDESSES. SEX HAS BECOME A GODDESS JUST AS MUCH AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF EPHESUS OR IN THE DAYS OF ROME. THESE ARE THE MODERN GODS. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IDOLATRY, THOSE THAT COMMIT IT, ""SHALL HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE ""WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE: ""WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH,"" IN REVELATION  21:8. GOD HATES IDOLATRY. AND THEN THE THIRD THING WHICH MAY KEEP SOME OF YOU FROM CHRIST IS WORLDLINESS. ""FOR WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED IF HE SHALL GAIN ""THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL? ""OR WHAT SHALL A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL?"" SAID JESUS IN MATTHEW 16. THERE ARE MANY OF YOU THAT ARE SELLING YOUR SOUL, YOUR ETERNAL SPIRIT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THIS WORLD. BUT JESUS SAID, SUPPOSE YOU GOT ALL THE OIL OF THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL THE GOLD IN SOUTH AFRICA, ALL THE DIAMONDS IN HOLLAND, ALL THE WEALTH OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND YOU HAD IT ALL, ALL THE MUSIC, ALL THE CULTURE, ALL THE PHILOSOPHY, ALL THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE WORLD, YOU HAD IT ALL AND LOST YOUR SOUL? IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT. AND YET, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR SOUL FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IT. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT TO HAVE MONEY. NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE DOES GOD CONDEMN A WEALTHY MAN UNLESS HE MISUSES IT OR UNLESS HE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY. THEN HE'S CONDEMNED. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, ""KNOW YE NOT ""THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE WORLD IS ENMITY WITH GOD? ""WHOSOEVER THEREFORE WILL BE A FRIEND OF THE WORLD ""IS THE ENEMY OF GOD."" NOW WHAT DOES THAT WORD ""WORLD"" MEAN? IT'S COSMOS , IT MEANS A WORLD SYSTEM DOMINATED BY EVIL. THAT EVIL PART OF THE WORLD'S SYSTEM IN WHICH WE LIVE. FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT MEANS ENMITY WITH GOD. AND GOD SAYS, ""COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND BE YE SEPARATE ""SAITH THE LORD AND TOUCH NOT THE UNCLEAN THING."" WORLDLINESS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MEANT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT PEOPLE HAD WITH THEIR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. NOW PERHAPS YOU SAW THOSE HUGE PICTURES ON TELEVISION A FEW MONTHS AGO OF SOME FORTY WHALES, WHO FOR SOME UNKNOWN BIOLOGICAL REASON BEACHED THEMSELVES AND DIED. THEY LEFT THEIR LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR ONE OF DEATH AND DIED. AND MANY OF YOU HAVE LEFT THE ENVIRONMENT OF LIVING IN THE SCRIPTURES AND LIVING FOR GOD, AND GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD AND YOUR SOUL IS DEAD TOWARD GOD. IT'S LIKE THE LEMMING IN SCANDINAVIA. THEY BAND TOGETHER. AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WALK DOWN INTO THE OCEAN AND DIE. YOU DELIBERATELY BRING ON YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL DEATH. YOU PROMOTE YOUR OWN ETERNAL DEATH BY GOING WITH THE EVILS OF THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU. AND THE WORLD ROUND ABOUT YOU SQUEEZES YOU INTO ITS MOLD AND IT BECOMES A HINDRANCE TO YOU COMING TO JESUS CHRIST. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE WRONG THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WORLD; THE LUST AND THE GREED AND THE HATE AND THE PREJUDICE AND THE MATERIALISM PART OF THE WORLD THAT'S WRONG, YOU HAVE TO TURN FROM WHEN YOU COME TO CHRIST. AND THAT'S THE REASON IT'S SO HARD TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE MODERN DAY. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I'M NOT GOING TO FOOL YOU. I WOULD THINK IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO BE A CHRISTIAN RIGHT NOW IN MODERN AMERICA OR MODERN WESTERN WORLD THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD. YOU SEE TO BE A CHRISTIAN IN SOME PARTS OF THE ORIENT OR SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO REALLY STAND FOR CHRIST AND YOU HAVE TO SUFFER. BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S NO SUFFERING AND NO PHYSICAL PERSECUTION IT'S RATHER EASY JUST TO SLIDE ALONG, REALLY NOT KNOWING CHRIST. CALLING YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN BUT NOT REALLY BEING A CHRISTIAN, NOT A NEW TESTAMENT CHRISTIAN. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT HAVE GONE TO CHURCH ALL THEIR LIVES AND BEEN BAPTIZED AND CONFIRMED BUT STILL NOT KNOWING CHRIST. AND THEN ANOTHER OBSTACLE ARE SECRET SINS THE BIBLE SAYS. THE PSALMIST PRAYED, ""CLEANSE THOU ME FROM SECRET THOUGHTS."" AND PAUL WROTE TO THE ROMANS, ""THE DAY WHEN GOD SHALL JUDGE THE SECRETS OF MEN ""BY JESUS CHRIST."" YOU CAN KEEP NO SECRETS FROM GOD. YOUR FRIENDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW. AND GOD HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THEM. IT'S LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK ON TELEVISION. I THINK I'VE SEEN IT ONCE, MAYBE TWICE. BUT I READ ABOUT IT. AND IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY, IT'S TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PERSON INSIDE OF HIM, ALWAYS. AND PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN BATTLING WITH THE HIDDEN MAN IN YOUR HEART WITH YOUR SECRET SINS. CONFESS THEM TO CHRIST TONIGHT. COME TO THE CROSS AND BRING THOSE SECRETS OF YOUR HEART AND LAY THEM BEFORE HIM AND SAY, ""LORD, HERE THEY ARE. ""I SURRENDER."" AND THEN SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ANOTHER THING THAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM CHRIST. ""THERE IS A GENERATION,"" THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THAT ARE PURE IN THEIR OWN EYES ""AND YET THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WASHED FROM THEIR FILTHINESS."" PURE IN OUR OWN EYES. PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE BAD. SAYING WE'RE GOOD WHEN ACTUALLY WE'RE SINNING AND BREAKING GOD'S LAWS. THAT KEEPS US FROM CHRIST, SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOW WE'VE SEEN THE OBSTACLES, LET'S LOOK AT JESUS. IT'S A PERSONAL CALL. JESUS TURNS TO ZACCHAEUS AND CALLS HIM BY NAME. HE SEES ZACCHAEUS UP THE TREE. YOU SEE ZACCHAEUS HAD CLIMBED A SYCAMORE TREE AND WAS OUT ON THE LIMB, SITTING THERE WATCHING JESUS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST HATED MAN IN TOWN, THE MOST SINFUL MAN IN TOWN HEARS HIS NAME CALLED BY THE GREAT PROPHET, JESUS. AND JESUS SAYS, ""ZACCHAEUS."" CAN YOU IMAGE HOW STARTLED HE WAS THAT OUT OF ALL THAT CROWD AND THOSE RELIGIOUS LEADERS, HE, THE WORST SINNER IN TOWN, CALLED BY HIS NAME? THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS IS THE GOOD SHEPHERD. HE CALLETH HIS OWN SHEEP BY NAME AND LEADETH THEM. IN GENESIS WE READ THAT GOD CAME IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN PERSONALLY TO CALL ADAM. HE SAID, ""ADAM, ADAM, WHERE ART THOU?"" AND LATER HE CALLED ABRAHAM. HE SAID, ""ABRAHAM, JACOB, MOSES, JOSHUA, GIDEON, SAMUEL, ""DAVID, SOLOMON."" HE CALLED THEM ALL BY NAME. ""ISAIAH, JEREMIAH, EZEKIEL, DANIEL."" HE CALLED THEM BY NAME. AND THEN WHEN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST CAME HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES BY NAME. HE WENT DOWN BY THE SEASHORE AND HE CALLED OUT, ""SIMON PETER, ""ANDREW, JAMES, JOHN."" AND FROM THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM ANOTHER MAN, LIKE ZACCHAEUS, A TAX GATHERER, ""MATTHEW, COME AND FOLLOW ME."" AND HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED JESUS IMMEDIATELY. AND ON THE DAMASCUS ROAD, HE SAID, ""SAUL, SAUL, SAUL, WHY DO YOU PERSECUTE ME?"" AND ON THE ISLE OF PATMOS, HE SAID, ""JOHN."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. WHAT IS YOUR NAME; JIM, MARY, SUSIE, PETER? HE CALLED YOU BY NAME TONIGHT. HE KNOWS YOUR NAME. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MARY, GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT ""AND COME AND RECEIVE ME TONIGHT. ""I WANT TO COME INTO YOUR HOUSE AND INTO YOUR HEART."" ""JIM, YOU NEED ME. ""YOU KNOW YOU NEED ME TO HELP YOU, TO FORGIVE YOU, ""TO TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN. ""GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME."" HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. HE LOOKED UP IN THE TREE AND SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS."" AND IT WAS AN URGENT CALL. HE SAID, ""ZACCHAEUS, MAKE HASTE, HURRY. ""WE DON'T HAVE LONG."" AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS TO YOU. HURRY, MAKE HASTE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO CHRIST, COME NOW. YOU MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT LIKE THIS. NOWHERE DOES THE BIBLE PROMISE TOMORROW YOU CAN BE SAVED. IT'S TODAY; TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. NOW IS THE ACCEPTED TIME. THERE MAY NOT BE A TOMORROW FOR YOU. THERE'S A LITTLE VERSE IN YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT SOMETIMES I MISS WHEN I HEAR IT SUNG. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. ""OH LORD OUR GOD, ARISE ON THEE OUR HOPES WE FIX. ""GOD SAVE US ALL."" TONIGHT THAT WOULD BE MY PRAYER FOR YOU. GOD SAVE US ALL. AND THAT'S WHAT THE LORD JESUS CAME ""TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH IS LOST."" TODAY HE'S URGENTLY CALLING YOU BY NAME. AND IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL CALL BECAUSE ZACCHAEUS DID MAKE HASTE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE DIDN'T WAIT TO CLIMB DOWN THE TREE. HE JUMPED. AND D.L. MOODY, THE EVANGELIST OF THE LAST CENTURY, SAID THAT ZACCHAEUS WAS CONVERTED FROM THE LIMB TO THE GROUND. AND I EXPECT THAT'S ABOUT TRUE. THE RICH YOUNG RULER CAME TO JESUS. HE FELL DOWN BEFORE JESUS. HE WAS RUNNING TO JESUS. MAKING HASTE TO GET TO JESUS. AND HE GOT TO JESUS, BUT HE COULDN'T PAY THE PRICE. AND HE WAS LOST EVEN THOUGH JESUS LOVED HIM AND JESUS TRIED AND JESUS TALKED WITH HIM AND GAVE HIM PRECIOUS TIME. YET THAT YOUNG MAN NEVER CAME TO JESUS. BUT ZACCHAEUS, THE GREAT SINNER, DID COME TO JESUS. AND JESUS WENT TO ZACCHAEUS' HOME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK JESUS PROBABLY TOOK MATTHEW WITH HIM. AND I EXPECT THAT MATTHEW AND ZACCHAEUS GOT INTO A CONVERSATION LATE INTO THE NIGHT. AND MATTHEW TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. HOW HE HAD BEEN ALSO A TAX GATHERER AND HOW HE HAD BEEN A SINNER AND HOW JESUS HAD CALLED HIM BY NAME. AND HE SAID, ""FOLLOW ME."" AND MATTHEW SAID, ""I GOT UP RIGHT THEN AND FOLLOWED HIM ""AND I'VE NEVER REGRETTED ONE MINUTE OF IT. ""HE CHANGED MY LIFE, HE'S GIVEN ME ASSURANCE. ""HE'S BLESSED MY FAMILY. ""HE'S BROUGHT OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. ""OH, I'D DIE FOR HIM. ""I'VE GIVEN HIM MY LIFE."" AND ZACCHAEUS HEARD THAT. AND I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM THAT NIGHT, ""YOU KNOW ZACCHAEUS, ""IF YOU COME TO CHRIST, IF YOU COME TO JESUS, ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME RESTITUTION. ""YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE WAY OF LIVING. ""AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECLARE OPENLY ""YOUR ALLEGIANCE FOR JESUS CHRIST."" WE'RE TO BE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT OF IT. WE LIVE IN TWO WORLDS. WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD, BUT WE'RE ALSO CITIZENS OF ANOTHER WORLD, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. AND OUR FIRST ALLEGIANCE IS ALWAYS TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. YES, I IMAGINE MATTHEW TOLD HIM ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WHAT WAS THE RESULT? THE RESULT WAS THAT ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST. NOW RECEIVING CHRIST INVOLVES AN ACT OF FAITH BEYOND MERE HUMAN REASON. THE BIBLE SAYS, ""THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVETH NOT ""THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD ""FOR THEY'RE FOOLISHNESS UNTO HIM. ""NEITHER CAN HE KNOW THEM BECAUSE ""THEY'RE SPIRITUALLY DISCERNED."" IN OTHER WORDS, A NATURAL PERSON LIKE YOU JUST CANNOT COME AND REASON HIS WAY TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. YOU CANNOT REASON YOUR WAY TO CHRIST. I DON'T IMAGINE ZACCHAEUS SAT DOWN AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE PHILOSOPHY AND ALL THE THEOLOGICAL DEBATES ABOUT JESUS. HE JUST JOYFULLY RECEIVED HIM BY FAITH. SIMPLY LIKE A LITTLE CHILD. AND JESUS RECEIVED HIM AND FORGAVE HIM. YOU SEE CHRIST IS KNOCKING ON OUR HEART'S DOOR TONIGHT. HE'S ASKING PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO RECEIVE HIM. AND THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SAYING, THEY ACCUSED HIM BY SAYING, ""THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS."" ARE YOU A SINNER? HAVE YOU BROKEN GOD'S LAW? I'M A SINNER. ARE YOU? SURE YOU ARE. HE RECEIVETH SINNERS. ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL THING THAT HE RECEIVETH SINNERS? AND WHEN I STAND, AND IF THEY SHOULD ASK ME AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN WHEN I DIE, ""WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?"" I'M GOING TO SAY, ""I'M HERE BY THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD ""BECAUSE OF WHAT JESUS CHRIST DID ON THE CROSS. ""I'M NOT HERE BY ANY GOOD WORKS BILLY GRAHAM EVER DID."" I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PREACHED IN A BIG STADIUM FULL OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS TONIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE READ THE BIBLE. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE I'VE PRAYED. I'M NOT GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN WIFE AND FIVE CHRISTIAN CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD. I'M A SINNER. I DESERVE JUDGMENT, I DESERVE HELL. I'M GOING BECAUSE OF CHRIST. AND I HAVE RECEIVED CHRIST. I'VE LET HIM COME INTO MY HEART. AND I'VE COME TO THE CROSS. HE'S FORGIVEN MY SIN. I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. I KNOW I'M SAVED TONIGHT. I KNOW WHERE I'VE COME FROM. I KNOW WHY I'M HERE. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. AND IF HE SHOULD COME TONIGHT, I'M READY. DO YOU KNOW THAT? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? THIS MAN RECEIVETH SINNERS. ""BUT AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, ""TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME SONS OF GOD ""EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ON HIS NAME."" YOU RECEIVE HIM AND LET HIM COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND YOU'LL FIND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE JOYFUL. WITHOUT CHRIST TO FILL THAT EMPTY VOID IN YOUR LIFE NOTHING ELSE SATISFIES. SEX DOESN'T DO IT. DRUGS DOESN'T DO IT. POWER, POPULARITY, ALL OF THAT IS NOTHING. CHRIST IS EVERYTHING. AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE CHRIST YOU'RE READY TO LIVE HERE AND NOW. LIFE WITH A CAPITAL L WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR SAVIOR. YES, ZACCHAEUS RECEIVED CHRIST JOYFULLY. AND NOTICE ANOTHER THING, ZACCHAEUS OPENLY CONFESSED CHRIST, PUBLICLY. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF ALL OF HIS FRIENDS IN THE WHOLE TOWN AND HE SAID, ""I'VE BEEN WRONG, I'VE BEEN A SINNER. ""I'M READY TO RESTORE EVERYTHING I EVER DID IF NECESSARY. ""WHATEVER IT TAKES. ""FROM NOW ON I'M FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST. ""HE IS MY LORD AND HE IS MY SAVIOR. ""HE CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE ME IN THIS TOWN OF JERICHO."" HE CAME TO HALIFAX IN THE FORM OF THIS CRUSADE TO SEEK AND TO SAVE YOU. AND HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE, COME WHILE THERE'S TIME."" BECAUSE YOU SEE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER DENIETH THE SON, THE SAME HATH NOT THE FATHER. ""HE THAT CONFESSED THE SON OPENLY ""HATH THE FATHER ALSO."" ALSO THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ""WHOSOEVER SHALL CONFESS THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD ""DWELLETH IN HIM AND HE IN GOD."" AND JESUS SAID, ""IF YOU DENY ME BEFORE MEN."" IF YOU DENY ME PUBLICLY; ""I'LL NOT CONFESS YOU ""BEFORE MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN."" YOU SEE JESUS CHRIST HUNG ON THE CROSS PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, DYING, BLEEDING FOR YOU. AND HE ASKS YOU TO PUBLICLY RECEIVE HIM. AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO THAT IN A MOMENT. THERE'RE THREE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO. FIRST, LISTEN TO THIS SO YOU CAN NEVER STAND AT THE JUDGMENT AND SAY, ""I NEVER KNEW."" FIRST, YOU MUST REPENT OF YOUR SIN. HOW DO YOU REPENT? THE WORD REPENT MEANS TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. IT MEANS TO TURN. YOU'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION IN YOUR LIFE, YOU TURN AROUND AND START IN A NEW DIRECTION. NOW, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TURN BY YOURSELF. IF FACT YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO SAY, ""LORD, HELP ME TO TURN, ""HELP ME TO REPENT."" IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LET CHRIST COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR WHOLE PATTERN OF LIVING, YOUR LIFESTYLE, EVERYTHING, IF NECESSARY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING, BY FAITH YOU RECEIVE HIM. NOW THAT WORD FAITH MAY CAUSE YOU TO STUMBLE. IT MEANS THAT YOU COMMIT, THAT YOU SURRENDER YOUR TOTAL LIFE  TO JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER GOD, YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANY OTHER RELIGION. YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING ANYTHING BUT JESUS CHRIST AND HIM ALONE TO SAVE YOU. THAT'S FAITH, TOTAL COMMITMENT TO CHRIST. AND THEN THIRDLY, YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW HIM. YOU'RE WILLING TO BE HIS DISCIPLE. NOW THE WORD DISCIPLE MEANS LEARNER OR DISCIPLINE. IT MEANS DISCIPLINED LEARNING. YOU'RE FOLLOWING HIM. GROWING IN THE GRACE AND KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BY STUDYING THE BIBLE, BY PRAYER, BY WITNESSING, BY ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH. YOU SAY, ""WELL, BILLY, YOU KNOW MOST OF THOSE THINGS ""I'M ALREADY DOING."" BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW CHRIST? ARE YOU SURE OF IT? IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, IF YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN THAT CHRIST IS IN YOUR HEART TONIGHT AND THAT YOUR SIN IS FORGIVEN, HE'S CALLING YOU BY NAME. HE SEES YOU. AND HE SAYS, ""MAKE HASTE AND COME."" I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT RIGHT NOW, HUNDREDS OF YOU FROM EVERYWHERE AS WE'VE SEEN EVERY NIGHT. GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME AND STAND IN FRONT. AND SAY BY COMING, ""I WANT TO COME TO THE CROSS ""BY FAITH TONIGHT AND I WANT MY SINS FORGIVEN. ""I WANT TO KNOW THAT I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. ""I WANT TO KNOW I'M GOING TO HEAVEN."" YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW, QUICKLY AND STAND HERE. IF YOU'RE WITH FRIENDS OR RELATIVES THEY'LL WAIT. AND AFTER YOU COME, I'M GOING TO SAY A WORD TO YOU AND HAVE A PRAYER WITH YOU. AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME LITERATURE TO HELP YOU IN YOUR CHRISTIAN LIFE. AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND JOIN YOUR FRIENDS. BUT I'M GOING TO ASK NO ONE TO LEAVE THE STADIUM NOW AT THIS HOLY MOMENT. EVERYONE IN AN ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY COMING. YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW TOO. GOD IS CALLING YOU BY NAME. JESUS IS LOOKING IN YOUR DIRECTION. AND HE KNOWS YOUR HEART AND HE SAYS, ""COME."" YOU GET UP AND COME QUICKLY.
