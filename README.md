# ChurchTopics
ChurchTopics is a project that uses machine learning to analyze and classify church sermons based on their topics and sentiment. It involves gathering sermon data, preprocessing it, and applying natural language processing techniques to categorize themes (e.g., forgiveness, hope) and assess emotional tones (e.g., positive, negative).
